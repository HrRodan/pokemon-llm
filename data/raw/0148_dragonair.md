## Identity & Lore
Dragonair (Pokedex #148) is the Dragon Pokémon, a sleek and serpentine creature introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Residing primarily at the **water's edge** in pristine lakes and seas, this Pokémon is enveloped in a gentle, mystical aura. Lore dictates that Dragonair has the innate power to freely control the climate; its body discharges energy to change the weather, often causing rain or storms to appear instantly. Unlike its final evolution, Dragonair retains a refined, snake-like elegance with blue scales and crystal orbs on its neck and tail. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is highly valued by Trainers for its usage of the **Eviolite** item, which boosts its defenses before it evolves.

## Evolution & Biology
Dragonair is the middle stage of a pseudo-legendary, **3-stage evolutionary line**. It evolves from **Dratini** starting at **Level 30**. It continues to grow, eventually evolving into the powerful **Dragonite** starting at **Level 55**. Uniquely, Dragonair belongs to both the **Dragon** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, reflecting its aquatic habitat. In the wild, it may occasionally carry a **Dragon Scale** or **Dragon Fang**. Its growth rate is slow, requiring patience to reach its final form.
