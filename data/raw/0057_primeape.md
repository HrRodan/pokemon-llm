## Identity & Lore
Primeape (Pokedex #057) is the Pig Monkey Pokémon, originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This bipedal, mammalian creature is characterized by its light brown fur, pig-like nose, and the pulsating veins on its forehead that indicate its perpetual state of extreme aggression. According to biological research, Primeape becomes furious if it detects eye contact and will chase its quarry relentlessly across its **Mountain** habitat until caught. Its rage is so potent that some lore suggests it can become so angry that it dies, a physiological state that ironically transcends into its ghost-type evolution. While it originated as a two-stage line, recent discoveries in the Paldea region established that Primeape is capable of evolving further into the Ghost/Fighting-type **Annihilape**.
