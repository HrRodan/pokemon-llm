## Identity & Lore
Phanpy (Pokedex #231) is the Long Nose Pokémon, a ground-dwelling species first discovered in **Generation II (Johto)**. Small, blue, and quadrupedal, Phanpy is characterized by the red pads on its large ears and its expressive snout. It typically inhabits **rough terrain** where it can utilize its natural hardiness. While generally spirited and affectionate, Phanpy possesses deceptively high physical strength; it is known to swing its long snout around playfully, which can be dangerous enough to send an adult human flying if they are struck. Although Phanpy itself does not possess alternate forms, its evolution, Donphan, is biologically linked to the Paradox Pokémon **Great Tusk** (Ancient) and **Iron Treads** (Future) discovered in the Paldea region.
