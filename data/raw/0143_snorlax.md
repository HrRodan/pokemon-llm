## Identity & Lore
Snorlax (Pokedex #143) is the Sleeping Pokémon, a massive Normal-type creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its immense size and lethargic nature, this black-colored giant spends the majority of its life sleeping and eating. It requires over 900 pounds of food daily to feel satisfied and possesses an incredibly durable stomach capable of digesting even moldy or rotten food without illness. Snorlax typically inhabits mountainous regions and is famously known in folklore for accidentally blocking paths and bridges due to its rotund bulk. While it does not have a standard evolution, Snorlax possesses a Gigantamax form in the Galar region, where it becomes immobile, and a majestic tree and ecosystem sprout from its belly.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker / Special Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** types. As a Normal type, it has no natural resistances, but it is **immune to Ghost** type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and extreme durability, key moves include **Body Slam** (for STAB and paralysis utility), **Earthquake** (for coverage), **Rest** (to fully restore HP), and **Curse** (to boost Attack and Defense at the cost of Speed). **Heavy Slam** is also viable given its massive weight.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Immunity:** Prevents the Pokémon from being poisoned.
    *   **Thick Fat:** Grants a functional resistance by halving the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves.
    *   **Gluttony (Hidden):** Encourages the Pokémon to eat a held Berry at 50% HP instead of the usual 25%, often used with "Pinch Berries" for rapid recovery.

## Evolution & Biology
Snorlax is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Munchlax** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (Happiness value of 160 or higher). Snorlax is frequently found holding **Leftovers**, an item that gradually restores health. It belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group.
