## Identity & Lore
Crobat (Pokedex #169) is the Bat Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). This purple, nocturnal creature is the final stage of the Zubat line, distinguished by the development of a second pair of wings which allow it to fly faster and more quietly than its predecessors. Its flavor text notes that it flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it often goes unnoticed by prey even when nearby. Predominantly found in caves, Crobat is a master of stealth flight. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its incredible speed makes it a notorious threat in the wild.
