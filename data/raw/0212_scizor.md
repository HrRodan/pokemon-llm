## Identity & Lore
Scizor (Pokedex #212) is the Pincer Pokémon, a Bug and Steel-type entity first recorded in the Johto region (Generation II). Distinguished by its crimson, steel-hard exoskeleton, Scizor is an evolution of Scyther that has traded speed for immense defense and crushing power. It inhabits grasslands, where it intimidates rivals by raising its heavy pincers, which feature unique eye-patterns to confuse enemies. While not explicitly detailed in standard biological surveys, Scizor possesses the potential to undergo **Mega Evolution** into Mega Scizor, further tempering its armor and offensive capabilities.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 130, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 80, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Sweeper / Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** Scizor possesses a phenomenal defensive typing; it suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire** but is immune to Poison and resists a vast array of types including Normal, Grass, Ice, Psychic, Bug, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 130 Attack stat and Technician synergy, key moves include **Bullet Punch** (priority STAB), **U-turn** (for tactical pivoting), **Swords Dance** (to boost Attack), and **Roost** (for longevity).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Swarm:** Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Technician:** Increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%. This is Scizor's most competitively viable ability, turning moves like Bullet Punch into devastating weapons.
    *   **Light Metal (Hidden):** Halves the Pokémon's weight, reducing damage from weight-dependent moves like Low Kick.

## Evolution & Biology
Scizor is part of a branched 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Scyther** specifically when **traded while holding a Metal Coat**. Scyther has an alternative evolutionary path where it becomes **Kleavor** when exposed to Black Augurite. Scizor belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 25 egg cycles.
