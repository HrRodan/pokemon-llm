## Identity & Lore
Magmar (Pokedex #126) is the **Spitfire Pokémon**, a bipedal creature composed of living flame introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Its body burns with a constant orange glow, allowing it to camouflage perfectly within natural fires. Magmar typically inhabits active volcanoes and rugged **mountains**, where it heals its wounds by dipping them into lava. Its body temperature can exceed 2,200 degrees Fahrenheit, causing the air around it to shimmer with heat. Magmar is historically considered a counterpart to the Electric-type Electabuzz. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the middle stage of a powerful lineage capable of wielding intense heat.
