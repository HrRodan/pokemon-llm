## Identity & Lore
Spearow (Pokedex #021) is the **Tiny Bird Pokémon** introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Distinct from the more docile Pidgey, this avian Pokémon possesses a brown plumage and resides primarily in **rough-terrain** and grassy areas. According to research, it must flap its short wings at high speeds to stay airborne, darting through tall grass to snatch prey with its beak. Known for its territorial nature, Spearow has a very loud cry that can be heard over half a mile away, often serving as a warning to others of its kind. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it is recognized for its tenacity despite its small size.

## Evolution & Biology
Spearow is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Fearow** starting at **Level 20**. Belonging to the **Flying** Egg Group, it has a hatch counter of 15 cycles. In the wild, it is occasionally found holding a **Sharp Beak**, which boosts the power of its Flying-type attacks. Its biology dictates a high metabolism, requiring it to eat frequently to maintain the energy needed for its rapid wing movement.
