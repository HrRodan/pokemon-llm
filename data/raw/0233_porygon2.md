## Identity & Lore
Porygon2 (Pokedex #233) is the Virtual Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). This artificial life form is the direct result of upgrading the original Porygon with new data designed for planetary development and space exploration. Unlike its predecessor, Porygon2 is capable of learning and adapting, occasionally displaying reactions and behaviors that were not originally part of its programming, suggesting a degree of artificial sentience. While designed for the vacuum of space, it notably cannot fly. It typically resides in urban environments near research centers. Porygon2 is widely recognized in competitive lore for its extreme durability when utilizing the Eviolite item, often outlasting its final evolution in defensive capability.

## Combat Profile

*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and holds a distinct **immunity to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.

It is also a premier user of **Trick Room** due to its low Speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Porygon2 is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line within the Mineral Egg Group. It evolves from Porygon when **traded while holding an Up-Grade**. It can further evolve into Porygon-Z when **traded while holding a Dubious Disc**. Because it is an artificial construct made of programming code, Porygon2 is genderless and does not require oxygen to breathe.
