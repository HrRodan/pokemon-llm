## Identity & Lore
Torchic (Pokedex #255) is the Chick Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn) as the region's Fire-type Starter. A small, avian creature covered in soft, orange feathers, Torchic is known for sticking close to its Trainer with unsteady steps. Despite its cute appearance, it possesses a flame sac inside its belly that burns at over 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing it to breathe scorching fireballs capable of turning foes black. While found in grasslands, Torchic is the first stage of a powerful lineage that eventually gains the Fighting type and possesses the potential for **Mega Evolution** in its final form.
