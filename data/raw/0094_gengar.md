## Identity & Lore
Gengar (Pokedex #094) is the Shadow Pokémon, a dual-type Ghost/Poison entity originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). Characterized by its sinister grin and deep purple coloration, this spectral creature inhabits caves and dark urban areas. Lore dictates that under a full moon, Gengar mimics the shadows of humans to laugh at their fright, absorbing their life force. While the provided data reflects its standard form, Gengar possesses significant hidden potential, capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Gengar (revealing a third eye) and achieving a **Gigantamax** form known for its gaping mouth leading to the afterlife.
