## Identity & Lore
Beedrill (Pokedex #015) is the aggressive **Poison Bee Pokémon** first discovered in the Kanto region (**Generation I**). Distinguished by its striking yellow and black coloration, it possesses three deadly, poisonous stingers—one on each foreleg and a massive one on its abdomen—which it uses to jab foes repeatedly with high-speed attacks. Beedrill are highly territorial creatures found primarily in **forests**, often attacking in swarms if their hive is disturbed. While its standard form is fragile, it possesses the latent potential to undergo **Mega Evolution** into Mega Beedrill, transforming it into a high-velocity projectile capable of immense piercing power.
