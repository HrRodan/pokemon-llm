## Identity & Lore
Golbat (Pokedex #042) is the Bat Pokémon, a dual-type Poison/Flying creature originally discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Recognized by its large, gaping mouth and purple body, Golbat is a nocturnal predator that resides primarily in dark caves. Its voracious appetite is a defining characteristic; lore states that once it strikes, it will not stop draining energy or blood from its victim, often feeding until it becomes too heavy to fly. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Golbat is notable in competitive lore for being a highly effective user of the **Eviolite** item, which boosts the defenses of Pokémon that can still evolve, allowing it to function as a bulky pivot despite being a middle-stage evolution.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Inner Focus:** Protects the Pokémon from flinching and prevents its stats from being lowered by the ability Intimidate.

## Evolution & Biology
Golbat is the middle stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Zubat** starting at **Level 22**. To reach its final form, Golbat must evolve into **Crobat**; this transformation is triggered when leveled up with **High Friendship** (220 or higher). It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 15 cycles.
