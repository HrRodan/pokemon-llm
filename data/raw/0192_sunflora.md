## Identity & Lore
Sunflora (Pokedex #192) is the Sun Pokémon, a vibrant, bipedal plant-based creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Distinctly recognized by its cheerful demeanor and large, sunflower-like face, this yellow humanoid Pokémon thrives in sun-drenched **grassland** habitats. Its biology is intrinsically linked to the solar cycle; according to ecological research, it actively moves and converts sunlight into energy during the day but closes its petals and becomes completely still in the darkness after sunset to conserve power. While it possesses no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is emblematic of sun-based weather teams in Pokémon lore.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 75, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 85, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Slow Special Wallbreaker / Sun Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Grass-type**, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice** moves. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and low Speed, Sunflora's optimal kit often utilizes **Solar Beam** (for immediate damage in harsh sunlight), **Earth Power** (critical coverage against Fire and Poison types), **Sludge Bomb** (anti-Grass coverage), and **Giga Drain** (for sustain) or **Synthesis** (for reliable recovery).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Chlorophyll:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during harsh sunlight, potentially mitigating its naturally low speed.
    *   **Solar Power:** Boosts Special Attack by 1.5x during harsh sunlight but decreases HP by 1/8th of its maximum at the end of each turn, turning Sunflora into a fragile but devastating cannon.
    *   **Early Bird (Hidden):** The Pokémon awakens from sleep twice as fast as other Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Sunflora is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sunkern** when exposed to a **Sun Stone**. This evolution is unique as it transforms one of the statistically weakest Pokémon (Sunkern) into a capable special attacker. It belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
