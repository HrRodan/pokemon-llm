## Identity & Lore
Porygon (Pokedex #137) is the Virtual Pokémon, a unique artificial entity first introduced in Generation I (Kanto). It is the world's first man-made Pokémon, created by the scientists at Silph Co. using advanced programming code rather than biological matter. Because it consists entirely of data, it possesses the unique ability to revert to program code and move freely through cyberspace, allowing it to infiltrate computer networks. While it is primarily found in urban environments where technology is prevalent, its pink, polyhedral body is distinctively geometric. Unlike biological Pokémon, Porygon does not require breathing or feeding in the traditional sense. It does not possess any known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, though its evolutionary line represents a progression of software upgrades.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 60, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 75, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Slow Special Attacker / Trick Room Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a valuable **immunity to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack (85) and low Speed, key moves include **Tri Attack** (STAB with status potential), **Ice Beam** and **Thunderbolt** (providing the famous "BoltBeam" coverage), and **Recover** for longevity. **Trick Room** is also highly viable to turn its low speed into an advantage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Trace:** Copies the Ability of an opponent upon entering battle, offering versatile tactical advantages.
    *   **Download:** Compares the opposing Pokémon's Defense and Sp. Def, then boosts Porygon's Attack or Sp. Atk corresponding to the lower stat.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last, synergizing perfectly with Porygon's low Speed stat.

## Evolution & Biology
Porygon is the base stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line that functions via hardware and software patches. It evolves into **Porygon2** when traded while holding the **Up-Grade** item, representing a major version update. Porygon2 can subsequently evolve into **Porygon-Z** when traded holding the **Dubious Disc**, a modification that corrupts its programming for higher power. Porygon belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, though it is genderless and can only breed with Ditto.
