## Identity & Lore
Alakazam (Pokedex #065) is the Psi Pokémon, a highly intelligent humanoid creature originating from **Generation I (Kanto)**. Renowned for its unparalleled mental capabilities, its brain cells multiply continually until death, granting it an IQ commonly cited at 5,000. This massive brain outperforms supercomputers, allowing Alakazam to remember everything it has ever experienced. To support its heavy head, it uses its psychokinetic powers to keep its body upright. It is rarely found in the wild but tends to inhabit **urban** areas near humans. While not explicitly listed in standard forms, Alakazam is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Alakazam, where it gains a third eye and levitates multiple spoons to amplify its psychic power.

## Evolution & Biology
Alakazam is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the **Humanshape** egg group. It begins life as **Abra**, which evolves into **Kadabra** upon reaching **Level 16**. The final evolution into Alakazam is triggered specifically via **Trade** (historically requiring a Link Cable connection). This evolutionary method emphasizes the transfer of energy or data as a catalyst for its biological maturity.
