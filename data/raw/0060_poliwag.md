## Identity & Lore
Poliwag (Pokédex #060) is the Tadpole Pokémon, originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). This small, blue amphibian is defined by the distinctive spiral pattern on its belly; according to biological studies, this swirl is actually its internal organs visible through its thin, semi-transparent skin. While it possesses newly grown legs, Poliwag is clumsy on land and prefers to inhabit the water's edge, where it is far more agile. The direction of its belly spiral can vary by region, with the swirl twisting differently depending on the hemisphere.
