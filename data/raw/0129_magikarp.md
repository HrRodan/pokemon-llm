## Identity & Lore
Magikarp (Pokedex #129) is the infamous Fish Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Universally recognized for being pathetic and unreliable, this red, fish-shaped Pokémon inhabits the water's edge of lakes and rivers across the world. Its biology is defined by its feeble nature; ancient records suggest it was once somewhat stronger than the horribly weak descendants that exist today. Despite its reputation as the weakest Pokémon, it possesses remarkable survival instincts and is capable of leaping high into the air. While Magikarp itself is largely non-combatant, it harbors immense latent potential, serving as the pre-evolution to the atrocious Gyarados, which gains access to both Mega Evolution and Gigantamax forms in later generations.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 20, Attack 10, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 15, Sp. Def 20, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Joke Character / Speed-Reliant Reversal.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water type, it is **weak to Electric and Grass**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its abysmal offensive stats, Magikarp relies on mechanics that bypass standard damage calculation or utility. Its limited move pool includes **Flail** (which deals maximum damage when HP is low), **Bounce** (providing a turn of semi-invulnerability and a chance to paralyze), **Tackle**, and the iconic but useless **Splash**. Note: While its Special Attack is technically higher than its Attack, it lacks a viable special move pool aside from event-exclusive moves like Hydro Pump.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat in rain, making Magikarp surprisingly fast (160 effective Speed base).
    *   **Rattled (Hidden):** Speed is raised by one stage when hit by a Bug, Ghost, or Dark-type move, allowing it to potentially outspeed opponents before using Flail.

## Evolution & Biology
Magikarp is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line characterized by a drastic increase in power. It evolves into **Gyarados** starting at **Level 20**. This evolution is famously difficult to achieve for novice trainers due to Magikarp's inability to battle effectively. It belongs to the **Water 2** and **Dragon** Egg Groups and has a very low Hatch Counter (5 cycles), making it the fastest Pokémon to breed and hatch.
