## Identity & Lore
Mantine (Pokedex #226) is the Kite Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Flying creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in the sea, this purple, ray-like Pokémon is renowned for its majestic swimming style. It shares a unique symbiotic relationship with the Pokémon Remoraid; the flavor text notes that Mantine allows Remoraid to attach to its fins to scavenge for leftovers, displaying a docile and communal temperament. While Mantine does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its distinct silhouette—resembling a kite soaring underwater—makes it an iconic aquatic species.

    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain.

## Evolution & Biology
Mantine is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Mantyke** when leveled up, but strictly under the unique condition that a **Remoraid** is present in the trainer's party. This biological requirement reflects the species' lore regarding their symbiotic bond. Mantine belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 25 egg cycles.
