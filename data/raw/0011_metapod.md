## Identity & Lore
Metapod (Pokedex #011) is the Cocoon Pokémon, a pure Bug-type entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Residing primarily in forests, this green, crescent-shaped Pokémon represents a transitional metamorphosis state. Its biology dictates a passive existence; it does not move much to conserve energy for its impending evolution. While its exterior shell appears steel-hard, the body inside is soft and tender, making it vulnerable to strong impacts if the shell is cracked. Consequently, Metapod often remains motionless among leaves to camouflage itself from predators. It is the intermediate stage in the lifecycle of the Butterfree line.
