## Identity & Lore
Rapidash (Pokédex #078) is the Fire Horse Pokémon, a quadrupedal creature known for its blistering speed and competitive spirit. First discovered in the **Kanto** region (Generation I), this yellow-hued Pokémon inhabits **grasslands** where it can gallop freely. Rapidash possesses a mane and tail composed of searing flames, which stream out behind it as it runs; lore dictates that it can reach speeds of up to 150 mph, chasing anything that moves fast in hopes of racing it. While this profile focuses on the standard Fire-type form, it is worth noting that a regional variant, **Galarian Rapidash**, exists in the Galar region, which adopts the Psychic/Fairy typing.

## Evolution & Biology
Rapidash is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Ponyta** starting at **Level 40**. Rapidash belongs to the **Field** (listed as Ground in data) Egg Group, and hatchlings require approximately 20 egg cycles. Its physiology is built for running; its hooves are harder than diamonds, allowing it to trample opponents with moves like Stomp or High Horsepower.
