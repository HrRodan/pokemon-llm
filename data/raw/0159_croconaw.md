## Identity & Lore
Croconaw (Pokedex #159) is the Big Jaw Pokémon, a Water-type entity first discovered in the **Johto** region (Generation II). Residing primarily near the **water's edge**, this bipedal, blue crocodilian is defined by its ferocious bite. Its mouth is lined with 48 distinct fangs; according to biological studies, if it loses a fang, a new one immediately grows back in its place, ensuring its predatory efficiency is never compromised. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the crucial transitional stage for the Johto Water Starter line.
