## Identity & Lore
Seel (Pokédex #086) is the Sea Lion Pokémon introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This marine mammal is easily recognized by its snow-white pelt and the protruding horn on its head, which is exceptionally hard and used for bashing through thick ice floes in its native sea habitat. Seel thrives in cold environments, swimming gracefully through icy waters where its light blue fur provides camouflage against icebergs. While it moves awkwardly on land, it is a graceful swimmer.
