## Identity & Lore
Starmie (Pokedex #121) is the Mysterious Pokémon, an enigmatic Water/Psychic-type entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Resembling an abstract, violet star formed by two interlocked pentagrams, it features a central red core that glows with the seven colors of the rainbow. While its habitat is technically the sea, Starmie acts with a geometric precision that leads many researchers to theorize it may have extraterrestrial origins or communicate with the stars using radio waves emitted from its core. This core, treasured by some as a rare gem, serves as the creature's heart and can regenerate lost limbs if damaged.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 75, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 85, Speed 115.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Utility Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** Starmie possesses a defensive profile that **resists Fire, Water, Ice, Fighting, Psychic, and Steel** moves. However, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, Dark, Grass, and Electric** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and Special Attack, Starmie is famous for its "BoltBeam" coverage and utility. Key moves include **Hydro Pump** (high-power STAB), **Psychic** (reliable STAB), **Ice Beam** (crucial coverage against Grass and Dragon types), and **Thunderbolt** (coverage against flying/water types). It often utilizes **Rapid Spin** to clear hazards or **Recover** for longevity.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Illuminate:** Raises the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon (mostly non-combat utility).
    *   **Natural Cure:** Heals all status conditions (like paralysis or poison) upon switching out, making it an excellent pivot.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last; while Starmie is fast, this punishes opponents who switch into it.

## Evolution & Biology
Starmie is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Staryu** immediately when exposed to a **Water Stone**. As a genderless species, it belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group. Biologically, Starmie relies entirely on its core; as long as the center remains glowing and intact, the Pokémon can recover from severe physical damage.
