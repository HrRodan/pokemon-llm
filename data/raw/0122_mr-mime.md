## Identity & Lore
Mr. Mime (Pokedex #122) is the humanoid Barrier Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its pantomiming ability, this Psychic/Fairy-type creates invisible walls by vibrating its fingertips at high speeds to solidify air particles. While primarily found in urban settings, it is extremely protective of its performance; according to lore, it will aggressively slap anyone who interrupts its act with its broad hands. Though this profile details the standard Kantonian form, a regional **Galarian Form** (Ice/Psychic) exists which specializes in tap dancing rather than pantomime.

## Evolution & Biology
Mr. Mime is the second stage of a two-stage evolutionary line (three in the Galar region). It evolves from **Mime Jr.** when leveled up while knowing the move **Mimic**. It belongs to the **Human-Like** Egg Group. While the standard Kantonian Mr. Mime does not evolve further, the regional Galarian Mr. Mime is capable of evolving into **Mr. Rime** at Level 42.
