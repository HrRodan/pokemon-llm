## Identity & Lore
Raikou (Pokedex #243) is the Legendary **Thunder Pokémon**, first discovered in the **Johto** region (Generation II). A member of the Legendary Beasts trio alongside Entei and Suicune, Raikou is said to have been resurrected by Ho-Oh after the burning of the Brass Tower, specifically representing the lightning bolt that struck the tower. This yellow, quadrupedal beast carries rain clouds on its back, allowing it to fire thunderbolts at will regardless of the weather. While it typically roams grasslands, its roar is known to send shockwaves through the air like crashing thunder. In the Paldea region's Area Zero, an ancient Paradox form resembling Raikou, known as **Raging Bolt**, has been documented.

* **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** The Pokémon exerts a heavy presence, causing opposing Pokémon to use 2 PP for every move instead of 1.
    *   **Inner Focus (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from flinching and prevents its stats from being lowered by the Intimidate ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Raikou is a **non-evolving Legendary Pokémon** and does not belong to any evolutionary chain. It is a standalone entity within the "No Eggs" (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it cannot breed. In Pokémon lore, it does not evolve from a pre-evolution but was created directly by the Rainbow Pokémon, Ho-Oh.
