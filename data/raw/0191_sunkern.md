## Identity & Lore
Sunkern (Pokedex #191) is the Seed Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). This yellow, grassland-dwelling creature is historically significant for possessing one of the lowest Base Stat Totals of all Pokémon, making it exceptionally vulnerable in the wild. To ensure survival, Sunkern minimizes movement to conserve the nutrients stored within its body for evolution, surviving primarily on morning dew. It is famously timid; Pokedex entries note that it may drop from the sky suddenly and, if attacked by predators like Spearow, will desperately shake its leaves to deter them. While it has no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is defined by its potential to flourish under harsh sunlight.

## Evolution & Biology
Sunkern is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Sunflora** when exposed to a **Sun Stone**. Unlike many Pokémon that evolve via leveling, Sunkern requires this specific evolutionary stone to unlock its potential. It belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and has a medium-slow growth rate.
