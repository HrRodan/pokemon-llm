## Identity & Lore
Sneasel (Pokédex #215) is the Sharp Claw Pokémon, a cunning Dark/Ice-type predator originally discovered in the **Johto** region (Generation II). Residing primarily in cold **forests** and mountainous areas, this creature is characterized by its sleek black fur (or teal in its Shiny coloration) and a single red ear feather. Sneasel is notorious for its deceptive hunting tactics; it works in pairs where one distracts parents while the other steals eggs from nests using its retractable, hook-like claws. While this specific profile details the standard Johto variant, Sneasel possesses a distinct regional variant known as **Hisuian Sneasel** (Fighting/Poison-type) found in the ancient Sinnoh region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 95, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 75, Speed 115.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dark/Ice type, Sneasel has a precarious defensive profile. It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting-type** moves. It is also weak to Rock, Steel, Fire, Bug, and Fairy types. However, it resists Ghost, Dark, and Ice types, and possesses a complete **immunity to Psychic-type** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** capitalizing on its high Speed and Attack stats, Sneasel functions best with physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and priority moves. Key moves include **Triple Axel** (or Icicle Crash) for massive Ice damage, **Knock Off** for Dark-type utility and damage, **Ice Shard** to strike first regardless of speed, and **Swords Dance** to sharply boost its Attack stat.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Inner Focus:** Prevents the Pokémon from flinching, making it immune to moves like Fake Out.
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its accuracy.
    *   **Pickpocket (Hidden Ability):** Allows Sneasel to steal the attacker's held item upon making physical contact.

## Evolution & Biology
Sneasel is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Weavile** when leveled up at **night** while holding a **Razor Claw**. While the provided data references *Sneasler*, it is important to note that only the Hisuian form of Sneasel evolves into Sneasler (exposed to a Razor Claw during the day); the standard Johto Sneasel described here strictly evolves into Weavile. Sneasel belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group and takes approximately 5,120 steps to hatch. Its retractable claws are its primary tool for both combat and climbing trees to ambush prey.
