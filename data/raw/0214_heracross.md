## Identity & Lore
Heracross (Pokedex #214) is the Single Horn Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Fighting creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in deep forests, this blue, humanoid beetle is defined by the massive, pronged horn on its forehead. While generally docile and content to sip honey from trees, Heracross possesses immense physical strength and becomes highly aggressive if disturbed while feeding. It is capable of toppling massive trees or hurling foes with its horn. Although it does not have a standard evolution, Heracross is capable of Mega Evolution, transforming into **Mega Heracross** using Heracronite, which drastically increases its bulk and raw power.

## Evolution & Biology
Heracross is a standalone species and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 25 cycles. While it does not evolve by level, it is notable for its rivalry with Pinsir, another stag-beetle-inspired Pokémon often found in similar habitats.
