## Identity & Lore
Mewtwo (Pokedex #150) is the Genetic Pokémon, a Legendary Psychic-type introduced in Generation I (Kanto). It was created by a scientist after years of horrific gene splicing and DNA engineering experiments based on the genetic code of the Mythical Pokémon Mew. Characterized by its upright, humanoid shape and purple tail, Mewtwo is often depicted as vicious and devoid of compassion, reflected in its base happiness of zero. While primarily solitary, often seeking refuge in locations like the Cerulean Cave, it possesses immense latent power. Although the provided data lists a single form, World Knowledge confirms that Mewtwo is capable of two distinct Mega Evolutions: **Mega Mewtwo X** (gaining the Fighting type) and **Mega Mewtwo Y** (enhancing its psionic capabilities), triggered by the Mewtwonite X and Y stones, respectively.

## Evolution & Biology
Mewtwo is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. Unlike natural organisms, it is the product of cloning. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot breed. Its growth rate is classified as slow, requiring significant experience to reach its level cap.
