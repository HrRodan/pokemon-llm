## Identity & Lore
Ursaring (Pokedex #217) is the Hibernator Pokémon, a massive Normal-type creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in **mountain** habitats, this formidable bear is distinguished by the yellow ring mark on its chest and its immense physical strength. While it is a capable climber, Ursaring prefers to use its powerful forelegs to snap trees entirely to access fallen **Berries** rather than climbing for them. It is known for its grumpy and territorial demeanor, often marking its territory with claw marks on trees. In the ancient Hisui region, this species was known to evolve further into a formidable ground-dwelling form.

    *   **Unnerve:** Unnerves opposing Pokémon and makes them unable to eat Berries.

## Evolution & Biology
Ursaring is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Teddiursa** starting at **Level 30**. In the modern era, Ursaring is typically the final stage; however, in the Hisui region (and via specific methods), it is capable of evolving into **Ursaluna**. This rare evolution is triggered when Ursaring is exposed to a **Peat Block** specifically during a **Full Moon**. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group.
