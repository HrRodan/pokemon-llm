## Identity & Lore
Forretress (Pokedex #205) is the Bagworm Pokémon, a resilient Bug/Steel-type defensive specialist introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in forests, this Pokémon is perpetually encased in a heavy, steel-hard shell that provides impenetrable protection. While it typically remains stationary attached to tree trunks, Forretress is capable of shooting out pieces of its shell to attack opponents. The true appearance of the creature inside its armor remains a total mystery to researchers, as the shell opens only for a split second when catching prey or expelling heat. Unlike many other Bug-types, it does not have any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 90, Defense 140, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 60, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wall / Hazard Setter / Spinner.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Bug/Steel type, it possesses a distinct defensive profile. It suffers from a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire** type moves. However, it boasts an impressive array of resistances, including Normal, Grass, Ice, Psychic, Bug, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy, along with a complete **Immunity to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Defense and abysmal Speed, Forretress functions best with utility and defense-scaling moves. Key selections include **Spikes** (or Toxic Spikes/Stealth Rock) for entry hazard stacking, **Rapid Spin** to clear hazards from its own side, **Gyro Ball** to deal massive damage based on its low Speed, and **Body Press** to utilize its high Defense stat for offense. **Explosion** is also a signature option for a final burst of damage.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, ensuring it can almost always set up at least one layer of hazards.
    *   **Overcoat (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from weather damage (like Sandstorm) and powder moves (like Spore or Sleep Powder).

## Evolution & Biology
Forretress is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pineco** starting at **Level 31**. While Pineco is a pure Bug-type known for exploding, Forretress gains the Steel typing upon evolution, significantly hardening its exterior. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
