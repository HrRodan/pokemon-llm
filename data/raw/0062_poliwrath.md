## Identity & Lore
Poliwrath (Pokédex #062) is the Tadpole Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Fighting creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). A significant physical evolution from its predecessors, Poliwrath possesses a bulky, muscular blue physique while retaining the signature hypnotic spiral pattern on its white belly. Unlike its tadpole pre-evolutions, Poliwrath has developed distinct arms and legs, transitioning into a humanoid shape adapted for both land and sea. Lore describes it as a tireless swimmer with near-infinite stamina, capable of crossing the Pacific Ocean using a front crawl or breaststroke that easily overtakes the best human swimmers. It is often found inhabiting the water's edge, where it utilizes its powerful muscles for both aquatic traversal and physical combat.

## Evolution & Biology
Poliwrath is the final stage of a split 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Poliwhirl** when exposed to a **Water Stone**. It is the final evolutionary form of **Poliwag**. Unlike a standard linear chain, Poliwhirl has an alternate evolution; if traded while holding a King's Rock, it evolves into Politoed instead. Poliwrath belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group.
