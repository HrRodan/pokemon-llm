## Identity & Lore
Dugtrio (Pokédex #051) is the Mole Pokémon, a Ground-type entity first discovered in Generation I (Kanto). This unique creature consists of a team of Diglett triplets sharing a single body, renowned for its incredible burrowing capabilities. Dugtrio can tunnel through the earth at depths of up to 60 miles, triggering massive tremors and earthquakes as it moves. While primarily found in caves, its biology allows it to coordinate the thoughts of all three heads to act with surprising speed. While this profile details the standard form, Dugtrio possesses a notable regional variant known as **Alolan Dugtrio**, which gains the Steel type and distinctive golden hair.

Biologically, the three heads move alternately to loosen the soil, allowing for rapid movement through the earth. It belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group and requires a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles.
