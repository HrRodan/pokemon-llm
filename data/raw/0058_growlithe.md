## Identity & Lore
Growlithe (Pokedex #058) is the loyal Puppy Pokémon, a pure Fire-type originating from Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its brave and trustworthy nature, this brown, quadrupedal canine is fiercely protective of its territory, often barking and biting to repel intruders from its space. While typically found inhabiting grasslands, Growlithe shares a deep history of cooperation with humans, famously serving alongside Officer Jenny in law enforcement lore. While the standard form is pure Fire, a regional variant exists in the ancient Hisui region (Hisuian Growlithe), which adopts a dual Fire/Rock typing and a thicker coat of fur.
