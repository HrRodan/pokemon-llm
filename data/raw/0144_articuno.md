## Identity & Lore
Articuno (Pokedex #144) is the legendary Freeze Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). A member of the Kanto Legendary Bird trio alongside Zapdos and Moltres, Articuno is revered for its ability to control moisture in the air, freezing it instantly to generate snow while it flies. This large avian Pokémon possesses a magnificent set of wings made of ice and a long, streaming tail that trails behind it like a ribbon. According to folklore, it appears before doomed travelers lost in icy mountains to guide them. It is traditionally associated with the Seafoam Islands, where it nests in isolation. While primarily known for its Kantonian form, Articuno possesses a psychic-type regional variant found in the Galar region, though this profile focuses on its original Ice/Flying physiology.

## Evolution & Biology
Articuno is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon. As a Legendary species, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group and cannot breed. In the wild, it is typically encountered as a unique, static interaction in deep caverns or frozen peaks.
