## Identity & Lore
Bellsprout (Pokedex #069) is the Flower Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Poison creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its thin, flexible stem and yellow, bell-shaped head, this carnivorous Pokémon inhabits temperate forests where it actively hunts small insects. Its body is surprisingly agile; Bellsprout can bend and sway to avoid attacks, utilizing its stem's flexibility to mimic human-like movements. While it can uproot itself to move, it must frequently plant its root-like feet into the ground to absorb moisture and nutrients from the soil. Although it appears frail, its predatory nature makes it aggressive when threatened.

## Evolution & Biology
Bellsprout is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the **Plant** egg group. It evolves into **Weepinbell** starting at **Level 21**. The final stage, **Victreebel**, is achieved only when Weepinbell is exposed to a **Leaf Stone**. This evolutionary line is known for becoming increasingly stationary and reliant on ambush tactics as it matures.
