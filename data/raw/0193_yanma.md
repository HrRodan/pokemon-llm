## Identity & Lore
Yanma (Pokedex #193) is the Clear Wing Pokémon, a large insectoid creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Distinguished by its vibrant red coloration and sleek, dragonfly-like physiology, Yanma resides primarily in forest habitats where it patrols its territory. According to ecological lore, its wings are capable of flapping at high speeds to generate powerful shock waves, which it uses to shatter glass or disturb prey. Its massive eyes provide 360-degree vision, allowing it to spot predators and food from all angles without turning its head. While it is often overshadowed by later generations, it serves as the biological precursor to the formidable, prehistoric-themed Yanmega.

## Evolution & Biology
