## Identity & Lore
Grimer (Pokedex #088) is the amorphous Sludge Pokémon, originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This **Poison-type** entity possesses a fluid, purple body made entirely of toxic sludge, allowing it to slip through narrow openings and enter sewer pipes easily. According to biological reports, Grimer appears in filthy areas and thrives by sucking up polluted sludge pumped out of factories; as it moves, it leaves behind germs that prevent new plant life from growing. While this profile details the standard form found in urban habitats, Grimer notably possesses a regional variant, **Alolan Grimer**, which gained the Dark type due to a diet of garbage in the Alola region.

## Combat Profile
