## Identity & Lore
Weepinbell (Pokedex #070) is known as the Flycatcher Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Poison creature native to the forests of **Generation I (Kanto)**. Resembling a carnivorous pitcher plant, this Pokémon possesses a yellow, bell-shaped body with lateral leaves that function as cutters. Biologically, Weepinbell utilizes a hook-like appendage on its rear to anchor itself to tree branches while sleeping to avoid slipping. It is an ambush predator; as described in its bio, it spits **Poison Powder** to immobilize prey before dissolving them with strong acid. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the intermediate stage of a classic Kanto evolutionary line.
