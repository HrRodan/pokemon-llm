## Identity & Lore
Lanturn (Pokedex #171) is the dual-type Water/Electric **Light Pokémon** introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Residing in the deep ocean, this blue, anglerfish-inspired creature is famous for the bioluminescent globes attached to its dorsal fin. Its internal light is incredibly intense; lore states that the light it emits is so bright it can illuminate the sea's surface from a depth of over three miles, earning it the nickname "The Deep-Sea Star." Lanturn uses this light to lure prey before swallowing them whole. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its unique typing makes it a distinct entity in the aquatic ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 125, Attack 58, Defense 58, Sp. Atk 76, Sp. Def 76, Speed 67.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Pivot / Cleric.
*   **Type Matchups:** Without ability intervention, it is **weak to Ground and Grass**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, Flying, and Steel** types. Uniquely, its typing leaves it neutral to Electric attacks naturally, but its ability often converts this into an immunity.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high HP and decent Special Attack, key moves include **Scald** (for STAB and burn chance), **Volt Switch** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups), **Ice Beam** (to cover Grass and Ground weaknesses), and **Thunder Wave** (for speed control). It also has access to utility moves like **Heal Bell** and **Stockpile**.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Volt Absorb:** Restores HP if hit by an Electric-type move, granting immunity to one of its primary weaknesses.
    *   **Illuminate:** Increases the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon (primarily non-combat utility).
    *   **Water Absorb (Hidden):** Restores HP if hit by a Water-type move, granting water immunity.

## Evolution & Biology
Lanturn is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Chinchou** starting at **Level 27**. Unlike its pre-evolution which crawls on the sea floor, Lanturn is a strong swimmer. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group. Its massive health pool is reflective of its adaptation to the high-pressure environment of the deep sea.
