## Identity & Lore
Tauros (Pokedex #128) is the Wild Bull Pokémon, a fearsome bovine initially discovered in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Characterized by its brown coat, three tails, and metallic nodes on its forehead, Tauros is a creature of immense stamina and aggression. As described in its biology, when targeting an enemy, it charges furiously while whipping its body with its long tails to work itself into a frenzy. It is primarily found roaming in herds across vast **grasslands**. While the standard Tauros is a Normal-type, World Knowledge notes the existence of three distinct **Paldean Forms** (Combat Breed, Blaze Breed, and Aqua Breed) discovered in Generation IX, which alter its typing and appearance significantly. Tauros acts as the male counterpart to the Miltank species.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 100, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 70, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker / Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Normal-type**, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**. It takes neutral damage from all other types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and Attack, along with its ability to ignore secondary effects for damage, key moves include **Body Slam** (STAB), **Earthquake** (coverage against Rock/Steel), **Close Combat** (high-power coverage), and its signature move **Raging Bull** (which breaks barriers like Light Screen).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Intimidate:** Lowers the opposing Pokémon's Attack stat upon entering battle, providing excellent physical bulk utility.
    *   **Anger Point:** If Tauros is hit by a critical hit, its Attack stat is maximized immediately.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden Ability):** Removes additional effects from attacking moves (like Body Slam's paralysis chance) to increase the move's damage output significantly.

## Evolution & Biology
Tauros is a **single-stage Pokémon** and does not evolve from or into any other form. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group. As a **100% male species**, Tauros cannot produce Tauros eggs directly when bred with Miltank; it must be bred with a Ditto to reproduce its own species. Its growth rate is classified as slow, requiring significant experience to reach level 100.
