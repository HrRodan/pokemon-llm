## Identity & Lore
Ampharos (Pokedex #181) is the Light Pokémon, a yellow, bipedal electric creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Unlike its pre-evolutions, Ampharos has shed its wool entirely, relying instead on the red orb at the tip of its tail which shines so brightly it can be seen from space. This tail acts as a beacon for lost people, leading to its historical association with lighthouses, such as the famous Glitter Lighthouse in Olivine City. While normally pure Electric-type, Ampharos is capable of performing **Mega Evolution** using the Ampharosite, transforming into **Mega Ampharos**, gaining the Dragon type and the Mold Breaker ability while growing a magnificent mane of white wool. It inhabits grasslands and uses its light to signal companions over long distances.

It also has access to **Cotton Guard**, drastically raising its Defense.

    *   **Plus (Hidden):** Boosts the Pokémon's Special Attack if an active ally has the Plus or Minus ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Ampharos is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Flaaffy** starting at **level 30**, which evolves from **Mareep** starting at **level 15**. Unlike its woolen pre-evolutions, Ampharos has smooth, rubbery skin that prevents electric shocks. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Field** (listed as "ground" in data) Egg Groups. The light from its tail is generated by chemical reactions within its body, and the brightness intensity matches its emotional state.
