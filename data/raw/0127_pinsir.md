## Identity & Lore
Pinsir (Pokedex #127) is the formidable **Stag Beetle Pokémon**, a pure Bug-type introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This brown, humanoid insect is defined by the massive, spiked pincers on top of its head, which it uses to crush prey with devastating force. According to ecological research, if Pinsir fails to crush a victim immediately, it will violently swing the target around and toss it away. It is primarily found in deep **forests**, where it hides in tree sap, though it is known to become sluggish in cold environments due to its ectothermic nature. While the standard data strictly categorizes it as a single-stage Pokémon, World Knowledge confirms that Pinsir is capable of **Mega Evolution**; when holding Pinsirite, it transforms into **Mega Pinsir**, gaining the Flying type and the Aerilate ability.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 125, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 70, Speed 85.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Bug-type, it is **weak to Fire, Flying, and Rock**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, and Grass** moves.
* **Move Selection:** capitalizing on its massive Attack stat (125), Pinsir functions best with **Swords Dance** to boost its power further, paired with **X-Scissor** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). Essential coverage moves include **Earthquake** and **Close Combat** (or **Stone Edge**) to handle Rock and Steel types that resist its Bug attacks. **Quick Attack** is also viable for priority execution.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Hyper Cutter:** Prevents the Pokémon's Attack stat from being lowered by opponent abilities or moves (e.g., Intimidate).
    *   **Mold Breaker:** Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities (e.g., hitting a Levitate user with Earthquake).
    *   **Moxie (Hidden Ability):** Boosts the Attack stat by one stage after knocking out any Pokémon, making it a dangerous snowballing threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Pinsir is a stand-alone Pokémon that belongs to a **single-stage evolutionary line**; it does not evolve from or into any other standard Pokémon. However, it serves as a counterpart to Scyther in the Kanto region. Pinsir belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and possesses a hatch counter of 25. While it does not undergo traditional metamorphosis, its high physical defense suggests a hardened exoskeleton developed for trench warfare in its forest habitats.
