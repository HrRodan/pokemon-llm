## Identity & Lore
Rattata (Pokedex #019) is the Mouse Pokémon, a ubiquitous sight originally discovered in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Characterized by its small size, purple fur, and large incisors, this quadrupedal Pokémon is notorious for its survival instincts and ability to colonize almost any habitat, though it prefers grasslands. Rattata possesses an extremely fast metabolism and sharp senses; its flavor text notes that it "bites anything when it attacks" and is quick enough to elusive predators. While this profile focuses on the Kantonian form, Rattata has a significant regional variant, **Alolan Rattata**, which adapts a Dark/Normal typing and a mustache-like appearance to survive urban environments.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 56, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 35, Speed 72.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal type, it is **weak to Fighting** and holds a unique **immunity to Ghost** type moves. It possesses no specific resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and decent Attack, Rattata's most effective kit includes **Hyper Fang** (reliable STAB), **Sucker Punch** (priority coverage against Ghosts), **U-turn** (for pivoting out of danger), and **Endeavor** (a tactical move often used in the "F.E.A.R." strategy to equalize HP).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Run Away:** Ensures escape from wild battles, highlighting its skittish nature.
    *   **Guts:** Increases Attack by 50% when afflicted by a status condition (Burn, Paralyze, Poison), making it dangerous when debuffed.
    *   **Hustle (Hidden):** Boosts Attack by 50% but lowers physical move accuracy by 20%, offering high-risk, high-reward power.

## Evolution & Biology
Rattata is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Raticate** starting at **Level 20**. While the standard Kantonian Rattata evolves purely based on level, its Alolan counterpart requires leveling up at night. Rattata belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and reproduces quickly. Its teeth grow continuously, forcing it to gnaw on hard objects like logs or rocks to file them down.
