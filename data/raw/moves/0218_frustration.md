## Identity & Mechanics
**Frustration** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user taps into its deep-seated resentment and lack of loyalty toward its Trainer to deliver a punishing blow. The less the Pokémon likes its Trainer, the more power it puts into this spiteful lashing. Visually, it represents a violent outburst of negative emotion, manifesting as a raw, physical strike fueled by a fractured bond.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The move's base power is dynamic, scaling inversely with the user's Happiness (Friendship) stat. The formula used is `(255 - Happiness) * 2 / 5`. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. The power peaks at **102** (at 0 Happiness) and bottoms out at **1** (at 255 Happiness).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Frustration is the mechanical twin to the move *Return*. At maximum power (102), it is one of the strongest and most reliable physical Normal-type moves in the game. In competitive play, it was often used as a **"Ditto-check."** Since most competitive players naturally max out their Pokémon's happiness, a Ditto transforming into a Pokémon with Frustration would deal negligible damage (Power 1) because the Ditto itself usually has max happiness. It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a nearly universal distribution (**942** learners), as almost every Pokémon capable of learning TMs could learn Frustration until its removal in Generation VIII.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically essential for Physical Normal-type threats like **Snorlax**, **Mega Lopunny**, and **Mega Kangaskhan** to achieve high-damage STAB output. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on powerful physical attackers such as **Salamence**, **Tyranitar**, and **Tauros** in earlier generations to provide reliable neutral coverage against opponents that do not resist Normal-type attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM21** in Generations II through VII. It was notably removed from the move pool in Pokémon Sword & Shield, making it unavailable in modern competitive formats.
