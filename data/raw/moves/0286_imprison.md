## Identity & Mechanics
**Imprison** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user weaves a complex psychic seal around the battlefield, projecting its own knowledge of techniques to mentally block its opponents. By creating this restrictive field, the user forbids any foe from executing a move that the user also possesses. This "mental lock" remains active as long as the user stays on the field, effectively censoring the opponent's movepool.
* **Effect:** Prevents any Pokémon on the opposing side from using any move that is also known by the user. This is a dynamic or "live" effect; if the user transforms or acquires new moves while active, those new moves are immediately restricted for the opponent. If the opponent shares no moves with the user at the time of activation, the move fails.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Status move).
* **Targeting:** Affects all opponents (Field effect centered on the user).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Meta Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Imprison is a specialized tactical tool, primarily dominant in **VGC (Doubles)** formats. Its most common application is "Imprison-Room," where a Pokémon carries both Imprison and **Trick Room** to prevent the opponent from setting up speed control. It is also used to seal **Protect**, arguably the most common move in doubles, leaving opponents vulnerable to focus fire. While it lacks direct damage, it acts as a hard counter to mirror matches and specific archetype leads.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails if the user is the only Pokémon on the field or if no move overlap exists.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (183 learners), primarily found among Psychic and Ghost-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Flutter Mane**, **Farigiraf**, and **Gengar**. **Mew** is a particularly dangerous user due to its ability to learn every TM, allowing it to "seal" almost any move in the game.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Chandelure** or **Landorus-Therian** in high-level competitive play to shut down opposing **Protect**, **Substitute**, or **Tailwind** users. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), making it a flexible tech choice for many team compositions.
