## Identity & Mechanics
**Horn Leech** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user stabs or impales the target with its horns, antlers, or thorns to siphon away their life force. This move combines offensive pressure with vampiric restorative properties, channeling the stolen energy to revitalize the user’s body. It is the physical counterpart to Giga Drain.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and heals the user for 50% of the damage dealt.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (restoration is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Sustainability STAB / Offensive Recovery.
* **Usage:** Horn Leech is a premier choice for Physical Grass-type attackers who prioritize longevity over raw power. While it lacks the sheer wallbreaking force of *Wood Hammer* (120 Power), it is often preferred because it negates recoil and provides "passive-aggressive" recovery. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. It is not a punching or sound-based move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (11 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with prominent horns or arboreal features.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by the Legendary Pokémon **Xerneas** and **Tapu Bulu** (the latter of which benefits immensely from Grassy Terrain boosting the move's power). It is also a signature tool for **Ogerpon** (all forms), providing the Teal Mask Pokémon with vital staying power.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used purely for coverage due to its limited distribution, **Sawsbuck** and **Gogoat** rely on it as their primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move to offset their naturally lower defensive stats through constant healing.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is strictly via level-up or inherent movepools; it is notably **absent from most TM/TR lists**, making it a rare and valuable commodity for the few Pokémon that possess it.
