## Identity & Mechanics
**Spore** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user scatters a cloud of concentrated, sleep-inducing fungal spores at the target, plunging them into a deep slumber. As the only sleep-inducing move with perfect accuracy, it is the most feared status-inflicting move in the competitive circuit, capable of completely neutralizing an opponent for several turns.
* **Effect:** Puts the target to sleep.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% effect rate).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Elite Status Support / Incapacitator.
* **Usage:** Spore is the "Gold Standard" of sleep moves, vastly outclassing Sleep Powder (75% accuracy) and Hypnosis (60% accuracy). It is used to force switches, generate free turns for setup, or shut down a dangerous sweeper. It deals **Super Effective** damage to nothing (status move), but its utility is universal except against **Grass-type** Pokémon, those with the **Overcoat** ability, or targets holding **Safety Goggles**, all of which are immune to powder-based moves as of Generation VI.
* **Attributes:** Powder-based move. Does not affect Grass-types. Blocked by Magic Coat and Magic Bounce.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution (11 learners), restricted almost exclusively to fungal or mushroom-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Amoonguss:** A premier VGC support Pokémon that uses Spore alongside *Regenerator* to repeatedly incapacitate threats.
    * **Breloom:** A dangerous physical attacker that uses Spore to create an opening for *Swords Dance* or to safely land heavy hits with *Technician*-boosted moves.
    * **Brute Bonnet:** A Paradox Pokémon that utilizes Spore in Trick Room or Sun teams to disrupt opposing cores.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme power, it is rarely given to non-Grass types. **Toedscruel** is a unique user whose ability *Mycelium Might* allows it to hit through abilities like *Good as Gold* (Gholdengo), albeit at decreased priority.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely rare; it is never available via **TM/TR** and must be learned via level-up or as an Egg Move in specific evolutionary lines.
