## Identity & Mechanics
**Bullet Punch** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user delivers a high-speed strike with a fist as hard as tempered steel. Executed with the velocity of a projectile, the sheer momentum allows the user to preempt the opponent's actions, making it a reliable tool for finishing off faster, weakened targets.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a priority of +1, allowing it to strike before most other moves regardless of the user's Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0%).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Priority Revenge Killer / Cleaner.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Bullet Punch is a cornerstone of competitive play due to its **+1 Priority**. It is the primary tool for bypassing the high Speed tiers of "Glass Cannon" threats. It is notably terrifying when paired with the **Technician** ability, which boosts its power by 50%. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning it receives a 20% power boost from the **Iron Fist** ability and is blocked by the Rocky Helmet item or Rough Skin ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (18 total learners), primarily concentrated among Steel and Fighting-type Pokémon with capable fists.
* **Prominent Users:** It is most iconically utilized by **Scizor** (where Technician-boosted STAB makes it a Tier-defining threat), **Metagross**, and **Lucario**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Fighting-types like **Machamp** and **Hitmonchan** to provide a specialized priority option to check faster Fairy-type threats that would otherwise outspeed and KO them.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is limited; it is rarely available as a TM/TR and is typically learned via Level-up or as a specialized Egg Move (e.g., for Riolu or Machop).
