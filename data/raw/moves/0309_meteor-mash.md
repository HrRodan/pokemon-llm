## Identity & Mechanics
**Meteor Mash** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user delivers a devastating punch with the force and speed of a falling meteor. This cosmic-themed physical strike involves the user hardening its fist to a metallic density before slamming into the target, often accompanied by a flash of starlight or a cratering impact. It is one of the most powerful Steel-type physical attacks available.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20% chance** to raise the user’s **Attack** stat by one stage (+1), allowing the user to "snowball" and become increasingly dangerous during a sweep.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Physical Sweeper Utility.**
* **Usage:** Meteor Mash serves as a high-reward STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. While it lacks the perfect accuracy of *Iron Head*, its higher base power and the potential Attack boost make it superior for breaking through bulky defensive cores. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types, making it a premier tool for checking prominent Fairy-type "walls."
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching move**, meaning its power is further amplified by the ability *Iron Fist*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (only 9 learners), often associated with Pokémon tied to cosmic themes or metallic physiology.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature offensive tool for **Metagross** (and its Mega Evolution), and is frequently run on **Jirachi** and **Lucario**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by **Clefable** (though Clefable often favors Special sets, it has access to this for niche Physical or Mixed sets) and **Pikachu Rock Star** in specific formats.
* **Acquisition:** Highly exclusive; it is generally not available as a TM or TR, requiring specific level-up paths or event distributions, which limits its presence in the competitive meta to a select group of elite physical attackers.
