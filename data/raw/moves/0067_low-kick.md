## Identity & Mechanics
**Low Kick** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user targets the opponent's feet or lower anatomy, tripping them to use their own momentum against them. The force of the impact is determined by the target's mass; the heavier the opponent, the more devastating the damage as they crash to the ground. This makes it a specialized tool for taking down massive, hulking threats that would otherwise resist standard physical strikes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The base power is variable, scaling upward based on the target's weight in kilograms. It reaches a maximum power of 120 against targets weighing more than 200kg (440.9 lbs).
* **Power Scaling:** 
    * <10kg: 20 Power
    * 10kg–25kg: 40 Power
    * 25kg–50kg: 60 Power
    * 50kg–100kg: 80 Power
    * 100kg–200kg: 100 Power
    * \>200kg: 120 Power
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Note: In Generation I, it had a 30% flinch chance, but this was replaced by the weight-scaling mechanic in Generation II).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Variable Power Nuke / Anti-Heavyweight Tech.
* **Usage:** Low Kick is a high-utility alternative to *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick*. Its primary advantage is that it lacks the defensive drawbacks (stat drops or crash damage) of other high-power Fighting moves. It is particularly effective in tiers dominated by Heavyweight Legendaries (like Groudon or Dialga) and Steel-type walls (like Aggron or Ferrothorn). However, it is highly inconsistent against "Light" threats like *Flutter Mane* or *Maushold*, where its power drops significantly.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Static*.
