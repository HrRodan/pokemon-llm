## Identity & Mechanics
**Secret Power** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user draws upon the latent energy of the surrounding environment to strike the opponent. This move is characterized by its extreme versatility, manifesting different secondary effects depending on the battlefield's terrain, such as emitting calming spores in tall grass or generating static electricity in urban settings.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a 30% chance to trigger a specific secondary effect based on the current terrain (e.g., Sleep in tall grass, Paralysis in buildings, Flinch in caves, or Accuracy reduction in deserts).
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to induce a status condition or stat drop (Sleep, Paralysis, Flinch, Freeze, Attack drop, or Accuracy drop).
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility Attacker / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** While its raw power is lower than **Return** or **Body Slam**, Secret Power is favored in specific competitive niches for its high 30% secondary effect rate. In earlier generations, it served as a "safer" status-spreading move when the terrain was predictable. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, as it is a Normal-type move, but provides neutral coverage against most of the Pokédex, excluding Rock and Steel types.
* **Attributes:** This move is notable for being a non-contact physical attack in most generations, allowing the user to bypass punishing abilities like **Rough Skin**, **Iron Barbs**, or **Rocky Helmet**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **massive** distribution (792 learners), as it was a near-universal TM (TM43 in Gen 3/4; TM94 in Gen 6).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Kangaskhan**, **Miltank**, and **Blissey**, who can utilize the 30% status chance to wear down opponents.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its universal TM status, it is found on diverse threats like **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, and **Mew**. These Pokémon occasionally carry it in restricted formats to fish for status effects (like Sleep in Grassy Terrain) without making contact.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a TM in Generations III, IV, and VI. It is also famously required in the Hoenn region to create **Secret Bases** in trees and bushes.
