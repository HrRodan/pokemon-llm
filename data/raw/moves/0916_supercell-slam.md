**## Identity & Mechanics**
**Supercell Slam** is a physical Electric-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user saturates its entire body with high-voltage electricity and drops onto the target with crushing force, mimicking a localized atmospheric supercell. This high-velocity impact generates immense power but carries significant risk; if the user fails to connect with the target, the uncontrolled momentum causes it to crash and sustain massive damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. If the move misses, is blocked by a protection move, or fails due to an immunity (such as a Ground-type switch-in), the user takes **crash damage** equal to 50% of its maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure damage with recoil risk).
* **Targeting:** Single target.

**## Competitive Profile**
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Physical STAB / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Supercell Slam serves as the "High Jump Kick" of Electric-type moves. It provides Physical Electric-type attackers with a much-needed high-power alternative to **Wild Charge** (which has mandatory recoil) and **Thunder Punch** (which lacks sufficient power). While the 95% accuracy is generally reliable, it is extremely risky to use if the opponent has a **Ground-type** or a Pokémon with **Volt Absorb/Lightning Rod** on their bench, as a predicted switch will cause the user to lose half its health. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact** and is boosted by abilities like **Tough Claws** or **Iron Fist** (if categorized as a punch, though it is generally classified as a body-slam/drop).

**## Distribution & Notable Users**
It has a moderate distribution (47 learners), primarily given to Physical attackers who previously lacked strong Electric options.
* **Prominent Users:** Extensively utilized by **Iron Hands**, **Zekrom**, **Electivire**, and **Luxray**. It is also a significant addition to **Zapdos** and **Pawmot**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy-hitting non-Electric Pokémon like **Great Tusk**, **Ursaluna**, and **Snorlax** to provide crucial coverage against bulky Water-types and Flying-type switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM210** in the Paldea region (Indigo Disk DLC), making it a staple coverage option for a variety of Physical bruisers.
