## Identity & Mechanics
**Extreme Evoboost** is a Status Normal-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** Drawing upon the concentrated Z-Power of the Eevium Z crystal, Eevee summons the spectral energy of all eight of its possible evolutions—Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon, Espeon, Umbreon, Leafeon, Glaceon, and Sylveon. This influx of elemental power surrounds the user in a rainbow aura, drastically enhancing its physical and mystical capabilities.
* **Effect:** This move functions as an "Omni-boost," raising the user’s Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats by two stages (+2) each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply all stat boosts upon successful execution.
* **Targeting:** Affects the User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** Ultimate Setup / Win Condition.
* **Usage:** Extreme Evoboost is one of the most powerful setup moves in Pokémon history, effectively doubling the user's offensive and defensive presence in a single turn. In competitive formats where permitted (such as Smogon's NatDex or Generation VII tiers), it is almost exclusively paired with **Baton Pass** to transfer these massive stat boosts to a more powerful teammate, or used alongside **Stored Power**, which reaches a massive base power after the move is used. It deals no damage directly but facilitates a sweep by turning a fragile Pokémon into a statistical juggernaut. 
* **Attributes:** Requires the held item **Eevium Z** and the base move **Last Resort**. As a Z-Move, it cannot be Taunted or redirected easily, though it can only be used once per battle.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner), as it is a Signature Z-Move.
* **Prominent Users:** This move is exclusive to **Eevee**. While Eevee itself has low base stats, the +2 boost to all categories allows it to survive hits and potentially sweep or pivot.
* **Coverage Utility:** While only Eevee can cast the move, it is designed to support an entire team. In the "Eevee-Pass" archetype, it is used to support high-value targets like **Espeon** (who prevents Haze/Roar via Magic Bounce) or **Necrozma-Ultra** (to create an unkillable sweeper).
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Eevium Z** crystal, obtained after completing the Eevium Z quest at the Thrifty Megamart on Akala Island.
