## Identity & Mechanics
**Bloom Doom (Special)** is a Special Grass-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user gathers an immense amount of Z-Power and channeled solar energy to force a rapid, explosive botanical growth. This botanical force culminates in a massive floral eruption that blankets the battlefield, overwhelming the target with the raw power of nature.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used if the trainer possesses a Z-Ring (or Z-Power Ring) and the Pokémon is holding **Grassium Z**. Its power is variable, scaling based on the base Grass-type move used to trigger it. It bypasses accuracy checks to always hit the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (standard Z-Move damage). If used against a target using Protect or Detect, it deals 25% of its original damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** One-time Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Bloom Doom is used to secure a One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) on bulky threats that would otherwise survive a standard STAB move. It is often paired with high-power base moves like **Leaf Storm** (resulting in a 195 BP Bloom Doom) or **Solar Beam** (resulting in 190 BP) to eliminate defensive pivots. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; ignores evasion and accuracy modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a universal distribution among Pokémon capable of learning a Special Grass-type move while holding Grassium Z.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Serperior:** Often uses Bloom Doom backed by *Leaf Storm* to bypass its usual counters (like Heatran on the switch if it carries Hidden Power Ground, or simply to nuke a neutral target after a Contrary boost).
    * **Venusaur:** In Sun teams, it utilizes a 190 BP Bloom Doom via *Solar Beam* to delete threats without needing a charge turn.
    * **Tapu Koko:** Frequently carries *Grass Knot* as a base to turn into Bloom Doom, allowing it to lure and eliminate Ground-type checks like Hippowdon or Gastrodon.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Special attackers like **Heatran** (via *Solar Beam*) or **Volcarona** (via *Giga Drain*) in specific competitive formats to surprise and lure Water-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII via the **Grassium Z** Crystal, obtained after completing Mallow’s trial in Lush Jungle.
