## Identity & Mechanics
**Magnitude** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user creates a localized seismic disturbance, shaking the ground with unpredictable intensity. The tremors range from minor rumbles to catastrophic tectonic shifts, releasing energy that can shatter the earth beneath the target. This move is a staple for Ground-type Pokémon during early to mid-game progression, simulating the chaotic nature of an earthquake.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage with a variable Power rating ranging from 10 to 150. The Power is determined by a random "Magnitude" roll (4 through 10). On average, the move has a Power of 71.
* **Secondary Effect:** This move deals **double damage** (2x) to targets that are currently in the semi-invulnerable underground state of the move **Dig**.
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Spread move in Double/Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Early-game STAB.
* **Usage:** Magnitude is the "gambler's" alternative to **Earthquake**. While Earthquake provides a consistent 100 Power, Magnitude has a 15% chance to outperform it (Magnitude 9 or 10) but a 65% chance to be weaker (Magnitude 4 through 7). Due to this inconsistency, it is almost never used in serious competitive play, where reliability is prioritized. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a Ground-based spread move; it does not make contact and does not affect Pokémon with the Levitate ability or Flying-types.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, primarily restricted to Pokémon with thematic ties to the earth or tectonic activity (24 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include the **Geodude line (Golem)**, the **Diglett line (Dugtrio)**, and **Camerupt**. These Pokémon often rely on Magnitude as their primary Ground STAB move during level-up before accessing Earthquake.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Golurk** or **Mudbray/Mudsdale** during the main story of their respective games. **Lickitung** is a rare non-Ground type that can learn it, providing unexpected coverage against Steel types.
* **Acquisition:** Magnitude is almost exclusively a **Level-up move**. It is not available as a TM or TR in any generation, making its distribution much more limited than the ubiquitous Earthquake.
