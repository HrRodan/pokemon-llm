## Identity & Mechanics
**Giga Drain** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user siphons the life energy from the target through a series of roots or a draining beam, nourishing itself with the stolen nutrients. This move is a staple for tactical recovery, allowing the user to maintain offensive pressure while simultaneously restoring its HP.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and restores the user's HP by 50% of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The healing effect is a primary mechanic of the move).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Sustainability STAB / Longevity Tool.
* **Usage:** While outclassed in raw power by *Energy Ball* (90 BP) or *Leaf Storm* (130 BP), Giga Drain is the preferred choice for bulky attackers and "Stall" archetypes. It allows Pokémon to bypass the need for *Recover* or *Roost* turns, maintaining momentum. It is especially potent when used by Pokémon with the **Big Root** held item, which increases the amount of HP recovered. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; affected by Liquid Ooze (damages the user instead of healing); boosted by the ability Triage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (253 learners), making it one of the most accessible Grass-type moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Venusaur** (essential for its Sun-sweeper and Mega sets), **Amoonguss** (provides immense staying power alongside Regenerator), and **Serperior** (used to offset Life Orb recoil while sweeping).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Grass Pokémon such as **Volcarona** to hit Water-type checks like Tapu Fini or Gastrodon, and **Gengar** or **Eelektross** for unexpected Special coverage against Ground-types.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM or TR** (TM19 in Gen 4, TR65 in Gen 8, TM111 in Gen 9) across almost every region.
