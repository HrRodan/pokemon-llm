## Identity & Mechanics
**Mud-Bomb** is a Special Ground-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user hurls a dense, high-velocity projectile of hard-packed, sludge-like mud at the target. Upon impact, the mud splatters violently, potentially obscuring the opponent's vision and coating their sensors or eyes in filth. This tactical disruption is designed to disorient the foe while dealing concussive damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30%** chance to lower the target’s **Accuracy** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Early-game Special Coverage / Niche Accuracy Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Mud-Bomb is generally considered a sub-optimal choice in competitive play compared to **Earth Power**, which offers higher base power (90) and perfect accuracy (100%). However, it serves as a vital mid-level Special Ground option for Pokémon that lack access to more powerful Earth-based attacks. Its 30% accuracy-drop chance provides a small "hax" element that can force switches or cause misses in desperate scenarios. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a **Bullet/Bomb move**, meaning it is blocked by the ability **Bulletproof** (commonly found on Chesnaught). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution, being learned by 39 different species through leveling up or breeding.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on **Swampert**, **Gastrodon**, and **Quagsire** as a leveling-up tool. It is also a thematic staple for **Hippowdon** and **Mamoswine**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often utilized by non-Ground Pokémon such as **Toxicroak**, **Muk**, and **Arbok** to provide essential Special Ground-type coverage against Steel and Rock types that would otherwise wall their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Acquisition:** While not a TM or TR in recent generations, it is a common Level-Up move for swamp-dwelling and subterranean Pokémon.
