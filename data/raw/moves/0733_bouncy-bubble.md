## Identity & Mechanics
**Bouncy Bubble** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically as a signature move in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*.
* **Description:** The user launches a playful yet powerful barrage of pressurized water bubbles at the opponent. Upon impact, these bubbles burst into a soothing mist that the user absorbs, drawing out the target's life force to replenish its own. This move combines offensive pressure with high-sustain recovery, making it a "drain" archetype move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and heals the user for 50% of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (The healing is considered a primary effect of the move).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Sustainability STAB / HP Draining Utility.
* **Usage:** Bouncy Bubble serves as a reliable recovery tool that allows the user to stay on the field while simultaneously chipping away at the opponent. It functions similarly to **Giga Drain** or **Drain Kiss**, but benefits from the Water type’s excellent offensive profile. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Context:** Compared to standard Water moves like *Surf* or *Hydro Pump*, Bouncy Bubble has lower raw output but significantly higher utility. In its debut, it transformed a typically frail Pokémon into a formidable "drain-tank" that can outlast opponents through constant health regeneration.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Special attack and does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is a unique "Partner Move" (1 learner total).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Partner Eevee** (the starter Eevee in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as an exclusive signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, for Partner Eevee, it provides essential Water-type coverage to check Rock and Ground types that might otherwise resist its Normal-type STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via a Move Tutor located in Pokémon Centers in the Kanto region (LGPE). It is not available via TM, TR, or Breeding in any other generation.
