## Identity & Mechanics
**Chilling Water** is a Special Water-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a stream of frigid, sub-zero water onto the target. The intense cold is so biting that it saps the target's physical strength, effectively numbing their muscles and reducing their offensive pressure. This move is designed to punish physical attackers by lowering their damage output while dealing chip damage.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and **guarantees** a reduction in the target's Attack stat by one stage (100% activation rate).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target's **Attack** by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Utility Debuff / Defensive Support.**
* **Usage:** Chilling Water serves as the spiritual successor to *Scald* in many Generation IX movepools, though it trades raw power and the Burn status for a **guaranteed** Attack drop. It is primarily used by defensive walls to neuter physical sweepers, making it much harder for them to force a breakthrough. While its base power is low, its utility in doubling as a "Special Intimidate" makes it a staple for stall and balance teams. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses effects like *Bulletproof*; affected by *Sheer Force* (which removes the Attack drop for a power boost).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very wide** distribution (223 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves for both Water and non-Water types.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by premier defensive threats such as **Toxapex**, **Dondozo**, **Slowbro**, and **Clodsire** (Paldean form) to mitigate physical threats. It is also a common choice for **Blastoise** and **Vaporeon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon with high utility roles, such as **Grimmsnarl**, **Mew**, and **Blissey**, allowing them to provide team support by softening physical hits from opposing Wallbreakers. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM022** in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, ensuring almost any Pokémon with a modicum of elemental versatility can slot it into a support set.
