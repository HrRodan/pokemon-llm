## Identity & Mechanics
**Sleep Talk** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** While deep in slumber, the user mutters and shifts, subconsciously unleashing a random attack from its known moveset. This move allows a Pokémon to remain a credible threat even while incapacitated by sleep, turning a defensive downtime into an unpredictable offensive or setup window.
* **Effect:** Only usable while the user is asleep. It randomly selects one of the user’s other three moves to execute. The selected move consumes 0 PP, though Sleep Talk itself costs PP.
* **Restrictions:** It cannot select multi-turn moves (like Fly, Dig, or Solar Beam), focus moves (Focus Punch), or other metagame moves (Assist, Metronome, or another Sleep Talk).
* **Targeting:** Self (The move called targets based on its own original properties).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Sustainability Tool.
* **Usage:** Sleep Talk is the cornerstone of the legendary **"RestTalk" strategy**. By pairing this move with **Rest**, a Pokémon can fully restore its HP and cure status conditions, then use Sleep Talk to bypass the two-turn "immobility" period of sleep. It is primarily used by bulky tanks to stall out opponents or by setup sweepers to boost their stats while safely recovering.
* **Context:** Unlike its counterpart *Snore*, which has a fixed low power, Sleep Talk can potentially pull high-damage "Nukes" or powerful "Setup" moves like Calm Mind or Bulk Up, making the user much harder to exploit while sleeping.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses the need for PP on the called move; fails if the user is awake.

    * **Dondozo:** A modern physical wall that utilizes RestTalk to maintain its presence and ignore physical attackers in the Gen 9 competitive circuit.
    * **Kyogre:** Often runs defensive sets in Restricted formats to check Choice Scarf users and heal off chip damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on defensive pivots like **Milotic** or **Zapdos** to ensure they aren't "passive" or vulnerable to being set up on while they recover.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM/TR** across almost every generation (TM35 in Gen 2, TM88 in Gen 7, TR27 in Gen 8).
