## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Mixed Setup / Offensive Buffer.
* **Usage:** Work-Up is a niche setup move primarily utilized by **Mixed Sweepers**—Pokémon that utilize both Physical and Special attacks to break through different defensive walls. While it is generally outclassed by specialized boosting moves like *Swords Dance* (+2 Attack) or *Nasty Plot* (+2 Sp. Atk), it is the premier choice for Pokémon that lack those options or need to maintain a dual-threat presence. In lower competitive tiers, it serves as a reliable way to punish switches.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (targets self). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (**343 learners**), making it one of the most accessible setup moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Lucario**, **Infernape**, and **Blaziken**, all of whom possess the "Mixed Attacker" stat distribution necessary to capitalize on both boosts. It is also a staple for **Pidgeot (Mega)** and **Zangoose** in specific formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Hydreigon** or **Silvally** to allow them to bypass traditional counters; for example, a Special-leaning Hydreigon might use Work-Up to boost a physical *Superpower* to surprise a Specially Defensive Chansey.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely easy to acquire, appearing as **TM83** in Gen V, **TM01** in Gen VII, and **TR75** in Gen VIII. It is often one of the first TMs available to players in various regional playthroughs.
