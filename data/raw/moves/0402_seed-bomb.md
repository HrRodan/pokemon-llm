## Identity & Mechanics
**Seed Bomb** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user launches a barrage of hard-shelled, explosive seeds from above, slamming them into the target to cause blunt-force impact and concussive damage. This move is characterized by its explosive nature, making it a "ball and bomb" move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Seed Bomb serves as the primary physical Grass-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for Pokémon that lack access to more specialized moves like **Leaf Blade** (higher critical hit ratio) or **Power Whip** (higher power, lower accuracy). It is preferred in competitive sets where reliability is valued over the high-risk, high-reward nature of **Wood Hammer** (which inflicts recoil). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Classified as a **Bullet/Bomb move**; it is blocked by the ability **Bulletproof** (e.g., Chesnaught). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (223 learners), serving as a staple physical move for almost all plant-based attackers and several bulky Normal-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Venusaur**, **Breloom**, **Torterra**, and **Chesnaught**. It is often the most consistent physical option for **Shiftry** and **Exeggutor-Alola**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Grass Pokémon like **Snorlax**, **Ursaluna**, and **Donphan** to provide crucial coverage against bulky Water-types (like Dondozo or Slowbro) and Ground/Rock types that would otherwise wall their Normal or Ground STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM (Technical Machine)** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), and previously as a common Move Tutor option.
