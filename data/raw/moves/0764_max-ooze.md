## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Ooze** is a variable Damage Class Poison-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A powerful Dynamax-exclusive attack where the user floods the battlefield with a massive wave of toxic sludge or concentrated bio-toxins. This move is characterized by its iridescent, corrosive purple energy that erupts from the Dynamaxed Pokémon, exerting immense pressure on the target while simultaneously stimulating the special offensive capabilities of the user's team.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the **Special Attack** stat of the user and all active allies by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to provide the Special Attack boost.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon; ignores protection moves (dealing 25% chip damage through Max Guard/Protect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 70–95], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Setup Sweep / Offensive Support.**
* **Usage:** Unlike other Max Moves that typically reach 130+ Power, Max Ooze is intentionally capped at a lower base power (maximum 95) to balance its incredibly potent secondary effect. In the VGC (Doubles) format, it is a premier tool for **"Snowballing"**—allowing a Special Attacker to increase its damage output every turn while dealing damage. It is the primary offensive answer to **Fairy-types** and **Grass-types**, which are prevalent in the competitive meta.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (never misses). Hits for **Super Effective** damage against **Grass** and **Fairy** types.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution, as any Pokémon capable of learning a Poison-type attacking move can access it while Dynamaxed.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Venusaur (Gigantamax):** Frequently used in Sun teams to boost Special Attack while checking Fairy-types.
    * **Toxtricity:** Utilizes its STAB Max Ooze to reach terrifying levels of Special Power.
    * **Gengar:** A classic Special Attacker that uses this move to break through bulky walls.
    * **Nihilego:** An Ultra Beast that can stack Max Ooze boosts with its Beast Boost ability for rapid late-game sweeps.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Poison Pokémon like **Togekiss** or **Dragapult** (via Poison Jab or Steel Wing/Sludge Bomb coverage) to punish switch-ins from Fairy-type counters like Primarina or Tapu Fini.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible to any Pokémon equipped with a Poison-type move (TM/TR/Egg Move) during the Dynamax phenomenon.
