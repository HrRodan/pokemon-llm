## Identity & Mechanics
**Storm Throw** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova region).
* **Description:** The user utilizes advanced martial arts techniques to grapple the opponent and deliver a high-impact, fierce blow. By striking with expert precision, the user ensures the attack always finds a weak point, shattering the opponent's defenses. This move is characterized by its technical execution, often depicted as a judo-style toss or a concentrated physical strike that bypasses the target's fortitude.
* **Effect:** This move is mechanically unique because it is programmed to **always result in a critical hit** (unless the target has the Ability Battle Armor or Shell Armor, or is under the effect of Lucky Chant). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (the critical hit is a guaranteed primary property). Because it always crits, it effectively ignores the target’s positive Defense stat stage changes and the user’s negative Attack stat stage changes.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Anti-Setup Utility.**
* **Usage:** While its base power is 60, the guaranteed critical hit provides a 1.5x multiplier, giving it an **effective base power of 90**. It serves as a specialized counter to "Stall" or "Setup" strategies; it is the physical counterpart to the move *Frost Breath*. Unlike *Close Combat*, which has higher raw power but lowers the user's defenses, Storm Throw allows a Pokémon to chip away at defensive behemoths using *Iron Defense* or *Cosmic Power*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (only 4 learners in the provided data).
* **Prominent Users:** It is most iconically associated with **Throh**, the Judo Pokémon, who uses it to capitalize on his bulk. It is also utilized by **Pinsir** and **Mega Pinsir**, where the latter can use it to bypass physical walls, and the **Pancham** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as a coverage move on non-Fighting types. It is primarily a niche STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for its specific learners to handle defensive boosters like *Curselax* or *Iron Defense* users.
* **Acquisition:** This move has **no TM or TR availability**, making it a "natural" or "egg move" exclusive to its very small pool of practitioners.
