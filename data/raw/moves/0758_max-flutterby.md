## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Flutterby** is a Variable (Physical or Special) **Bug**-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A powerful Dynamax-exclusive attack where the user manifests massive, spectral insectoid wings or a swarm of glowing energy butterflies to bombard the target. As a Max Move, it represents the pinnacle of Bug-type offensive pressure, saturating the battlefield with debilitating pheromones or scale dust.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and **lowers the target's Special Attack stat by one stage**. This effect bypasses protection moves like Protect or Detect (dealing 25% chip damage) and never misses.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reduce the opponent's Special Attack.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 90–150], Accuracy [∞]%, PP [10].
* **Role:** **Dynamax Nuke / Defensive Utility.** 
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the Sword & Shield competitive circuit (VGC and Singles) to neutralize Special Sweepers. While Bug is often considered a weak offensive typing, Max Flutterby is a vital tool for survivability, effectively "softening" incoming Special attacks from threats like Kyogre or Calyrex-Shadow. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic, Dark, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; Power scales based on the base move (e.g., Megahorn results in a 140 BP Max Flutterby, while U-turn results in 120 BP).

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move is available to **any Pokémon** that knows a damaging Bug-type move while it is Dynamaxed. Because it is a transformation of existing moves, its distribution is technically vast.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Volcarona:** Uses it to stack Special Attack drops on foes while potentially setting up its own Quiver Dances.
    * **Buzzwole:** Provides a massive Physical Bug-type nuke to crush Dark and Psychic types while making itself harder to revenge-kill by Special attackers.
    * **Pheromosa:** Leverages its high speed to apply the Special Attack drop before the opponent can move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Bug Pokémon like **Tyranitar** or **Rillaboom** (running X-Scissor or U-turn) to specifically target Grass-type checks or to provide team-wide damage mitigation against Special attackers.
* **Acquisition:** Automatically replaces any Bug-type damaging move when a Pokémon Dynamaxes; no TM/TR required for the Max Move itself.
