## Identity & Mechanics
**Parabolic Charge** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user discharges a dome of oscillating electrical energy that strikes every Pokémon in its vicinity. As the current hits its targets, the user acts as a lightning rod, siphoning away the targets' life force to replenish its own vitality. This move combines offensive pressure with significant HP restoration.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and restores the user's HP by 50% of the total damage dealt.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the health drain).
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (In Double Battles, this hits both opponents and the user's ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Recovery-based STAB / Sustain.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than standard Electric moves like **Thunderbolt** (90) or **Discharge** (80), it functions as the Electric-type equivalent of *Giga Drain*. It is primarily used to increase the longevity of Special Attackers. In Doubles, its utility increases if the user's ally has the **Volt Absorb** or **Lightning Rod** ability, turning a potential friendly-fire situation into a strategic heal or boost. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **non-contact** Special attack. It is boosted by **Hadron Engine** and **Electric Terrain**, making it significantly more threatening on specific legendary users.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (only 9 total learners), making it a relatively rare and specialized move.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Miraidon:** The premier user of this move in Gen 9. Combined with its *Hadron Engine* ability and massive Special Attack, Parabolic Charge becomes a terrifying nuke that simultaneously keeps the legendary Pokémon at full health.
    * **Heliolisk:** Often considered the original "signature" user, Heliolisk utilizes this for sustain alongside its *Dry Skin* ability.
    * **Dedenne:** Uses the move for chip damage and recovery in lower-tier formats.
    * **Bellibolt (via Tadbulb):** A bulky Special Attacker that leverages the healing to outlast opponents.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as a coverage move on non-Electric types; it is almost exclusively utilized by Pokémon receiving **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus).
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available as a TM or TR; it is primarily learned via Level Up or Egg Move, contributing to its rarity in the competitive circuit.
