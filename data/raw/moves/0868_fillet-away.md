## Identity & Mechanics
**Fillet Away** is a status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user carves away its own flesh to shed excess weight and increase its combat potential. By sacrificing exactly **50% of its maximum HP**, the user enters a heightened offensive state. This maneuver is thematically linked to the "Shed Skin" or "Fillet" concept, making the user faster and more lethal at the cost of its physical integrity.
* **Effect:** Sharply boosts the user's **Attack**, **Special Attack**, and **Speed** stats (increasing each by 2 stages). The move fails if the user's current HP is less than 50% of its maximum.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Self-sacrificing stat-boosting move).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 0, Accuracy —% (Cannot miss), PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Setup / Glass Cannon Sweeper.**
* **Usage:** Fillet Away functions as a "Shell Smash" variant that prioritizes HP consumption over defense reduction. It is a high-risk, high-reward move that allows a Pokémon to become an immediate **mixed-attacker threat** and an **outspeeding sweeper** in a single turn. Because it cuts HP by half, it is often paired with a **Sitrus Berry** to restore health immediately or used to trigger abilities like **Cud Chew** or **Defiant** (if stat-dropped previously).
* **Attributes:** It is a non-contact status move. Since it is a Normal-type status move, it bypasses type immunities but can be stopped by **Taunt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 total learner), functioning as a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, this move is the signature move of **Veluza**. It defines Veluza's competitive niche, allowing it to overcome its middling Speed and utilize its high Attack and Special Attack.
* **Coverage Utility:** While the move itself is Normal-type, it is used to enable Veluza’s wide coverage, including moves like **Aqua Cutter**, **Psychic Fangs**, and **Night Slash**, which benefit from the +2 Attack boost to break through bulky Water and Ghost-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Level-up only (Veluza learns it at Level 48). It is not currently available as a TM or TR.
