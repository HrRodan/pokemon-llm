## Identity & Mechanics
**Light of Ruin** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** Drawing upon the mystical and ancient energy of the Eternal Flower—the same power source linked to the Kalos region's "Ultimate Weapon"—the user fires a devastating, apocalyptic beam of concentrated pink light. This move represents the absolute pinnacle of destructive Fairy-type energy, incinerating the target at the cost of the user's own life force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage to a single target. The user suffers significant recoil, taking damage equal to 50% of the HP lost by the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Light of Ruin is technically the most powerful Fairy-type move in existence (excluding Z-Moves or Max Moves). It is the Fairy-type equivalent of moves like *Head Smash* or *Steel Beam*, designed to force a breakthrough against even the sturdiest walls. While **Moonblast** is preferred for consistency, Light of Ruin is a "One-Shot" tool that often results in a trade-kill due to the massive 50% recoil. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Fighting, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses effects like Bulletproof; does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (Only 1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the signature move of **Floette (Eternal Flower)**. It is unique to this specific form and cannot be learned by standard Floette or Florges.
* **Coverage Utility:** None. Because the move is hard-coded to a single, unreleased event Pokémon, it does not appear as coverage on any other species in the competitive meta. 
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is an innate move for the Eternal Flower variant.

***Note:** Despite being in the game data since X & Y, the Pokémon that learns this move (Floette-Eternal) has never been officially distributed, making this move historically significant but rare in legitimate play.*
