## Identity & Mechanics
**Meditate** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user centers their mind and find inner peace, sharpening their focus to exert greater physical force. This mental preparation manifests as a literal increase in muscular power and combat efficiency.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Attack stat by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Setup / Stat Booster.
* **Usage:** Meditate is a niche **Setup** move that is largely outclassed in competitive play. Compared to **Swords Dance**, which provides a +2 Attack boost, or **Bulk Up**, which provides +1 Attack and +1 Defense, Meditate is considered inefficient for high-level play. Its primary utility is found in lower-tier formats or during the "in-game" story where a Pokémon may lack access to more potent boosting options. While it is a Psychic-type move, it is used to power up Physical moves to deal **Super Effective** damage against types determined by the user's coverage (commonly **Normal, Ice, Rock, and Steel** for its Fighting-type learners).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; not affected by Protect (as it targets the user).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (15 learners), primarily concentrated among Human-like Egg Group Pokémon and martial-arts-themed creatures.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically associated with **Medicham** (and its Mega form) and **Mienshao**, fitting their "zen warrior" aesthetic. It is also a staple early-game move for **Hitmonlee**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mr. Mime** or **Hypno** in restricted movepool formats, though they typically prefer Special Attacking sets. It is frequently found on **Fighting-types** like **Mankey** and **Machop** to supplement their physical pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Meditate is generally **not available as a TM/TR**, making it a "natural" move learned via leveling up or as an Egg Move in certain generations.
