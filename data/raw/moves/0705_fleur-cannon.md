## Identity & Mechanics
**Fleur Cannon** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user focuses botanical and mechanical energy into its core before unleashing a colossal, shimmering beam of floral power at the target. This concentrated burst is so taxing that the recoil causes a significant temporary drain on the user's offensive capabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts heavy damage on the target. Immediately after successful execution, the user’s **Special Attack stat is lowered by two stages (-2)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the Special Attack drop upon use.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Fleur Cannon is the Fairy-type equivalent of moves like *Draco Meteor*, *Overheat*, and *Leaf Storm*. It is used to secure OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) on bulky threats. Because of the -2 Special Attack penalty, it is frequently paired with switching moves like **Volt Switch** or items like **Eject Pack** to reset the stat drops. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Fighting, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **non-contact** Special attack. It is notable for being one of the strongest Fairy-type attacks in the game, trading the reliability of *Moonblast* for raw explosive power.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** with only 2 known learners.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna** (including its **Original Color** form).
* **Synergy:** Magearna’s ability, **Soul-Heart**, creates a unique competitive loop where Fleur Cannon’s stat drop can be partially or fully mitigated if the move secures a knockout, as Soul-Heart raises Special Attack by one stage for every Pokémon that faints on the field.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor; it is learned naturally by Magearna upon reaching Level 1 or via the Move Reminder. It remains a rare and prestigious "Signature Nuke" in high-tier competitive play (Smogon OU/Ubers).
