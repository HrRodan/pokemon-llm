## Identity & Mechanics
**Twister** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user whips up a powerful, swirling vortex of draconic energy to buffet the target. This aerial cyclone creates a miniature tornado that traps opponents within its winds, making it one of the few Dragon-type moves available to a wide variety of avian and serpentine Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move is a "spread move," meaning it hits all adjacent opponents in Double Battles. Notably, if the target is in the semi-invulnerable state of **Fly**, **Bounce**, or **Sky Drop**, Twister ignores the invulnerability and deals **double power (80 Base Power)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to make the target **flinch**.
* **Targeting:** All adjacent opponents (Spread).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Niche Spread Utility.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Twister is generally considered a low-impact move, often outclassed by **Dragon Pulse** for consistency or **Draco Meteor** for raw power. Its primary niche lies in its ability to punish Flying-type maneuvers and its rare ability to cause flinching in a spread-damage scenario (useful in VGC for "flinch-hax" strategies when paired with Serene Grace or King's Rock). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses semi-invulnerability of airborne targets; Not a contact move; Blocked by Bulletproof (N/A).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (97 learners), primarily spanning Dragon-types and Pokémon with "wind" or "serpentine" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Dragonite**, **Gyarados**, **Milotic**, and the legendary **Rayquaza**, who often learns it as a basic draconic wind attack.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon Flying-types like **Pidgeot**, **Fearow**, and **Noctowl**, providing them with rare Dragon-type coverage to hit opposing Dragon-types during early-game progression. 
* **Acquisition:** While primarily learned through level-up or Egg Moves, it has appeared as a **Move Tutor** option in several generations and was a **TM** in early titles, making it highly accessible across many species.
