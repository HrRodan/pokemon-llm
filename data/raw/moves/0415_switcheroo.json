If either Pok\u00e9mon is holding mail, this move will fail.  If either Pok\u00e9mon has multitype or sticky hold, this move will fail.  If this move results in a Pok\u00e9mon obtaining choice band, choice scarf, or choice specs, and that Pok\u00e9mon was the latter of the pair to move this turn, then the move it used this turn becomes its chosen forced move.  This applies even if both Pok\u00e9mon had a choice item before this move was used.  If the first of the two Pok\u00e9mon gains a choice item, it may select whatever choice move it wishes next turn.  Neither the user nor the target can recover its item with recycle.  This move cannot be selected by assist or metronome.",
