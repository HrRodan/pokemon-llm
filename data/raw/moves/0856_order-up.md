## Identity & Mechanics
**Order Up** is a physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user, typically the massive Dondozo, attacks with elegant poise and surprising refinement for its size. This move is unique in that it interacts directly with the **Commander** ability; if the user has a **Tatsugiri** inside its mouth during a Double Battle, the move triggers a specific stat boost based on the Tatsugiri’s form (Curly, Droopy, or Stretchy).
* **Effect:** Deals damage and, if a Tatsugiri is commanding the user, increases one of the user's stats by one stage.
    * **Curly Form (Orange):** Boosts Attack.
    * **Droopy Form (Pink):** Boosts Defense.
    * **Stretchy Form (Yellow):** Boosts Speed.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise a stat (conditional on the presence of Tatsugiri).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Signature Setup STAB / Snowballing Tool.
* **Usage:** In Single Battles, Order Up is a reliable but unremarkable Dragon-type STAB move, often outclassed by more specialized options. However, in **VGC (Doubles)**, it is a centerpiece of the "DozoGiri" core. It allows Dondozo to continue increasing its stats even after the initial *Commander* boosts, making it an oppressive win condition that is difficult to wall. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Dondozo**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is limited to Dondozo, it is never seen as a coverage option on other Pokémon. For Dondozo, it provides a crucial way to bypass the "passive" nature of pure defensive walls by allowing it to build offensive or defensive momentum while attacking.
* **Acquisition:** Learned naturally by Dondozo via leveling up; it is not available as a TM or Move Tutor move for any other species.
