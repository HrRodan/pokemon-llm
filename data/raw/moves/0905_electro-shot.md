## Identity & Mechanics
**Electro-shot** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk).
*   **Description:** The user acts as a living capacitor, absorbing vast amounts of ambient energy to overclock its internal systems. After a brief charging period—marked by a significant surge in Special Attack—the user discharges a concentrated, high-voltage beam of electricity at the target. When used during Rain, the atmospheric conductivity allows the user to skip the charging phase and fire the projectile instantly.
*   **Effect:** A two-turn move. On the first turn, the user gathers energy and raises its Special Attack by one stage. On the second turn, the move deals damage. In Rain, the move executes entirely in a single turn (including the stat boost).
*   **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the user's **Special Attack** by one stage (+1) during the charging phase.
*   **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
*   **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
*   **Role:** Setup Nuke / Rain Abuser / Wallbreaker.
*   **Usage:** Electro-shot is the Electric-type equivalent of *Meteor Beam*, but with the added benefit of becoming a single-turn "Nuclear" option in Rain. It is significantly more powerful than Thunderbolt and more reliable than Thunder. It serves as both a high-damage offensive tool and a setup mechanism, allowing the user to snowball through teams. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
*   **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, Special projectile move. It is effectively countered by Pokémon with the *Volt Absorb*, *Lightning Rod*, or *Earth Eater* abilities, and Ground-types are completely immune.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), serving as a signature move.
*   **Prominent Users:** This move is the signature of **Archaludon**. It defines Archaludon's role in the competitive metagame, particularly on Rain-themed teams where it can spam 130-power attacks while simultaneously boosting its Special Attack every turn.
*   **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Electric Pokémon learn this move, as it is restricted to the Duraludon evolution line. It allows Archaludon (a Steel/Dragon type) to threaten bulky Water-types like Dondozo or Flying-types like Corviknight that might otherwise wall its STAB combination.
*   **Acquisition:** Exclusive to Archaludon via evolution or level-up; it is not available as a TM or TR.
