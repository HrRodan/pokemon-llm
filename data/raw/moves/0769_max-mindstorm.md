## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Mindstorm** is a Psychic-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region), exclusively available to Pokémon while they are **Dynamaxed**.
* **Description:** The user focuses its immense Dynamax energy into a colossal mental assault, manifesting as a wave of telekinetic power that crushes the target. The residual psychic energy radiates outward, warping the environment and transforming the battlefield into **Psychic Terrain** for five turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and automatically sets Psychic Terrain. This terrain boosts the power of Psychic-type moves by 30% (1.3x) and protects all grounded Pokémon from moves with increased priority (e.g., Extreme Speed, Fake Out, Prankster-boosted moves).
* **Secondary Effect:** Guaranteed battlefield transformation into **Psychic Terrain**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales: 100–150], Accuracy [—]%, PP [Derived from Base Move].
* **Role:** **Field-Setting Nuke** / **Utility Offensive.**
* **Usage:** As a Max Move, it is a high-horsepower attack that cannot miss. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to overwrite other terrains (like Rillaboom’s Grassy Terrain) and shut down **Priority-reliant strategies**. By setting Psychic Terrain, the user ensures its teammates are safe from moves like Sucker Punch or Grassy Glide. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power and category (Physical/Special) are determined by the base move it is derived from.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move has a **universal distribution** among any Pokémon capable of learning a Psychic-type attacking move in Generation VIII.
* **Prominent Users:**

    * **Metagross:** Uses the Physical variant to set terrain, boosting its Zen Headbutt and protecting itself from Prankster-status moves or priority fire moves.
    * **Alakazam/Hatterene:** Frequently used these in Trick Room or hyper-offensive builds to maximize damage output.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often utilized by non-Psychic Pokémon like **Gengar** or **Togekiss** (via Psychic coverage) to disrupt the opponent's terrain or to provide team-wide immunity to priority moves.
