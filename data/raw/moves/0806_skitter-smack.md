## Identity & Mechanics
**Skitter Smack** is a physical Bug-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** The user exhibits agile, insect-like movement, rapidly skittering into the target's blind spot to deliver a sudden, jarring physical strike. This tactical maneuver disorients the opponent, dampening their focus and reducing their ability to channel special energy.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and is guaranteed to lower the target's **Special Attack** stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** **100% chance** to lower Special Attack.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Utility Attacker / Anti-Special Debuffer.**
* **Usage:** Skitter Smack serves as a niche utility option for physical attackers to neuter special-attacking threats on the switch. While its **70 Power** is lower than *X-Scissor* (80) or *Leech Life* (80), the guaranteed Sp. Atk drop provides defensive utility similar to *Struggle Bug*, but on the physical side. Its **90% Accuracy** is its primary drawback, making it a "High-Risk Utility" move compared to perfectly accurate alternatives. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.
