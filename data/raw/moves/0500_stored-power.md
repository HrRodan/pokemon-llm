## Identity & Mechanics
**Stored Power** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy, projecting a psychic blast that scales in intensity based on the user's mental and physical enhancements. It converts stat augmentations into raw destructive force, making it more powerful the more the user has prepared for battle.
* **Effect:** Deals damage with a base power of 20. This power increases by 20 for every positive stat stage the user has accumulated across all stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion). Negative stat stages do not decrease the base power. At maximum boosts (+6 in all seven categories), the move reaches a staggering 860 base power.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20 (Variable), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Win-Condition / Setup Sweeper Nuke.
* **Usage:** Stored Power is the cornerstone of "Cheese" or "Snowball" strategies. It is functionally weak upon entry, but after just two **Calm Minds** (+4 total stages), it reaches 100 Power, surpassing **Psychic**. It is primarily used by bulky setup sweepers that can survive long enough to accumulate boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, Special projectile. It is notably blocked by Dark-type Pokémon (who are immune to Psychic) and can be hindered by "Unaware" users who ignore the stat boosts for damage calculation.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (173 learners), primarily appearing on Psychic and Fairy-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Espathra:** Utilizes the **Speed Boost** ability to naturally ramp up Stored Power's damage every turn while using **Calm Mind** or **Protect**.
    * **Mew:** Frequently runs a "Cosmic Power" set, boosting both defenses simultaneously to become unkillable while Stored Power's damage skyrockets.
    * **Latias / Latios:** Often seen using Soul Dew or Calm Mind sets in various competitive tiers to break through defensive cores.
    * **Magearna:** Its **Soul-Heart** ability grants a Special Attack boost every time a Pokémon faints, fueling Stored Power passively in doubles or late-game sweeps.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Clefable** or **Hatterene** as a way to punish opponents who allow them to set up multiple Calm Minds, turning a defensive Pokémon into a late-game wallbreaker.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in recent titles like *Sword & Shield* and *Scarlet & Violet*.
