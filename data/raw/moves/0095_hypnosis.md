## Identity & Mechanics
**Hypnosis** is a status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user employs suggestive rhythmic movements or intense psychic waves to lull the target into a deep, involuntary slumber. This classic incapacitating technique is a staple for Pokémon that manipulate the mind or spirit, often serving as a setup for more predatory moves like Dream Eater or Nightmare.
* **Effect:** Puts the target to **Sleep**. Sleeping Pokémon are unable to move for 1–3 turns, making them vulnerable to free switches or setup opportunities.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 60%, PP 20.
* **Role:** High-Risk Status Utility / Sleep Enabler.
* **Usage:** Hypnosis is often categorized as a "High-Risk, High-Reward" move. Compared to its rivals, **Spore** (100% accuracy) and **Sleep Powder** (75% accuracy), Hypnosis is significantly less reliable. However, it possesses a key advantage: it is **not a powder-based move**, meaning it can successfully put Grass-type Pokémon and Overcoat ability users to sleep. It is frequently paired with the **Wide Lens** item to boost its shaky accuracy to approximately 66%.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses protection effects like Magic Powder but is blocked by **Magic Bounce**, **Insomnia**, and **Vital Spirit**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, learned by 88 different Pokémon across various generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Gengar**, **Alakazam**, and **Hypno**. In modern competitive formats, it is a dangerous tool for **Iron Valiant**, **Gardevoir**, and **Gallade**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon such as **Milotic**, **Ninetales**, and **Spiritomb** to provide much-needed crowd control and utility in stall or balanced team archetypes. **Darkrai** occasionally utilizes Hypnosis as a higher-accuracy alternative to its signature Dark Void (which was nerfed to 50% accuracy).
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it has rarely been available as a TM, making it a specialized tool for natural learners and those in the Human-Like egg group.
