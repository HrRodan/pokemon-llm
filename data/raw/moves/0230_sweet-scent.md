## Identity & Mechanics
**Sweet Scent** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user releases an alluring, pleasant aroma from its body or flowers to distract the target and lower their guard. This cloud of scent fills the battlefield, making it significantly harder for the opposition to dodge incoming attacks. Outside of battle, this move was historically used to attract wild Pokémon encounters or trigger Horde Battles in specific regions.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target's Evasion stat by one stage. This increases the effective accuracy of all moves used against the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents. In Double Battles, it affects both foes simultaneously.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Evasion-Counter.
* **Usage:** Sweet Scent is a niche **Evasion Check**. While lowering evasion is theoretically useful for high-power, low-accuracy moves (like *Sleep Powder* or *Zap Cannon*), it is generally considered inferior to **Defog**, which lowers evasion while also clearing entry hazards. Its primary competitive value is found in lower-tier doubles formats where it can soften up two targets at once, though it is rarely seen in high-level Overused (OU) play.
* **Attributes:** This is a **scent-based** move. It hits through *Substitute* in some generations and targets all adjacent foes in multi-battle formats. It does not deal damage, so it does not interact with type effectiveness.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (94 learners), primarily concentrated among Grass, Bug, and Fairy types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Grass-type "flower" Pokémon such as **Venusaur**, **Vileplume**, **Meganium**, and **Bellossom**. It is also a signature-style flavor move for **Alcremie** and **Ribombee**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Grass Pokémon like **Ursaluna** and **Mawile**, where it fits their thematic ties to honey or luring prey. **Salazzle** also utilizes it, fitting its pheromone-based flavor.
* **Acquisition:** It was available as **TM12** in Generation II and remains a common level-up move for botanical and nectar-gathering Pokémon throughout all subsequent generations. In older titles, it was a vital utility move for "Horde Hunting" to find Shiny Pokémon.
