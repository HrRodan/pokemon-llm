## Identity & Mechanics
**Gigavolt Havoc (Special)** is a Special Electric-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** As the signature Electric-type Z-Move, the user channels its Z-Power through the Electrium Z crystal, surrounding itself in a surging aura of high-voltage yellow energy. It then unleashes a colossal, catastrophic discharge of electricity that strikes the target with immense force. This move represents the absolute peak of Electric-type offensive power in the Alola region.
* **Effect:** This move deals damage based on the power of the original base Electric-type move selected by the user. As a Z-Move, it bypasses standard accuracy checks and carries a "never-miss" property under normal conditions. It also penetrates defensive barriers like *Protect* or *Detect*, dealing 25% of its total damage through the shield.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power is determined by the base move).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–185], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / High-Risk Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Gigavolt Havoc is used to secure a crucial OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) on a defensive threat that might otherwise survive a standard Thunderbolt or Discharge. It is often compared to **Thunderbolt** (consistency) or **Thunder** (high risk/high reward); the Z-Move provides the power of Thunder without the accuracy drawback for one turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; penetrates Protection moves (partial damage).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn a Special Electric-type move and hold the **Electrium Z** item.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Tapu Koko:** Frequently used this move in Gen VII to capitalize on its *Electric Surge* ability, creating a boosted nuke that few Pokémon could switch into.
    * **Xurkitree:** Utilized this to leverage its massive Special Attack stat to break through even the sturdiest Specially Defensive walls.
    * **Raichu (Alola Form):** Often used this in conjunction with *Surge Surfer* to outspeed the meta and delete a single target.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Gengar** or **Magnezone** to lure in and eliminate specific counters like Celesteela or Toxapex.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII games via the **Electrium Z** Z-Crystal; the mechanic was retired in later generations in favor of Dynamax and Terastallization.
