## Identity & Mechanics
**Snore** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** A rhythmic and noisy attack emitted while the user is slumbering. The user exhales a powerful, vibrating sound wave during sleep that startles the target, potentially disrupting their concentration. Because it is sound-based, it bypasses the effects of moves like Substitute in later generations.
* **Effect:** This move can only be successfully executed while the user is under the **Sleep** status condition (including sleep induced by the move Rest). 
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Sleep-Reliant Utility / Flinch Support.
* **Usage:** Snore is primarily used on bulky "Rest-Talk" style sets as a way to maintain offensive pressure and fishing for flinches while recovering HP. While its rival move **Sleep Talk** is generally preferred for its ability to pull higher-power moves from the user's kit, Snore provides a guaranteed (albeit weak) hit and a high flinch chance. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, and is completely ineffective against **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based move (bypasses Substitute); interacts with the ability **Serene Grace** to raise the flinch rate to a significant 60%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Snore has a **Massive** distribution (1072 learners), as nearly every Pokémon capable of learning TMs or sleeping can learn it.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Snorlax**, **Blissey**, and **Lapras**, who utilize their immense HP pools and the move *Rest* to stay healthy while using Snore to chip away at opponents.
* **Serene Grace Users:** Frequently seen on **Jirachi** or **Dunsparce** in casual or niche sets to maximize the 60% flinch chance, effectively "locking" an opponent while the user sleeps.
* **Coverage Utility:** Rarely used for coverage due to its low power and type; however, it is a standard "filler" move for bulky Special attackers like **Kyogre** or **Vaporeon** in specific metagames where avoiding passivity during Sleep turns is critical.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM13** in Generation II and **TR27** in Generation VIII.
