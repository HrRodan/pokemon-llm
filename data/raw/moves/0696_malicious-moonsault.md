## Identity & Mechanics
**Malicious Moonsault** is a Physical Dark-type signature Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** As the ultimate manifestation of Incineroar's fighting spirit, the user surrounds itself with a burst of Z-Power to manifest a wrestling ring of fire. It then leaps high into the air and crashes down upon the target with a devastating, explosive moonsault splash. This move is the upgraded version of **Darkest Lariat**, requiring the **Incinium Z** crystal to be held.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. Because it is a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy checks and cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig). If the target uses Protect or Detect, the move still deals 25% of its original power.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure Damage).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 180, Accuracy --%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Power Z-Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Malicious Moonsault is used as a one-time "delete button" to bypass bulky walls or secure a KO on a neutral threat. Since its base move is typically **Darkest Lariat**, it is particularly effective against opponents who have boosted their Defense, as the calculation ignores the target’s stat changes. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** While it is a Physical smash, Z-Moves possess unique properties that allow them to ignore many traditional move-limiting effects like Taunt or Encore.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, as it is a Signature Z-Move.
* **Prominent Users:** This move is exclusive to **Incineroar**. No other Pokémon can access this move, as it requires the specific combination of Incineroar, the move Darkest Lariat, and the Incinium Z held item.
* **Coverage Utility:** Not applicable for coverage on other species; however, for Incineroar, it provides a massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) nuke that allows it to transition from its usual "Intimidate Pivot" role into a sudden offensive threat.
* **Acquisition:** Available only in Generation VII via the **Incinium Z** crystal, which is gifted to the player by Professor Kukui or Hau in the Alola region. In later generations, this move is unavailable due to the removal of the Z-Move mechanic.
