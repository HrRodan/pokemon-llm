## Identity & Mechanics
**Misty Explosion** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user releases all of its internal energy in a violent, pink-hued detonation that sparkles with fairy light, hitting every Pokémon on the field. The sheer force of the blast causes the user to faint immediately. When the battlefield is covered in **Misty Terrain**, the move's potency is significantly amplified as it draws power from the surrounding mist.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage on all other Pokémon in battle. The user faints instantly upon use, even if the move misses or the target is protected. If used on Misty Terrain, its base power is increased by 1.5x (reaching 150 Power).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The self-KO is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100 (150 in Misty Terrain), Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Spread Nuke / Suicide Pivot.
* **Usage:** Primarily used as a "final gambit" to deal massive damage before a Pokémon faints, or to provide a "free switch" into a teammate without wasting a turn. While **Moonblast** is the preferred reliable STAB, Misty Explosion serves as a specialized tool on teams utilizing **Misty Surge**. It is the Special-attacker's equivalent to the classic move *Explosion*, but with superior type coverage, hitting **Dragon, Dark, and Fighting** types for **Super Effective** damage.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; unaffected by King's Rock; blocked by the ability *Damp*.

* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Legendary threats like **Enamorus** and **Magearna** to exert massive pressure or deny momentum to the opponent.
* **Acquisition:** It was introduced as a Move Tutor move in the Isle of Armor (Gen VIII) and is widely available via **TM** in Gen IX (Scarlet/Violet).
