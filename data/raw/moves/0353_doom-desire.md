## Identity & Mechanics
**Doom Desire** is a Special Steel-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user focuses its celestial energy to make a dark wish, summoning a catastrophic burst of light and starlight from the heavens that strikes the target two turns after the move is initiated. This move is the signature power of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi, themed around its "Wish Maker" lore.
* **Effect:** This is a delayed-damage move. Two turns after the move is used, the target (or the Pokémon currently in that slot) takes damage at the end of the turn. The damage calculation is based on the user's Special Attack at the time the move was cast. While it originally dealt typeless damage in earlier generations, it now functions as a Steel-type attack. It bypasses **Wonder Guard**, and while it can be blocked by **Protect** on the turn of activation, the final damage on the third turn ignores **Protect**, **Detect**, **Endure**, and **Focus Sash**.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (No status or stat-drop chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Delayed Nuke / Tactical Pressure Tool.
* **Usage:** Doom Desire is used to create "checkmate" scenarios. By initiating a massive 140-power hit that arrives later, the user forces the opponent into a precarious position where they must decide between taking a massive STAB hit or switching into a teammate that might be vulnerable to the user's *current* move. It is the Steel-type equivalent to **Future Sight**, but with significantly higher base power, making it one of the strongest Steel moves in the game. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses most protection and "1-HP" survival mechanics (Endure/Sash) on the turn it lands.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a unique signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Jirachi**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Jirachi, it is never seen as a coverage move on other species. On Jirachi, it is often paired with **U-turn** to "pivot" out after setting the move, allowing a teammate to benefit from the pressure the delayed hit creates.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is obtained only via Jirachi's natural level-up or event distributions.
