## Identity & Mechanics
**Earth Power** is a Special Ground-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user harnesses tectonic energy to make the ground beneath the target erupt with seismic force. This move represents the primary special-attacking counterpart to the physical move Earthquake, characterized by its high reliability and devastating geological impact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to lower the target’s Special Defense by one stage. This effect is frequently exploited by Pokémon with the **Sheer Force** ability to boost raw damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Special Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Earth Power is the gold standard for Special Ground-type offense. While it lacks the raw power of *Earthquake* or the spread damage of *Precipice Blades*, its perfect accuracy and lack of drawbacks make it essential for Special Attackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types, making it one of the most valuable offensive types in the meta for breaking through Steel-type walls.
* **Attributes:** Does not make contact. Not a pulse, sound, or wind move, meaning it bypasses most specialized defensive abilities like Bulletproof or Soundproof.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (257 learners), making it a staple coverage move for diverse movepools.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Nidoking/Nidoqueen:** The premier users of this move; when combined with the **Sheer Force** ability and a Life Orb, Earth Power becomes a terrifying nuke with no recoil.
    * **Landorus (Incarnate):** Utilizes Earth Power as its primary STAB to dismantle physical walls.
    * **Heatran:** Often carries Earth Power to win "mirror matches" against other Heatran or to hit opposing Fire and Steel types.
    * **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon):** A modern powerhouse that uses Earth Power to complement its signature Bloodmoon move for unresisted coverage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Hydreigon**, **Volcanion**, and **Dialga** to provide essential coverage against Steel-type checks that would otherwise wall their primary STABs.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible as a **TM/TR** in most modern titles (including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet) and is a common Tutor move in older generations.
