## Identity & Mechanics
**Bestow** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user performs a seemingly generous gesture by passing its held item to the target. This item manipulation move allows for strategic inventory management on the battlefield, often used to force an unwanted or detrimental "gift" onto an opponent who currently has an empty item slot.
* **Effect:** Transfers the user’s held item to the target. The move will fail if the user is not holding an item, if the target is already holding an item, or if the target is behind a substitute.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses accuracy checks), PP 15.
* **Role:** Gimmick Utility / Item Disruption.
* **Usage:** Bestow is generally considered a "High-Variance Utility" move and is largely outclassed by **Trick** or **Switcheroo**, as those moves swap items rather than requiring the user to lose their item entirely. Its primary niche involves passing detrimental items like a **Choice Band** to a passive wall, or a **Toxic Orb** to a non-Poison type. It deals **Neutral** effectiveness (as a status move) but is blocked by Pokémon with the **Sticky Hold** ability.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, non-priority status move. It was notably removed from the movepool of all Pokémon starting in Generation VIII.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (25 learners), primarily found among Pokémon themed around generosity, eggs, or forest-dwelling.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently associated with the "nursing" or "lucky" archetypes like **Chansey/Blissey**, **Clefairy**, and **Audino**. It is also a thematic fit for **Togepi** and its evolutions.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on physical attackers like **Passimian** or **Linoone** as a niche way to cripple defensive checks after the user has consumed its own item (like a Berry).
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited acquisition; it is not available via **TM/TR** and is almost exclusively learned through Leveling Up or as an Egg Move in Generations V through VII.
