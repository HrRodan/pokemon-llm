## Identity & Mechanics
**Sharpen** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user reduces its surface area and hones its body to a razor-sharp edge. This geometric optimization focuses the Pokémon's physical form, increasing the lethality of its physical strikes and maneuvers. It is a thematic staple for crystalline, artificial, or ice-based Pokémon with rigid structures.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Attack stat by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Setup / Stat-Booster.
* **Usage:** Sharpen is primarily used as a physical setup move for Pokémon that lack access to more potent boosting options. In a competitive vacuum, it is almost entirely **outclassed by Swords Dance**, which raises Attack by two stages (+2) for the same turn cost. It is generally relegated to lower-tier play or specific niche sets on Pokémon with restricted movepools. While the move itself is Normal-type, the resulting Attack boost allows the user's Physical moves to deal **Super Effective** damage more effectively against their respective targets.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by Protect-like moves (unless the user is somehow forced to target an opponent); bypasses accuracy/evasion checks as it targets the user.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (7 total learners), exclusively tied to Pokémon with geometric or crystalline anatomy.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with **Porygon**, who used its digital nature to "sharpen" its edges. It is also utilized by physical behemoths like **Avalugg** and the Mythical Pokémon **Diancie** (and its Mega Evolution) to capitalize on their high defensive stats while building offensive pressure.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it does not provide coverage itself, it is seen on Pokémon like **Cryogonal** or **Carbink** to attempt a "Physically Defensive Tank" role that can eventually retaliate with boosted physical moves like Explosion or Stone Edge.
* **Acquisition:** Unlike more common boosting moves, Sharpen is **not available as a TM or TR** in modern generations, making it a rare "natural" level-up move for a select few species.
