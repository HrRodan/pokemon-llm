## Identity & Mechanics
**Splash** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user flops, hops, or bounces around aimlessly, achieving nothing of mechanical value in a standard turn. Despite its name implying a water-based action, the move is actually a "hopping" motion (derived from its Japanese name, *Haneru*), which explains its distribution among both aquatic and land-dwelling Pokémon.
* **Effect:** The move has no direct effect on the user or the opponent. It essentially wastes the user's turn. However, it is uniquely coded to be unusable while the effect of **Gravity** is active, as the move involves leaving the ground.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance to affect stats or status).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (None), Accuracy —%, PP 40.
* **Role:** **Gimmick / High-Variance Setup.** In its base form, Splash is considered the most useless move in Pokémon history, often used as a "filler" move for weak or unevolved Pokémon. 
* **Usage:** While useless in standard play, it gained a massive niche in Generation VII via **Z-Moves**. When powered by a **Normalium Z**, it becomes **Z-Splash**, which grants the user a massive **+3 Attack boost** (equivalent to a 150% increase). This turned it into a high-risk, high-reward setup tool for physical sweepers. It deals **no damage** and thus has no type effectiveness, though as a Normal-type move, it is blocked by **Taunt**.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Not sound-based. It is classified as a "jumping" move, making it susceptible to **Gravity** suppression.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (47 learners), primarily concentrated among very weak Pokémon, "baby" Pokémon, or those with thematic jumping/flopping traits.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously used by **Magikarp**, for whom it is a signature trait. It is also the only move known by the Legendary "Nebby" (**Cosmog**) and is iconic to the **Feebas** and **Hoppip** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** In competitive Gen VII formats (SM/USUM), **Mimikyu** and **Gyarados** occasionally ran Splash alongside Normalium Z to function as "Z-Splash" sweepers, catching opponents off-guard with an immediate +3 Attack stat.
* **Acquisition:** It is almost never available via TM or TR, usually existing as a "natural" starting move or an Egg Move for specific species like **Buneary** or **Bounsweet**.
