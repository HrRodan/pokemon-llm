## Identity & Mechanics
**Slack Off** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user takes a momentary break from the heat of battle to loiter and relax. By ignoring the surrounding conflict and focusing on rest, the user instantly revitalizes its body, restoring stamina and closing wounds. This provides essential longevity for defensive archetypes.
* **Effect:** Restores the user's current HP by 50% of its maximum HP. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable Recovery / Sustain Utility.
* **Usage:** Slack Off is a fundamental recovery tool, functionally identical to moves like *Recover*, *Soft-Boiled*, and *Milk Drink*. In Generation IX, its PP was significantly reduced from 10 to 5, making it a more precious resource that requires careful management against "Stall" teams or during long wars of attrition. Unlike *Roost*, it does not temporarily remove the user's Flying typing, making it a consistent healing option regardless of the user's secondary type. It allows defensive walls to shrug off chip damage and stay on the field to support the team.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses protection if the user is the target (Self-Target); ignores type immunities as a status move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (18 total learners), typically reserved for Pokémon with a "lazy" or "relaxed" thematic design.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Slowbro / Slowking (and Galarian forms):** Iconic users that combine Slack Off with the *Regenerator* ability to become nearly unkillable pivots.
    * **Hippowdon:** A premier physical wall and Sand Stream setter that relies on Slack Off to maintain its role as a "check" to physical attackers throughout a match.
    * **Skeledirge:** A top-tier competitive threat in Gen IX that uses Slack Off alongside its *Unaware* ability to ignore opponent stat boosts and stall out threats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Infernape**; while usually an offensive "Glass Cannon," Slack Off allows bulky utility sets to surprise opponents by healing off damage while setting up *Stealth Rock*.
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability. It is primarily learned via Level Up or Egg Move; it is **not** a TM/TR move in most generations, making it a rare and highly valued part of a Pokémon's kit.
