## Identity & Mechanics
**Metronome** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user wags a finger back and forth, rhythmically tapping into the chaotic energy of the Pokémon world to manifest a completely random technique. This move is the ultimate wildcard, capable of summoning anything from a harmless Splash to a devastating Roar of Time. Because it draws from nearly the entire global move pool, it is a primary source of unpredictability in battle.
* **Effect:** Selects and executes a random move from almost all existing moves. Metronome cannot call itself, nor can it call specific "meta" moves (e.g., Assist, Copycat, Sleep Talk), protection moves (e.g., Protect, Detect), or high-utility/counter moves (e.g., Counter, Mirror Coat, Focus Punch, Destiny Bond). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The secondary effects are determined by the move randomly selected).
* **Targeting:** User (The user executes the resulting move, which then targets according to its own properties).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Chaos Utility / RNG Wildcard.
* **Usage:** Metronome is virtually never used in standard competitive play (OU, VGC) due to its extreme inconsistency, which can result in self-destructing or healing the opponent. However, it is the namesake and sole legal move of the **"Metronome Battle"** format, a popular community-driven meta centered on luck. Because it can theoretically call any offensive move, it has the potential to deal **Super Effective** damage to **any type** in the game, provided the RNG favors the user.
* **Attributes:** This move is not affected by King's Rock unless the called move hits. It cannot be copied by Mimic or Mirror Move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (149 learners), often associated with mystical, playful, or humanoid Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by the **Clefable** line and the **Togekiss** line, both of which are historically linked to the move's whimsical nature. It is also a signature part of **Mew’s** identity as the ancestor of all Pokémon.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not used for tactical coverage, high-stat Pokémon like **Snorlax**, **Alakazam**, and **Iron Valiant** can learn it, often appearing on "fun" or "gimmick" sets to surprise opponents with unexpected move types.
* **Acquisition:** It has been a recurring **TM** (Technical Machine) across multiple generations, including TM01 in Gen I, TM03 in Gen VIII, and TM080 in Gen IX.
