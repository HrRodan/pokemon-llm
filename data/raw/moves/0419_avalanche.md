## Identity & Mechanics
**Avalanche** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user calls down a crushing slide of ice and snow onto the target. This move is designed as a reactive counter-attack; by chilling the air and manipulating the local environment, the user waits for an opening created by the opponent's strike. Because it requires the user to weather an incoming blow, it is executed with decreased priority, often burying the foe under a sub-zero landslide after they have already committed to an attack.
* **Effect:** This move has a priority of -4. If the user is damaged by the target in the same turn before the move is executed, the base power of Avalanche doubles from 60 to 120.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (120 if hit), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reactive Tank STAB / Counter-Offensive Nuke.
* **Usage:** Avalanche is a niche but powerful option for bulky Pokémon with low Speed stats. Because of its **-4 Priority**, the user will almost always move last, ensuring the double-damage condition is met if the opponent uses a damaging attack. It serves as a superior alternative to Ice Punch for defensive walls that can reliably survive a hit. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types, making it a terrifying deterrent for Dragon-type sweepers.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**. It is hindered by the negative priority, making it poor for finishing off weakened foes but excellent for "trading" damage with faster physical attackers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (119 learners), appearing frequently on bulky Water, Ground, and Ice types.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly effective on **Avalugg**, **Mamoswine**, and **Cetitan**, who possess the natural bulk to absorb a hit and retaliate with a STAB-boosted 120-power nuke. It is also a staple for **Calyrex-Ice** in certain restricted formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ice Pokémon such as **Swampert**, **Gyarados**, and **Tyranitar** to provide a high-damage response to 4x Ice-weak threats like Dragonite, Garchomp, or Landorus-T.
* **Acquisition:** Avalanche is widely available via **TM** in Generations IV, VIII, and IX, making it easily accessible for competitive team building.
