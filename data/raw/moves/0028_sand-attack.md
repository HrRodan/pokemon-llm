## Identity & Mechanics
**Sand-attack** is a Status Ground-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user hurls a handful of grit, sand, or loose soil into the target's face. This tactical maneuver is designed to temporarily blind the opponent, obscuring their vision and making it significantly harder for them to aim their attacks accurately.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Accuracy stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the stat drop upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Evasion-based Disruption.
* **Usage:** While common in early-game NPC battles to frustrate players, Sand-attack sees almost no play in high-level competitive formats. It is generally outclassed by moves that provide more definitive utility, such as **Mud-Slap** (which deals chip damage) or status moves like **Thunder Wave** and **Will-O-Wisp** that cripple opponents more reliably. In Smogon-based formats, moves that modify accuracy or evasion are often restricted by "Evasion Clauses." 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Ground-type status move, it can hit Electric-type Pokémon; notably, it also affects Flying-types and Pokémon with Levitate, despite their usual immunity to Ground-type damage.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Protect" in certain older generations (Gen 1 only), but generally follows standard status move priority (0).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (121 learners), primarily found among Ground, Normal, and Flying-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the level-up sets of **Pidgeot**, **Sandslash**, **Garchomp**, and **Blaziken**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Eevee (and its evolutions)**, **Skarmory**, and **Staraptor**, where it serves as a thematic flavor move representing "dirty fighting" or wing-flapping.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned via Level-up. It has rarely been featured as a TM/TR, making it a "natural" move for most of its users.
