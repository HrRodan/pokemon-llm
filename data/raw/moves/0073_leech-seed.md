## Identity & Mechanics
**Leech Seed** is a status Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user plants a parasitic seed on the target, instantly sprouting spectral vines or roots that sap the victim's life force. This move creates a persistent drain effect, siphoning health from the opponent to rejuvenate the user at the end of every turn. It is a cornerstone of "stall" and "attrition" strategies, forcing opponents to decide between staying in and losing health or switching to clear the effect.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the "Seeded" volatile status condition. The target loses 1/8th (12.5%) of its maximum HP at the end of each turn, and the user is healed by the exact amount of HP lost by the target. This effect ends if the target switches out or uses **Rapid Spin** or **Mortal Spin**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it fails against **Grass-type** Pokémon. If the target has the **Liquid Ooze** ability, the user takes damage instead of healing. The effect can be passed to a teammate via **Baton Pass**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (Status), Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Passive Recovery / Stallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Leech Seed is a premier tool for defensive Pokémon to generate recovery while simultaneously pressuring the opponent. Unlike **Recover**, it provides "Passive Recovery," allowing the user to heal while performing other actions. It is famously paired with **Substitute** (the "SubSeed" strategy) to stall out opponents safely. It effectively checks high-HP tanks (like Blissey) because the healing is based on the target's max HP, not the user's.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal direct damage; however, **Grass-types** are immune to it, making them the primary switch-ins to neutralize the move.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect** and **Detect** in Generation I only (standard accuracy checks apply in all subsequent gens). It is not a contact move and is not blocked by **Bulletproof**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Grass-types (104 learners), though it is rarely found on non-Grass Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Venusaur**, **Serperior**, and **Whimsicott**, who utilize their speed or bulk to set up seeds. **Ferrothorn** is perhaps the most notorious user, combining Leech Seed with *Iron Barbs* and *Rocky Helmet* for massive chip damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Celesteela** (a Steel/Flying type), which uses the move to gain a form of recovery it otherwise lacks, making it exceptionally difficult to wear down. **Wo-Chien** and **Calyrex** also leverage it to enhance their staying power.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up or as an Egg Move. Notably, it is **not available as a TM/TR** in most generations, making it a specialized tool for natural Grass-types.
