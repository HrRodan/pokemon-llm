## Identity & Mechanics
**Fusion Bolt** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user generates a massive sphere of blue electricity from its tail turbine and hurls it down at the target. This legendary attack is designed to resonate with its counterpart, Fusion Flare, creating a synergistic surge of power. It represents the "Ideal" power of Zekrom, often depicted as a lightning-infused explosion that ignores common physical contact penalties.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If a teammate (in Doubles/Triples) used the move **Fusion Flare** earlier in the same turn, Fusion Bolt’s power doubles to **200**, and its visual animation changes to a more intense discharge.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% effect chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** It serves as the primary, reliable Electric STAB for its users. While **Bolt Strike** offers higher power (130), Fusion Bolt is preferred for its perfect accuracy and lack of recoil. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Crucially, despite being a physical move, Fusion Bolt **does not make contact**. This allows the user to strike targets equipped with Rocky Helmet or those with abilities like Rough Skin or Flame Body without fear of repercussions.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, restricted to legendary Pokémon (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Zekrom**, which utilizes its massive base 150 Attack to punch through neutral targets. It is also a core move for **Black Kyurem**, providing it with much-needed physical Electric-type coverage that benefits from its enormous base 170 Attack stat.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its limited distribution, it is not seen as a coverage move on other Pokémon. In the context of **Black Kyurem**, it acts as a "pseudo-STAB" coverage option to hit Water-types that would otherwise wall its Ice-type attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned exclusively via leveling up by the Tao Trio's physical representatives.
