## Identity & Mechanics
**Twineedle** is a physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user thrusts dual stingers, pincers, or sharp appendages into the target in rapid, successive strikes. This double-attack maneuver is designed to pierce defenses and inject venom directly into the opponent's system, represented by its signature twin-strike animation.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage twice in a single turn. Each hit calculates damage separately, allowing the move to bypass **Focus Sashes**, the **Sturdy** ability, and break through **Substitutes** to damage the Pokémon behind them.
* **Secondary Effect:** Each hit has a **20%** chance to Poison the target (resulting in a ~36% cumulative chance if both hits land).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (Per hit, 50 Total), Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Multi-hit Shield Breaker / Status Inflictor.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low compared to Bug-type staples like **X-Scissor** or **Megahorn**, Twineedle's utility lies in its multi-hit mechanic. It is primarily used to punish leads holding a Focus Sash or to chip away at Pokémon relying on Substitutes. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**. Despite being a multi-hit move, it is not affected by Skill Link (which only affects 2-5 hit moves), as Twineedle is fixed at two hits.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution (only 10 learners across all generations).
* **Prominent Users:** Historically the signature move of **Beedrill**; it becomes significantly more threatening when used by **Mega Beedrill** due to the **Adaptability** ability boosting its STAB damage. It is also utilized by the Bug/Steel-type **Escavalier**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Togedemaru** (Electric/Steel) and **Cloyster** (Water/Ice), providing these Pokémon with a rare Bug-type coverage option to hit Grass and Psychic types that might otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** Very rare; it is **not available as a TM or TR** in any generation, making it an exclusive level-up move for a select few spiked or venomous Pokémon.
