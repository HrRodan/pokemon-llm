## Identity & Mechanics
**Bone Club** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user wields a sturdy bone as a blunt-force weapon, clubbing the target with a heavy overhead or side-long strike. The sheer force of the impact to the opponent's head or body can cause disorientation and momentary hesitation. As a "bone" move, it carries thematic links to the burial and scavenging motifs of the Marowak line.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10% chance** to make the target **Flinch**, preventing their action for that turn if the user moves first.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Sub-optimal Physical Attacker.
* **Usage:** Bone Club is largely considered a "flavor" move and is strictly outclassed in competitive play. Its main rival is **Earthquake**, which offers significantly higher Power (100) and perfect Accuracy (100%). Even within its own user's niche, it is outclassed by **Bonemerang**, which has the same accuracy and total power but hits twice to break *Substitute* or *Focus Sash*. The 85% accuracy is a significant liability for such low base power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a physical strike with a handheld object, Bone Club is **not a contact move** in most generations, meaning the user does not trigger effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Static*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, being the signature move lineage of the Cubone family (4 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Cubone**, **Marowak (Kanto)**, and **Marowak (Alola)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is never seen as a coverage option on non-Ground types, as it cannot be learned by any Pokémon outside of the Cubone/Marowak evolution line. 
* **Acquisition:** It has **no TM, HM, or TR** availability. It is strictly learned via level-up, making it one of the rarest moves in terms of species access, despite its low competitive value.
