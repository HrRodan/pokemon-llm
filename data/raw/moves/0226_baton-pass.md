## Identity & Mechanics
**Baton Pass** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user performs a tactical retreat, passing a "baton" to a teammate that inherits the user's current momentum and battlefield conditions. This creates a bridge between a setup Pokémon and a late-game sweeper, ensuring that no temporary power-up is wasted upon switching.
* **Effect:** The user switches out, and the trainer selects a replacement. Crucially, all stat modifiers (positive and negative), confusion, and persistent effects—such as **Substitute**, **Aqua Ring**, **Ingrain**, **Magnet Rise**, and even the trapping effect of **Mean Look**—are transferred to the incoming Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Setup Enabler / Momentum Pivot.
* **Usage:** While moves like *U-turn* and *Volt Switch* provide offensive momentum, Baton Pass is unique because it preserves **Stat Boosts**. It is the central mechanic of "Baton Pass Chains," where a team builds up Speed, Defense, and Attack across several Pokémon before passing them to a "Nuke" to end the game. Due to its potential to become "uncompetitive" or "broken," it is heavily restricted or banned in many Smogon-based competitive formats.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; ignores Protection if used by a Pokémon with certain abilities (though typically a non-contact, non-offensive move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (210 learners), making it a common sight in various tier brackets.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Ninjask** (utilizing its *Speed Boost* ability), **Sylveon** (passing *Calm Mind* or *Wish*), and **Blaziken** (passing *Speed Boost* and *Swords Dance*).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Gliscor** or **Mew** to safely pivot out of bad matchups while maintaining a *Substitute* or *Swords Dance* boost to support a teammate. **Espeon** is a notable user due to *Magic Bounce* preventing it from being forced out by *Roar* or *Taunt*.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible; it has featured as a **TM/TR** in both Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
