## Identity & Mechanics
**Defend Order** is a status Bug-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user, acting as a hive sovereign, emits a pheromone command to summon a swarm of loyal underlings that congregate into a living phalanx. This biological shield reinforces the user’s physical and special constitution, making them significantly harder to displace.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Defense and Special Defense stats by one stage each (+1 Def / +1 SpD).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — / Accuracy —% / PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Tanking Tool.
* **Usage:** Functionally identical to the move **Cosmic Power**, Defend Order is designed to turn the user into a "Stallbreaker" or a defensive "Win Condition." By boosting both defensive spectrums simultaneously, the user becomes increasingly difficult to KO without relying on critical hits, the Ability **Unaware**, or the move **Haze**. It is most effective when paired with reliable recovery to outlast the opponent's offensive resources.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, status-based move. It is unaffected by most defensive abilities but can be shut down by **Taunt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This move is exclusive to **Vespiquen**. It is the cornerstone of Vespiquen's thematic "Order" move-set, representing its role as the queen of the Combee hive.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not utilized for coverage by other Pokémon. Its value is entirely dependent on Vespiquen’s viability in lower competitive tiers (like ZU or PU), where it attempts to act as a bulky pivot or setup tank.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it must be learned naturally via Level Up by Vespiquen.
