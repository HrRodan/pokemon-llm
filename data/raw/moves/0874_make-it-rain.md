## Identity & Mechanics
**Make It Rain** is a Special Steel-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a torrential downpour of cursed, solid gold coins upon the battlefield. This move combines high-density metallic impact with overwhelming mystical energy, effectively burying opponents under a mass of wealth. Because of the immense energy required to manifest such a quantity of gold, the user's mental focus is drained, resulting in a reduction of special offensive power.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and lowers the user's Special Attack stat by one stage. In Trainer battles, it functions as an upgraded version of *Pay Day*, scattering coins that are collected at the end of the battle (calculated as 5x the user's level per use).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's **Special Attack** by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** All opponents (Spread Damage in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Special Nuke / Spread Attacker.
* **Usage:** It serves as a premier **Wallbreaker** and the primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for its user. Despite the Special Attack drop, its massive 120 base power makes it significantly more threatening than *Flash Cannon*. In VGC (Doubles), its ability to hit both opponents without the accuracy checks of moves like *Blizzard* or *Hydro Pump* makes it a central metagame threat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move. As a spread move in multi-battles, its power is reduced to 75% when targeting multiple foes.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is the **Signature Move** of the #1000 Pokémon (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Gholdengo**. The move synergizes perfectly with Gholdengo’s *Good as Gold* ability, which protects it from status moves while it pummels the field with high-power Steel-type damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently unavailable as coverage for other Pokémon; however, Gholdengo often runs a **Choice Scarf** or **Choice Specs** to maximize the immediate impact of this move before the Special Attack drop becomes a liability.
* **Acquisition:** Limited to Gholdengo via level-up; it is not available as a TM or Move Tutor instruction for any other species.
