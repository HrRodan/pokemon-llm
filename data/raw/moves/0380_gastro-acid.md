## Identity & Mechanics
**Gastro Acid** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user regurgitates a corrosive slurry of concentrated digestive enzymes and stomach acids onto the opponent. This biological fluid douses the target, chemically neutralizing their natural traits and innate talents. This effectively suppresses the target's Ability, rendering it non-functional for as long as they remain active on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Disables the target's Ability. This suppression is unique as it is one of the few status conditions that is passed on via **Baton Pass**. It can target and successfully suppress almost all Abilities, including those that provide immunities (like Levitate or Flash Fire).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply suppression on hit).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility / Disruptor / Counter-Strategy.
* **Usage:** Gastro Acid serves as a niche but potent tool to dismantle "Ability-reliant" strategies. It is frequently used to strip away defensive crutches like **Wonder Guard** (Shedinja), **Levitate** (Eelektross/Rotom), or **Multiscale** (Dragonite). It also functions as a "Soft Check" to massive offensive threats by neutralizing Abilities like **Pure Power**, **Huge Power**, or **Libero/Protean**. While it lacks the immediate pressure of *Toxic*, it is often superior in Doubles formats to expose a partner's weakness.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it bypasses the standard Poison-type immunity of Steel-types, allowing the user to suppress the Abilities of Pokémon like **Corviknight** (Mirror Armor) or **Heatran** (Flash Fire).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Magic Coat** and **Magic Bounce** in certain generations; not blocked by typical elemental immunities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily found among Poison-types, gluttonous Pokémon, and biological organisms with acidic themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by defensive stalwarts like **Shuckle**, **Toxapex**, and **Amoonguss** to punish setup sweepers. It is also a staple on **Serperior** as a fast utility option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon like **Galvantula**, **Eelektross**, and **Cradily** to provide unique utility that disrupts opponents who expect standard offensive coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through Level Up; it has historically lacked wide availability as a TM or TR, making it a "specialist" move for specific team compositions.
