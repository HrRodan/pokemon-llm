## Identity & Mechanics
**Razor Leaf** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user launches a volley of sharp-edged, serrated leaves at the target with high velocity. The cutting nature of the foliage is designed to slice through defenses, often striking vital points for increased damage. As a multi-target attack in Double Battles, it acts as a flurry of blades hitting all adjacent opponents.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move has an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage), making it more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages and screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (High critical-hit ratio is a persistent mechanic).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Doubles/VGC).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 55, Accuracy 95%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Spread Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** While generally outclassed in high-level Singles by **Leaf Blade** (higher Power) or **Seed Bomb**, Razor Leaf serves as a vital early-to-mid-game progression move for Grass-type starters. In competitive formats, its "Slicing" attribute allows it to be boosted by the **Sharpness** ability, and its spread nature provides niche utility in VGC for breaking Focus Sashes across the board. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Sharpness-boosted (Slicing move); Non-contact; Physical.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among botanical and avian species (74 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to Grass-type starters across generations, including **Venusaur**, **Torterra**, **Meganium**, and **Decidueye** (both Alolan and Hisuian forms).
* **Competitive Utility:** Used by **Kartana** as a low-cost spread option and **Leavanny** or **Lurantis** to take advantage of slicing/critical-hit mechanics.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Grass types like **Farfetch’d** and **Wormadam (Plant Cloak)** to provide necessary type coverage against Rock and Water threats.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up; while not currently a TM in recent generations, it is a foundational move for nearly every Physical Grass-type evolution line.
