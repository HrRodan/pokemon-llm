## Identity & Mechanics
**Body Press** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user leverages its massive physical bulk, crushing the opponent by slamming its entire weight onto them. Unlike traditional physical attacks that rely on raw muscle power, this move converts the user's hardened exterior and kinetic energy into offensive force. It is the premier move for "defensive behemoths" to exert offensive pressure.
* **Effect:** Damage is calculated using the user's **Defense stat** instead of its Attack stat. This includes stat modifiers (e.g., boosts from Iron Defense or Cotton Guard).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Nuke / Setup Sweeper.
* **Usage:** Body Press revolutionized the competitive meta by allowing walls to become "Wallbreakers." It is almost always paired with **Iron Defense**, as boosting Defense simultaneously increases the user's survivability and the move's damage output. It effectively bypasses the "passive" nature of many high-defense Pokémon. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (182 learners), primarily given to Pokémon with high base Defense or massive frames.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Corviknight:** Uses it to punish Steel-type mirrors and deal heavy damage after an Iron Defense boost.
    * **Zamazenta (Crowned Shield):** Its signature competitive niche revolves around its massive Defense stat and STAB Body Press.
    * **Garganacl:** Often runs a "Iron Defense + Salt Cure + Body Press" set to become an unkillable late-game win condition.
    * **Archaludon:** Synergizes perfectly with its **Stamina** ability, which raises Defense when hit, naturally scaling Body Press damage mid-turn.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Ferrothorn**, **Snorlax**, and **Bastiodon** to provide crucial Fighting-type coverage against Dark and Steel types without requiring investment in their lower Attack stats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TR99** in Generation VIII and **TM089** in Generation IX, making it a staple across most competitive defensive builds.
