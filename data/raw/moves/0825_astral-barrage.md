## Identity & Mechanics
**Astral Barrage** is a Special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword and Shield - The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** The user manifests its overwhelming spectral power, summoning a relentless swarm of small, frightful ghosts to charge at the opposition. This move represents one of the most powerful Ghost-type manifestations in existence, saturating the battlefield with ethereal energy and spiritual entities to overwhelm the target's defenses.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive Special damage. In Double Battles, this move targets all adjacent opponents but does not damage the user's ally.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure Damage).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Power Spread Nuke / Premier Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Astral Barrage is widely considered one of the most oppressive moves in competitive Pokémon history, specifically in the Ubers and Restricted VGC formats. It completely outclasses **Shadow Ball** due to its significantly higher Base Power without sacrificing accuracy. While its PP is extremely limited, its ability to hit both opponents in Doubles without the damage reduction usually associated with spread moves being a major factor makes it a format-defining threat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; blocked by the ability **Bulletproof**; blocked by **Wide Guard** in Double Battles.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a unique Signature Move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Calyrex (Shadow Rider)**. It is the primary reason for Calyrex-S's dominance in high-level play.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not used as coverage on other Pokémon. However, it forces opposing teams to carry **Normal-types** (like Blissey or Porygon2) or **Dark-types** (like Yveltal or Incineroar) specifically to switch into this move.
* **Acquisition:** This is a signature move that cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to any other Pokémon. It is only accessible when Calyrex is fused with Spectrier using the Astral Glasses.
