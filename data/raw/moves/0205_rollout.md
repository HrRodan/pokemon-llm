## Identity & Mechanics
**Rollout** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user curls its body into a tight, spherical form and launches itself at the target, gaining momentum and centrifugal force with every rotation. This move builds kinetic energy over five consecutive turns; as the user tumbles faster, the impact becomes increasingly devastating. It is a signature "snowball" move famously associated with early-game difficulty spikes.
* **Effect:** The user is locked into Rollout for up to five turns. Each successful hit doubles the move's power (Base 30 -> 60 -> 120 -> 240 -> 480). The sequence ends immediately if the move misses, the target protects, or the 5-turn duration concludes.
* **Secondary Effect:** If the user has used **Defense Curl** previously while on the field, the base power of Rollout is doubled (starting at 60 instead of 30), allowing it to reach a theoretical maximum of 960 power on the final turn.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30 (Scaling), Accuracy 90%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Snowballing Sweeper / High-Risk Gimmick.
* **Usage:** Rollout is rarely seen in high-level competitive play due to the "lock-in" mechanic, which allows opponents to switch into a resistant **Steel, Ground, or Fighting-type** to safely wall the user or setup. It is primarily used in casual playthroughs (most notably Whitney’s Miltank) or in niche **Defense Curl** strategies. It hits **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types for **Super Effective** damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is susceptible to Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and King's Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution (209 learners), often given to Pokémon with round or sturdy physiologies.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Miltank**, **Golem**, and **Donphan**. It is also a staple for "rolling" Pokémon like **Whirlipede/Scolipede** and **Sandslash**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon such as **Typhlosion**, **Azumarill**, and **Electrode** to provide physical Rock-type coverage against Flying or Fire threats.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as **TM04** in Generation II. In modern generations, it is a common level-up move for early-game Rock and Ground types and frequently appears in "Move Reminder" lists.
