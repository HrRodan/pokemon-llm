## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Swap** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user weaves a complex psychic link between itself and the target, instantly synchronizing and then reversing their offensive momentum. By manipulating telekinetic energy, the user draws in the target's strength while projecting its own weaknesses onto the foe. This move is a tactical disruption tool designed to turn an opponent's offensive preparation against them.
* **Effect:** The user swaps its current **Attack and Special Attack stat modifiers** (stat stages) with the target. This includes both positive buffs (e.g., +2 from Swords Dance) and negative debuffs (e.g., -1 from Intimidate).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Status move).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Setup Punisher.
* **Usage:** Power Swap is primarily used as a niche counter to **Setup Sweepers**. Unlike *Haze*, which resets all stat changes for everyone on the field, Power Swap allows the user to **steal** the opponent's offensive boosts for itself while leaving the opponent with the user's potentially unboosted stats. It is particularly effective on fast, frail Psychic types that can outspeed a boosted threat to neutralize it. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **N/A** (Status move), but as a Psychic-type move, it fails against Dark-type Pokémon.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses protection moves like *Protect* in certain generations/formats (though generally blockable by standard means).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (75 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic-types and mystical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by high-tier Psychic threats such as **Mewtwo**, **Alakazam**, **Espeon**, and **Calyrex (Shadow/Ice Rider)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on tactical or defensive Pokémon like **Zamazenta**, **Tapu Koko**, and **Mr. Mime** to punish Physical or Special attackers who attempt to snowball.
* **Acquisition:** While it originated as a level-up or egg move for most, it gained wider accessibility as **TM70** in Pokémon Sword and Shield.
