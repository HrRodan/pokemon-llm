## Identity & Mechanics
**Burning Jealousy** is a **Special Fire-type** move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a searing wave of flame fueled by spite and envy. Visually manifesting as dark or greenish-hued fire, this move specifically targets the ambition of the opponent, punishing those who attempt to empower themselves during the heat of battle. Its energy is uniquely reactive to sudden shifts in an opponent's momentum.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and **guarantees a Burn** on any opposing Pokémon that has had its stats boosted during the same turn the move is used. This includes boosts from moves (like Dragon Dance or Flame Charge), Abilities (like Beast Boost), or Items (like Weakness Policy).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Burn (Conditional: only triggers if the target's stats were raised that turn).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Utility Punisher / Anti-Setup Coverage.
* **Usage:** Burning Jealousy serves as a specialized **Anti-Meta** tool. In Singles, it requires a hard read on an opponent's setup turn to be effective. However, it shines brightest in **VGC/Doubles**, where it acts as a "Spread Will-O-Wisp" that deals chip damage. It is particularly effective at neutering physical attackers who rely on Speed or Attack boosts to sweep. While it lacks the raw power of *Heat Wave* (95 BP) or the reliability of *Flamethrower*, its ability to bypass "Substitute" or "Protect" isn't there, but its psychological pressure against setup is immense. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; affected by Wide Guard; damage is reduced by 25% in Double Battles when hitting multiple targets.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (61 learners), primarily found among Fire-types, Ghost-types, and Pokémon associated with negative emotions.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Torkoal** (especially in Sun teams), **Incineroar**, and **Chandelure**. It is a staple on defensive or utility-oriented Fire types.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often carried by non-Fire types like **Grimmsnarl**, **Mimikyu**, and **Hisuian Zoroark**. These Pokémon use it as a "tech" move to punish Physical sweepers and provide much-needed Fire-type coverage against Steel-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Originally taught by the Move Tutor in the *Isle of Armor*; it remains available as a **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet* (The Teal Mask DLC).
