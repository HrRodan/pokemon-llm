## Identity & Mechanics
**Slash** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user attacks the target with sharp claws, blades, or talons to rip and tear through their defenses. The motion is swift and precise, designed to find weak points in the opponent's armor, resulting in a significantly increased likelihood of landing a critical hit.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage with an increased critical hit ratio (+1 stage, meaning a 12.5% chance to crit under standard conditions).
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Crit-Fishing Move.
* **Usage:** While Slash provides reliable accuracy, its 70 Power is generally considered mid-tier. In modern competitive play, it is often outclassed by **Body Slam** (for its 30% paralysis chance) or **Facade** (for its massive damage potential when the user is status-afflicted). However, it remains a staple for Pokémon with the **Super Luck** ability or those holding a **Scope Lens**, as the critical hit ignores the opponent's defensive stat boosts and Screens (Reflect).
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **neutral damage** to most types but is **resisted by Rock and Steel**, and **Ghost** types are immune to it. It does not hit any type for Super Effective damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (167 learners), primarily given to Pokémon with visible claws, scythes, or sharp appendages.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard**, **Sandslash**, **Scyther/Scizor**, and **Zacian**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on Physical attackers like **Garchomp** or **Feraligatr** during the leveling process, though it is rarely chosen for high-level coverage due to the lack of Super Effective pressure.
* **Acquisition:** While not a common TM in recent generations, it is a ubiquitous **Level-Up move** for almost any Pokémon with a "slashing" physical profile.
