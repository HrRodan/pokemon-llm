## Identity & Mechanics
**Electric Terrain** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user electrifies the ground under all active Pokémon for five turns, creating a crackling field of high-voltage static. This humming energy prevents grounded Pokémon from falling asleep and stimulates the nervous systems of those touching the floor, significantly boosting the potency of Electric-type attacks.
* **Effect:** For five turns, the battlefield is covered in Electric Terrain. This prevents any grounded Pokémon (those not Flying-type or possessing the Levitate ability) from being afflicted by the Sleep status condition or using the move Rest. Furthermore, the power of Electric-type moves used by grounded Pokémon is increased by 1.5×. It also changes the move *Nature Power* into *Thunderbolt*.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Field Effect).
* **Targeting:** Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility / Field Enabler / Setup.
* **Usage:** Primarily used to disrupt "Sleep-spam" strategies (such as Spore or Dark Void) and to provide a massive damage multiplier for Electric-type wallbreakers. In higher tiers, it is often set automatically by abilities like **Electric Surge** or **Hadron Engine**. It is a cornerstone for "Terrain Teams," providing a **1.5× Power Boost** to Electric moves, making STAB-boosted attacks like Thunderbolt or Rising Voltage devastating. It deals **Super Effective** damage indirectly by boosting moves against **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Terrain Effect; bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; cleared by Ice Spinner or Defog.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (103 learners), especially among Electric-type species and robotic/technological Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Tapu Koko** and **Pincurchin** (via Electric Surge) and **Miraidon** (via Hadron Engine). Manual setters include **Raichu-Alola**, **Zekrom**, and **Zapdos**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mew** or **Blissey** in specific formats to provide team-wide sleep immunity or to support Paradox Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it accessible to almost all Electric-types and many mechanical Pokémon like **Iron Hands** and **Iron Valiant** to trigger their **Quark Drive** ability.
