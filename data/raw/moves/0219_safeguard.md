## Identity & Mechanics
**Safeguard** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user creates a protective, mystical veil that surrounds its entire side of the field. This shimmering barrier acts as a shield against debilitating conditions, preventing the user and its allies from being afflicted by major status ailments or falling into a state of confusion.
* **Effect:** Protects all Pokémon on the user’s side of the field from major status effects (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) and confusion for five turns. It does not cure pre-existing conditions. Notably, if *Yawn* is used while Safeguard is active, the drowsy effect will fail immediately. However, it does not prevent self-inflicted confusion from moves like *Outrage*, *Petal Dance*, or *Thrash*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. It is a field-state modifier.
* **Targeting:** User's Side (Affects all allies in Doubles/Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Stall.
* **Usage:** Safeguard is primarily used as a preventative measure against "Status Spam" or "Stall" archetypes that rely on *Toxic* or *Will-O-Wisp* to wear down teams. In VGC and Double Battles, it serves as a vital tool to block *Spore* or *Dark Void*. While often outclassed by **Misty Terrain** (which provides similar protection plus a Dragon-type damage reduction), Safeguard has the advantage of not being overridden by other Terrains and persisting even if the user switches out. It is countered by **Defog**, which removes the barrier.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; affected by *Prankster*; removed by *Defog*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (344 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on bulky supportive Pokémon and Legendaries such as **Lugia**, **Cresselia**, **Blissey**, and **Ninetales (including Alolan Ninetales)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often carried by Dragon-types like **Dragonite** and **Latios** to prevent them from being crippled by Burn (which halves Physical attack) or Paralysis (which ruins their Speed).
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in almost every generation since its debut, ensuring most defensive-oriented Pokémon can access it.
