## Identity & Mechanics
**Ice Spinner** is a physical Ice-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user coats its feet in a layer of jagged, thin ice and performs a rapid, whirling pirouette, slamming into the target with freezing centrifugal force. This spinning motion creates a localized vortex that physically shatters and clears the battlefield of any active Terrain.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and immediately removes the effects of Electric Terrain, Grassy Terrain, Misty Terrain, or Psychic Terrain from the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to remove Terrain upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Utility Coverage.**
* **Usage:** Ice Spinner is the gold standard for physical Ice-type consistency. It is preferred over **Icicle Crash** (85 Power/90 Accuracy) by players who value 100% accuracy, and it completely outclasses **Ice Punch** (75 Power). Its ability to destroy Terrain makes it a dedicated **hard counter to Terrain-reliant strategies**, such as Psychic Terrain (Indeedee-F + Armarouge) or Grassy Terrain (Rillaboom). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Flying, Ground, Grass, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (74 learners), serving as a vital tool for many physical attackers that previously lacked reliable Ice-type options.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-tier threats like **Chien-Pao**, **Weavile**, and **Cetitan** as a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often equipped by non-Ice types such as **Great Tusk**, **Dragonite**, and **Quaquaval** to provide crucial coverage against 4x Ice-weak targets like Landorus-T or Garchomp, while simultaneously disrupting opposing field conditions.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM124** in Generation IX, making it accessible to a vast array of Pokémon that can learn moves via technical machines.
