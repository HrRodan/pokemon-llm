## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Claw** is a physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user slashes the target with sharp, huge claws imbued with draconic energy. This move represents a straightforward physical assault, focusing on precision and speed rather than raw, uncontrollable power. It is frequently associated with predatory Dragon-types and Pokémon with prominent talons or claws.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Dragon Claw serves as the primary "safe" physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for Dragon-type physical attackers. While it lacks the explosive power of **Outrage** (120 BP), it avoids the drawback of being locked into a move or becoming confused. In VGC and Doubles formats, it is often preferred over Outrage to allow for switching and target flexibility. It deals **Super Effective** damage specifically to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Strength Sap. In Generation IX, it is notably boosted by the **Sharpness** ability (e.g., on Hisuian Samurott via Metronome/Copycat or other slashing-based attackers), increasing its damage by 50%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (110 learners), making it the standard physical coverage for many clawed creatures.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Garchomp**, **Dragonite**, **Haxorus**, and **Salamence**. It is also a signature-style move for **Mega Charizard X**, benefiting from the Tough Claws ability.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon Pokémon such as **Charizard**, **Tyranitar**, **Feraligatr**, and **Krookodile** to provide neutral coverage against most of the roster or to specifically snipe opposing Dragon-types.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM02** (traditionally) or **TM078** in Generation IX. It has been a TM or TR in almost every generation since its debut in the Hoenn region.
