## Identity & Mechanics
**Belch** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user releases a concentrated, nauseating cloud of toxic gas or stomach acids at the target. This move is unique in that it is physically impossible to execute unless the user has first consumed a Berry during the battle. Once the gastric requirement is met, the user can emit this high-pressure toxic blast repeatedly, regardless of switching out.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage only if the user has eaten a Berry since the start of the battle. This includes eating a held Berry (via HP drop or Harvest), stealing one via Bug Bite or Pluck, or being hit by a Fling Berry. Once "unlocked," the move remains usable for the rest of the match.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Setup-Dependent Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Belch is a high-reward STAB option for Poison-types that can reliably trigger their own items. It is significantly more powerful than the standard **Sludge Bomb** (90 BP) or **Sludge Wave** (95 BP), but its reliance on Berry consumption makes it inconsistent. It is most effective on "Gluttony" ability users or Pokémon running "Chesto-Resto" strategies. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses "Bulletproof" (unlike Sludge Bomb); blocked by "Soundproof" in some contexts (though not classified as a sound move, it is often grouped thematically with shout-based moves).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily concentrated among Poison-types, gluttonous mammals, and "unclean" themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Toxtricity** (frequently paired with Throat Spray or berries), **Galarian Weezing**, and **Guzzlord**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Snorlax** or **Greedent**; these Pokémon utilize the **Gluttony** ability to consume berries early (at 50% HP), turning Belch into a surprise high-power coverage move against Fairy-type switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up or as an Egg Move; it is notably absent from TM/TR lists in several generations, making its distribution more exclusive to its natural learners.
