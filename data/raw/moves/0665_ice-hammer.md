## Identity & Mechanics
**Ice Hammer** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user focuses intense cryogenic energy into its limb, swinging a heavy, frost-shattered fist to crush the target. The sheer weight and frigid momentum of the strike are so immense that they physically tax the user, causing a noticeable drop in movement capability. This move is characterized by high impact and thematic associations with brute strength and sub-zero temperatures.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and lowers the user’s Speed by one stage (100% chance).
* **Secondary Effect:** Guaranteed -1 Speed drop to the user upon successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Wallbreaker / Trick Room Utility.
* **Usage:** Ice Hammer serves as an Ice-type clone of *Hammer Arm*. While it boasts higher base power than reliable options like *Ice Punch* or *Icicle Crash*, its accuracy and speed-lowering side effect make it niche. It is most effective on **Trick Room** teams, where the Speed drop actually allows the user to "speed up" relative to the field. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Flying, Ground, Grass, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning it receives a 20% power boost from the ability **Iron Fist**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 evolutionary lines).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily the signature-style move for **Crabominable**, which benefits from the STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and potential *Iron Fist* boost. It is also learned by the **Tinkatink** line (Tinkatink, Tinkatuff, and Tinkaton).
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Tinkaton**, it provides rare Ice-type physical coverage to threaten Ground and Flying-type checks that normally resist its Steel-type STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor in any generation, restricted entirely to natural level-up or move reminder pools for its specific learners.
