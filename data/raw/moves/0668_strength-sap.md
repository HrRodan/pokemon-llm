## Identity & Mechanics
**Strength Sap** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user siphons the physical vitality of the target to replenish its own life force. Visually, the user drains the opponent's "strength," manifesting as a specialized recovery technique that simultaneously weakens the foe's muscles or physical output. This move is a premier tool for defensive Pokémon to punish high-Attack opponents.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack stat by one stage. The user then restores its HP by an amount equal to the target’s actual Attack stat (calculated *before* the reduction from this move, but including other active modifiers like Choice Band or Burn). The move fails if the target's Attack is already at -6.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target's Attack stat.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Sustain / Anti-Physical Utility.
* **Usage:** Strength Sap is considered one of the most powerful recovery moves in the game when facing physical attackers. Unlike *Recover* or *Roost*, which heal a fixed 50%, Strength Sap can potentially heal a Pokémon from 1% to 100% HP in a single turn if the opponent has a high Attack stat. It serves as a hard **Check** to physical "Wallbreakers" and "Sweepers." Its main drawback is "diminishing returns": as the target's Attack drops from repeated use, the healing amount decreases. It is also less effective against Special Attackers with low base Attack.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is ineffective against Pokémon with the **Sap Sipper** ability, who will absorb the move to raise their own Attack.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses *Substitute* in some generations; blocked by *Good as Gold* or *Magic Bounce*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (19 learners), primarily concentrated among Grass-types and Ghost-types.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Galarian Corsola:** Used this move to become a premier Eviolite wall in Gen VIII, effectively neutering physical attackers while staying healthy.
    * **Sinistcha:** A modern Gen IX user that utilizes the move alongside its unique typing to act as a pivot.
    * **Vileplume/Bellossom:** Traditional Grass-types that gained this move to increase their longevity in lower competitive tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Ghost-types like **Polteageist** or **Drifblim**. For Polteageist, it provides a way to survive priority physical hits (like Sucker Punch) while setting up *Shell Smash*.
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is not a common TM/TR and is usually learned via level-up or as an Egg Move.
