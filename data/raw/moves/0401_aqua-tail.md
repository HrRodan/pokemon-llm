## Identity & Mechanics
**Aqua Tail** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user lashingly rotates its body to strike the target with a tail wreathed in high-pressure water. This aquatic strike mimics the crushing force of a vicious wave in a raging storm, utilizing the user's physical strength and momentum to deliver a heavy blow.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target. It does not possess any innate secondary effects or stat-modifying properties.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Power Physical STAB / Coverage Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Aqua Tail serves as a middle-ground between the high-reliability/low-power **Waterfall** (80 BP) and the high-risk **Hydro Pump** (Special). In competitive formats, it is often chosen by Physical attackers who require slightly more "oomph" than Waterfall to secure specific OHKOs or 2HKOs, though the 10% miss chance makes it a riskier consistency option. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Despite the name, it is not currently classified as a "Pulse" or "Slicing" move, though it is fundamentally a tail-based attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (164 learners), particularly among reptilian, draconic, and aquatic Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Gyarados**, **Feraligatr**, **Swampert**, and the legendary **Palkia**. It is also a signature-style move for the **Palafin** and **Dondozo** lines in recent generations.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a vital coverage option on non-Water Pokémon such as **Dragonite**, **Garchomp**, and **Tyranitar**. These Pokémon use Aqua Tail to lure in and punish Ground and Rock-type checks that would otherwise wall their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** While often learned via level-up by aquatic species, it is widely accessible to a vast array of Pokémon through **Move Tutors** (in Gen 4-7) and **TR/TM** technical machines in modern generations.
