## Identity & Mechanics
**Triple Arrows** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user executes a high-impact sequence, starting with a powerful axe kick to stun the target followed immediately by a rapid-fire volley of three arrows. This combination of martial arts and archery represents the unique combat style of the Hisuian frontier. The move is designed to overwhelm the opponent's guard through sheer pressure and precision.
* **Effect:** A high-utility offensive move that provides multiple beneficial secondary effects. In its most recent competitive iteration, it possesses an increased critical hit ratio (+1 stage). 
* **Secondary Effect:** It has a **50% chance** to lower the target's Defense stat by one stage and a **30% chance** to cause the target to flinch.
* **Targeting:** Selected-pokemon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Stat-Breaker / Utility Nuke.
* **Usage:** Triple Arrows is an exceptionally "loaded" move, offering better utility than standard Fighting-type options like *Close Combat* or *Drain Punch*. While it has slightly lower base power than Close Combat, it carries no defensive penalties for the user and actively softens the target for subsequent hits. It is a premier **Stallbreaker** tool, as the 50% Defense drop and high crit rate allow the user to bypass defensive walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is considered a **Slicing** move (benefiting from Sharpness) in some contexts and features an increased Critical Hit ratio.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), functioning as a Signature Move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Hisuian Decidueye**. The move defines the Pokémon's competitive niche, allowing it to pressure switches with potential flinches and Defense drops while benefiting from its STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, this move is not available to any non-Fighting Pokémon. Its presence is a "check" against Heavy-Duty Boots users and Steel-type walls like **Corviknight** or **Kingambit**, where the Defense drops can force a switch.
* **Acquisition:** This is a signature move and is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for other Pokémon; it is learned upon evolution or via the Move Reminder for Hisuian Decidueye.
