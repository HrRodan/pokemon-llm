## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Punch** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user manifests a spectral fist composed of concentrated shadow energy, launching an inescapable strike from the darkness. Because the punch emerges directly from the target's own shadow, it bypasses the physical need for line-of-sight, making it a "never-miss" phantom strike that ignores environmental hazards or magical shifts in visibility.
* **Effect:** This move ignores all changes to the user's Accuracy and the target's Evasion stages. It will hit even if the target has used moves like Double Team or Minimize.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy ∞%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Evasion Counter.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low for a Physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, its utility lies in its perfect accuracy. It is primarily used to shut down "Evasion Spam" strategies (Double Team/Minimize) or to ensure a hit when affected by accuracy-lowering moves like Mud-Slap or Sand Attack. It is often compared to **Shadow Claw**, which offers higher power and a critical-hit ratio, but lacks the guaranteed hit mechanic. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning its power is increased by 20% (to 72 BP) when used by a Pokémon with the **Iron Fist** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, naturally learned by only 10 Pokémon species.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Ghost-types such as **Gengar**, **Dusknoir**, and **Golurk** are the primary practitioners of this move. 
* **Coverage Utility:** **Golurk** is a standout user, as its *Iron Fist* ability provides a necessary power boost, turning Shadow Punch into a more viable reliable STAB option. The Mythical Pokémon **Marshadow** also utilizes it as a thematic Physical Ghost attack.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is highly restricted; it is not available as a TM or TR in most generations, typically requiring level-up or specific Move Tutor access.
