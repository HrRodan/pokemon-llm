## Identity & Mechanics
**Shell Side Arm** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user fires a concentrated burst of poisonous fluid from the Shellder clamped onto its arm. This move is highly sophisticated, involving a "smart" targeting system where the user identifies the target's defensive weaknesses. It dynamically calculates whether a physical or special strike will inflict more damage, making it an unpredictable and versatile offensive tool.
* **Effect:** This move deals damage. It compares the target's Defense and Special Defense stats against the user's Attack and Special Attack stats to determine which damage category (Physical or Special) will result in the highest damage output.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to **Poison** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Adaptive Wallbreaker** / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Shell Side Arm serves as a more advanced version of moves like *Psyshock*. While *Psyshock* always targets physical defense using the special attack stat, Shell Side Arm is truly adaptive, allowing the user to punish "Pink Blobs" (Blissey/Chansey) by hitting their paper-thin Defense, or melt physically defensive Steel/Flying types by hitting their Special Defense. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is non-contact. Despite its name suggesting "arm" contact, it is treated as a projectile-based special move for the purposes of calculation.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Galarian Slowbro**. This move defines Galarian Slowbro's niche in the competitive meta, allowing it to function as a mixed threat without requiring split EV investment.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Galarian Slowbro, its primary utility is providing a high-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option that prevents the user from being walled by traditional special sponges. It is particularly effective at forcing out **Clefable**, **Tapu Fini**, and **Rillaboom**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned by Galarian Slowbro immediately upon evolving from Galarian Slowpoke via the Galarica Cuff.
