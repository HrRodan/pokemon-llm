## Identity & Mechanics
**Fairy Wind** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user summons a mystical, shimmering breeze infused with pink energy and magical particles, buffeting the opponent with a gentle but enchanted gale. It serves as a foundational Fairy-type offensive move, often being the first elemental STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option many Fairy Pokémon learn.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional properties.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game Progression Move / Low-Power STAB.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Fairy Wind is strictly outclassed by more powerful options like **Moonblast** (95 Power) or **Dazzling Gleam** (80 Power). Its primary utility is during the "main story" playthroughs where it provides reliable, accurate damage before more potent Fairy-type moves are unlocked. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Fighting, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; does not trigger abilities like Static or Rough Skin. It is not sound-based and cannot be blocked by Bulletproof.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (38 learners), primarily restricted to natural Fairy-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized as a starting move by **Sylveon**, **Tinkaton**, and **Clefairy**. It is iconic to the **Flabébé** and **Cottonee** evolutionary lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-pure Fairy Pokémon such as **Jumpluff** or **Galarian Weezing** during early levels to check early-game Dark or Fighting-type threats. 
* **Acquisition:** Exclusively learned via **Leveling Up**; it has historically not been available as a TM or TR, reinforcing its status as a developmental move for young Pokémon.
