## Identity & Mechanics
**Strange Steam** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user exhales or emits a blast of peculiar, shimmering, multicolored vapor toward the target. This mystical steam is infused with strange properties that can disorient the opponent's senses upon contact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular special damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20% chance** to cause **Confusion** in the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Signature STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) / Disruptive Utility.
* **Usage:** Strange Steam serves as a unique alternative to *Moonblast*. While it has slightly lower power (90 vs 95) and lower accuracy (95% vs 100%) compared to Moonblast, it compensates with a significantly higher secondary effect chance (20% Confusion vs 30% Special Attack drop). It is used primarily to pressure switch-ins by threatening a status condition that can force further switches. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move. Despite the name "Steam," it is not currently categorized as a "pulse" or "ball/bomb" move, nor does it interact with the *Steam Engine* ability like Fire-type moves.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, functioning as a signature move with only **1** total learner.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, this move is the signature move of **Galarian Weezing**. It reflects the Pokémon's unique Fairy/Poison typing and its thematic role as a "living factory" that purifies or alters gases.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Galarian Weezing, it is never seen as a coverage option on other Pokémon. For Galarian Weezing, it is the primary Special Fairy-type attack of choice.
* **Acquisition:** Galarian Weezing learns this move upon evolution or via level-up; it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor teaching in any generation.
