## Identity & Mechanics
**Ice Burn** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user gathers an immense amount of frigid energy on the first turn, manifesting as a swirling vortex of ultracold air and shimmering frost. On the second turn, it unleashes a devastating blast of cryo-kinetic energy that is so intensely cold it inflicts thermal shock similar to a high-temperature burn. This move serves as the signature thematic bridge between the freezing power of Kyurem and the fiery essence of Reshiram.
* **Effect:** The user charges for one turn before attacking on the second. If the user is holding a **Power Herb**, the move executes instantly.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Burn** the target. This is highly unique as it is an Ice-type move capable of inflicting a status condition usually reserved for Fire-type attacks.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Ice Burn is primarily used as a tactical "nuke" to bypass specially defensive walls. While its two-turn requirement makes it predictable, the 140 Base Power coming off a legendary Special Attack stat is often enough to OHKO (One-Hit Knock Out) neutral targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types. Compared to *Ice Beam*, it offers significantly more power but less reliability; compared to its physical counterpart *Freeze Shock*, it is generally considered superior due to the high Special Attack of its primary user.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact, Special Attack. Not blocked by most common defensive abilities except those specifically mitigating Ice damage (like Thick Fat).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of a specific legendary fusion (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kyurem-White**. It represents the fusion of Kyurem's Ice typing with Reshiram's fiery influence.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to a single Legendary Pokémon, it is not seen as coverage on other archetypes. However, for Kyurem-White, it serves as a massive STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option that punishes physical attackers with a high 30% burn rate if they survive the initial hit.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor. It is learned automatically by **Kyurem** when it transforms into its **White Kyurem** form via the DNA Splicers.
