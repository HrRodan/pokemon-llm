## Identity & Mechanics
**Aromatic Mist** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user releases a soothing, fragrant pink mist that envelops an ally, calming their nerves and sharpening their mental focus. This mysterious aroma provides a protective layer against supernatural and elemental assaults, reinforcing the target's spiritual resilience.
* **Effect:** Raises a selected ally’s Special Defense stat by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% success rate on valid targets).
* **Targeting:** Ally (Specifically designed for Doubles/Triples/Battle Royale formats; fails if used in a Single Battle unless targeting the user in very specific, rare circumstances, though standard mechanics dictate it must target an ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Support / Doubles Utility.
* **Usage:** Aromatic Mist is a niche **Cleric/Support** move exclusively valuable in VGC and Doubles formats. Unlike *Light Screen*, which provides a global 50% damage reduction for five turns, Aromatic Mist provides a permanent stat stage boost that can be further increased or passed via *Psych Up*. It is often overshadowed by *Light Screen* or moves that boost the user (like *Calm Mind*), but it excels when paired with a "Raid Boss" partner—a high-HP Pokémon that becomes nearly unbreakable once its Special Defense is boosted.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (never misses). It is not affected by *Protect* if used by an ally, but it can be redirected by *Follow Me* or *Rage Powder* if those users are also considered valid allies in certain formats.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (17 learners), primarily restricted to Fairy-types and "aromatic" botanical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently associated with **Aromatisse** (its thematic signature), **Alcremie**, and the Legendary **Tapu Lele**. It is also utilized by the **Hatterene** line in supportive Trick Room sets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Seen on non-Fairy Pokémon like **Tsareena** and **Vespiquen**, who can use it in doubles to bolster a partner's longevity while maintaining offensive pressure themselves. 
* **Acquisition:** Highly restricted; it is almost never available via **TM/TR** and must be learned through natural leveling or as an Egg Move in specific breeding chains.
