## Identity & Mechanics
**Superpower** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user unleashes its entire physical reservoir in a single, devastating strike of overwhelming force. This immense exertion of strength is visually depicted as a heavy-impact tackle or punch that radiates raw energy. However, the sheer strain of the maneuver leaves the user’s muscles fatigued and their guard lowered, resulting in immediate physical exhaustion.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant physical damage. Immediately following the attack, the user’s **Attack** and **Defense** stats are lowered by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's own stats (Self-Debuff).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Superpower is a high-reward move often used by Pokémon that require immediate, heavy-hitting Fighting-type coverage but lack access to *Close Combat*. Unlike *Close Combat*, which lowers both defensive stats, Superpower lowers Attack, making it poorly suited for "sweeping" but excellent for **Hit-and-Run** tactics or forcing a KO before switching out. It is famously paired with the Ability **Contrary** (e.g., Malamar), transforming the debuffs into Attack and Defense boosts.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (218 learners), appearing frequently as a Move Tutor or TR move.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Landorus-Therian**, which uses it to muscle through Steel-types; **Scizor**, which utilizes it for high-base-power neutral coverage; and **Melmetal**, which leverages its massive Attack stat for a nearly unshakeable "nuke."
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Azumarill** (utilizing Huge Power) to break through Ferrothorn, or **Dragonite** and **Tyranitar** to surprise Steel-type checks.
* **Contrary Synergy:** **Malamar** and **Lurantis** are specialized users who use Superpower as a setup move, gaining +1 Attack and +1 Defense with every hit.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (such as TR39 in Sword/Shield) and consistently featured as a high-tier **Move Tutor** option in older titles.
