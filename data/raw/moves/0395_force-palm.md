## Identity & Mechanics
**Force Palm** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user delivers a concentrated, open-handed thrust that releases a powerful shock wave into the target's body. This strike is designed to disrupt the opponent's nervous system through internal kinetic impact, creating a visible burst of energy upon contact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a high **30%** chance to inflict **Paralysis**, making it a potent tool for speed control.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility STAB / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low compared to heavy hitters like *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick*, Force Palm acts as the Fighting-type equivalent of *Body Slam*. It is primarily used by bulky attackers or early-game evolutions to fish for paralysis. In higher-tier play, it is generally overshadowed by *Drain Punch* for recovery or *Mach Punch* for priority, though it remains a niche option for Pokémon that need to cripple faster switch-ins. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like *Rough Skin* or *Iron Barbs*, and it benefits from the **Iron Fist** ability boost.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (15 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with martial arts themes or large palms.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Lucario** and **Hariyama** lines, often serving as their primary STAB move during the mid-game. It is also a signature-style move for the "Mushroom Warrior" **Breloom**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by high-tier Paradox and Legendary Pokémon such as **Iron Hands**, **Okidogi**, and **Marshadow** as a reliable way to spread status while maintaining offensive pressure. 
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is almost exclusively learned via **Level Up** and has historically lacked **TM/TR** status, making its distribution much tighter than other Fighting-type moves.
