## Identity & Mechanics
**Follow Me** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user performs a distracting gesture, making itself the center of attention on the battlefield. By acting as a focal point, the user forces all single-target attacks from opposing Pokémon to be redirected toward itself, effectively shielding its ally from harm. This move is a cornerstone of doubles-format strategy, often flavored as a playful or provocative taunt that foes cannot ignore.
* **Effect:** Until the end of the turn, any move targeted at the user's ally by an opponent will instead strike the user. This redirection applies to most single-target moves but does not affect moves that hit multiple targets (spread moves). This effect takes priority over the redirection abilities **Lightning Rod** and **Storm Drain**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Affects the entire field's targeting logic).
* **Priority:** +2 (Ensures it activates before most standard attacks).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Premier Redirection Support / Utility.
* **Usage:** Follow Me is arguably the most influential support move in VGC (Doubles) history. Its primary function is to protect a "Glass Cannon" or a setup sweeper (e.g., a Pokémon using **Belly Drum** or **Shell Smash**) by absorbing incoming hits. It deals no damage directly, so it has no **Super Effective** profile, but it is used to neutralize threats to teammates.
* **Context:** It is the direct rival to **Rage Powder**. However, Follow Me is strictly superior because Rage Powder (a powder-based move) is ignored by Grass-types, Pokémon with the Overcoat ability, or those holding Safety Goggles. Follow Me has no such type-based immunities.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; Priority +2 allows it to outpace most moves except extreme priority like Fake Out or Helping Hand.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow and specialized distribution (24 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Clefairy** (utilizing Eviolite and the Friend Guard ability for maximum survivability), **Togekiss** (a bulky redirection pivot), and **Indeedee-Female** (which pairs redirection with Psychic Terrain to block opposing priority).
* **VGC Staples:** **Maushold** has recently become a premier user, combining Follow Me with the Friend Guard ability. Additionally, **Ogerpon** (in several of its Mask forms) utilizes Follow Me to provide high-speed redirection support.
* **Coverage Utility:** While traditionally found on Normal and Fairy types, it is occasionally seen on **Riolu** or **Lucario** to facilitate "Prankster" or "Inner Focus" support strategies. 
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is highly restricted. It is rarely a TM or TR, usually requiring specific leveling or being part of a signature/limited movepool for supportive archetypes.
