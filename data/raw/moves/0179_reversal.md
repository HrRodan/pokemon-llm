## Identity & Mechanics
**Reversal** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user taps into a surge of desperate energy, delivering a powerful counter-attack that grows more devastating as the user's stamina wanes. It is the ultimate "last stand" maneuver, visually depicted as a frantic, high-velocity strike performed when the user is on the brink of fainting.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The base power is determined by the ratio of the user's remaining HP to its maximum HP. At full health, the move is negligible, but at 1 HP (specifically less than 2% HP), it reaches a massive **200 Base Power**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies 20–200], Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Clutch Finisher.**
* **Usage:** Reversal is the cornerstone of the "Endure-Reversal" (EndureRev) strategy. By using the move **Endure** or holding a **Focus Sash**, a Pokémon can survive a hit with exactly 1 HP, allowing them to retaliate with a 200 BP STAB move. While **Close Combat** is generally preferred for its consistency, Reversal offers higher peak damage without the defensive drops, provided the user can maintain low HP safely. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Rock, Steel, Ice, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (**242 learners**), as many Pokémon are capable of a "last stand."
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Lucario**, **Blaziken**, and **Cinderace**, who leverage their high Speed to ensure they move first once they have reached the 1 HP threshold. **Annihilape** and **Primeape** also utilize it effectively due to their aggressive stat spreads.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on fast Physical attackers like **Haxorus**, **Sneasler**, and **Lycanroc** to provide a massive power ceiling that can OHKO even the sturdiest Steel or Normal-type walls (like Blissey or Aggron) when the attacker is weakened.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM or TR** in modern generations (including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), making it a common tech option for competitive teams.
