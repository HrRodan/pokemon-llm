## Identity & Mechanics
**Outrage** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user rampages with overwhelming draconic fury, thrashing blindly at the opposition for two to three turns. This high-intensity assault is exhaustive; once the rampage concludes, the user becomes confused due to the sheer mental and physical strain of the outburst. In a retrieval context, this move is defined by its "lock-in" mechanic and high-risk, high-reward output.
* **Effect:** The user is forced to use Outrage for 2–3 turns. During this period, the user cannot select other moves or switch out manually. After the final turn of the rampage, the user becomes Confused.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to inflict **Confusion** on the user after the sequence ends. Note: Safeguard does not prevent this self-induced confusion.
* **Targeting:** Random Opponent (In Single Battles, this targets the lone foe; in Double Battles, it targets a random adjacent opponent each turn).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Outrage is the premier Physical Dragon-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for offensive threats. While **Dragon Claw** is preferred for consistency and safety, Outrage is used to secure OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) on bulky neutral targets. However, it is highly exploitable in modern competitive play (Gen 6+); if a **Fairy-type** Pokémon switches into an Outrage, the move is neutralized immediately, and the user is locked into a resisted or immune interaction, often leading to a forced loss of momentum.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types. It is resisted by **Steel** and has no effect on **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (219 learners), primarily granted to Dragon-types and aggressive physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Dragonite**, **Garchomp**, **Salamence**, **Rayquaza**, and **Baxcalibur**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a powerful coverage or "neutral nuke" on non-Dragon Pokémon such as **Arcanine**, **Gyarados**, **Tyranitar**, and **Feraligatr** to muscle through neutral resists.
* **Acquisition:** It is a staple of move tutors and has been consistently available as a **TM** or **TR** (such as TR24 in Gen 8 or TM156 in Gen 9) across multiple generations.
