## Identity & Mechanics
**Catastropika** is a physical Electric-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** As Pikachu's ultimate signature Z-Move, the Pokémon gathers an immense overflow of yellow electrical energy, surrounding its entire body in a massive, crackling sphere of high-voltage current. Using its Z-Power to reach maximum output, Pikachu pounces and launches itself as a living projectile, crashing into the target with explosive, crushing force.
* **Effect:** This is a high-intensity finisher that deals massive physical damage. As a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy checks, meaning it cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig). To use this move, a Pikachu must hold a **Pikanium Z** and have **Volt Tackle** in its move set.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure Damage).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 210, Accuracy --%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Catastropika is the single most powerful Electric-type physical attack in the series. It is used as a "one-time delete button" to bypass Pikachu's natural fragility by securing a guaranteed OHKO on a neutral or resisted threat. It is strictly superior to the generic Electric Z-Move, *Gigavolt Havoc* (which maxes out at 190 power when based on Volt Tackle). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Contact (triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a species-specific signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Only **Pikachu** can utilize this move. It is often seen on "Light Ball" style offensive sets in Generation VII formats where the Z-Crystal replaces the item to provide immediate wallbreaking potential.
* **Coverage Utility:** While exclusive to Pikachu, it is used specifically to break through bulky neutral walls such as **Clefable** or **Mew**, or to over-kill traditional counters like **Toxapex** and **Celesteela**.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not learned through leveling or TMs. It is accessed only when a Pikachu holding **Pikanium Z** converts its **Volt Tackle** into the Z-Move during battle. In the Alola region, the crystal is obtained from a woman in Konikoni City.
