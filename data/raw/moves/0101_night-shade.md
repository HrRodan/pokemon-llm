## Identity & Mechanics
**Night Shade** is a Special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user manifests a frightening, illusory shadow or a mirage that looms over the target. This spectral projection ignores the target's physical and special durability, directly draining their vitality through a dark, shimmering haze.
* **Effect:** Inflicts fixed damage exactly equal to the user’s current level. In standard competitive play (Level 50 or 100), this provides a guaranteed, predictable damage output.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it ignores all type-effectiveness multipliers (Resistance/Weakness), though **Normal-type Pokémon** remain immune to the move.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A - Level Dependent], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Fixed-Damage Chip / Utility.**
* **Usage:** Night Shade is a premier choice for defensive Pokémon or supports with lackluster offensive stats. Since it bypasses defensive stat boosts (like Calm Mind or Iron Defense), it is an effective tool for "chipping" away at bulky walls. Its primary rival is **Seismic Toss**; while Seismic Toss is blocked by Ghosts, Night Shade is blocked by Normal-types. It is often preferred on Ghost-types to ensure they can damage other Ghosts.
* **Type Matchups:** Deals neutral damage to all types except **Normal**, which has a natural immunity. It does **not** deal Super Effective damage due to its fixed-damage nature.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses most protection abilities except those affecting Ghost-type targeting.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (120 learners), primarily found among Ghost, Psychic, and Dark-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by defensive staples such as **Dusclops**, **Sableye**, and **Galarian Corsola**, who rely on it for consistent damage while focusing their EVs on bulk.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on high-speed utility leads like **Gengar** or **Froslass** to ensure a specific amount of damage before fainting, or on **Alakazam** in specific historical metas to bypass special sponges.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in various generations, including the most recent Scarlet & Violet (TM042).
