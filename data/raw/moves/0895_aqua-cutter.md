## Identity & Mechanics
**Aqua Cutter** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user expels a jet of highly pressurized water, shaping it into a razor-sharp blade that slashes the opponent with surgical precision. This pressurized stream is capable of cutting through solid objects, making it a "Slicing" move characterized by its high-speed delivery and lethal accuracy.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and possesses an increased critical-hit ratio (Stage 1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (though it benefits significantly from the **Sharpness** ability, which boosts its power by 50%).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Synergy Move.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than *Waterfall* (80) or *Liquidation* (85), Aqua Cutter is the preferred choice for Pokémon with the **Sharpness** ability, effectively boosting its power to 105. Its high critical-hit ratio also makes it a strong choice for sets utilizing *Scope Lens* or *Focus Energy* to bypass defensive stat boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Slicing Move**, meaning it is boosted by Sharpness and interacts with certain defensive abilities like *Sharpness* (though defensively it doesn't trigger *Rocky Helmet* as it does not make physical contact).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (9 learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with bladed physical features or avian "cutting" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Gallade** (who gains a massive boost via Sharpness), **Samurott** (both Unovan and Hisuian forms), and the Paldean starter **Quaquaval**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Seen on **Veluza** and **Cramorant** as a reliable Physical Water STAB option that avoids the contact-punishment mechanics of moves like *Liquidation*.
* **Acquisition:** Currently has limited availability, primarily learned through level-up or as an Egg Move; it is **not** available as a TM/TR in its debut generation.
