## Identity & Mechanics
**Magic Coat** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user shrouds itself in a shimmering, mystical psychic barrier that acts as a temporary mirror. This aura does not mitigate direct damage but instead detects and instantly reflects incoming non-damaging status moves, turning an opponent's interference tactics against them.
* **Effect:** For the duration of the turn, the user reflects the first non-damaging move that targets it. This includes moves that inflict major status effects (Sleep, Burn, Paralyze), stat reductions, or trapping effects (such as Mean Look). It specifically reflects moves like *Leech Seed*, *Attract*, *Stealth Rock*, and *Taunt*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The reflection itself acts as the primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** User (Affects the user to reflect incoming single-target or hazard-setting moves).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Counter-Utility / Anti-Lead / Prediction Tool.
* **Usage:** Magic Coat is a high-skill "reaction" move. With a **+4 Priority** bracket, it almost always executes before the opponent can act, allowing a Pokémon to bounce back hazards (Stealth Rock/Spikes) or crippling status (Will-O-Wisp/Thunder Wave). While the Ability *Magic Bounce* provides this effect passively, Magic Coat allows Pokémon without that ability to punish predictable leads or Stall-oriented walls.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; Priority +4; Cannot be copied by Mirror Move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (189 learners), primarily found among Psychic types, Fairies, and inorganic Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-tier Psychic types like **Mew**, **Alakazam**, and **Deoxys (all forms)** to prevent being shut down by *Taunt*. It is also a staple on **Clefable** and **Gardevoir**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on bulky non-Psychic utility Pokémon like **Toxapex**, **Bastiodon**, and **Porygon2** to surprise opponents attempting to set up hazards or status conditions. 
* **Acquisition:** It was a prominent Move Tutor move in earlier generations (Gen 4-7) and remains accessible to many Pokémon through natural leveling or breeding, though its availability shifted significantly in the most recent generations.
