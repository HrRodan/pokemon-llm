## Identity & Mechanics
**Quiver Dance** is a Status Bug-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user performs a graceful, rhythmic, and mystic dance, often associated with the fluttering of lepidopteran wings. This display of elegance channels inner energy to significantly heighten the user's combat focus and agility. It is widely considered one of the most powerful setup moves in the franchise, transforming frail attackers into unstoppable sweepers.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s **Special Attack**, **Special Defense**, and **Speed** stats by one stage each (+1 to all three).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Stat-modifying status move).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (Status), Accuracy —%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Setup Sweeper / Win-Condition.**
* **Usage:** Quiver Dance is the special-attacking equivalent of *Dragon Dance*, but superior because it provides a simultaneous defensive buff (Sp. Def). It allows a Pokémon to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame while gaining the power to punch through walls and the bulk to survive retaliatory special hits. It is the gold standard for **Bug-type sweepers**.
* **Matchups:** While the move itself deals no damage, it facilitates **Super Effective** STAB coverage for its users against **Psychic, Dark, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Dance-based move**, meaning it can be copied by the ability *Dancer* (Oricorio) and can be blocked by *Soundproof* in certain specific mechanical interactions (though primarily it is defined by its Dance classification).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 learners), primarily restricted to butterfly and moth-based Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Volcarona:** The most iconic user, utilizing the boost to become a premier Fire/Bug-type "nuke" in higher tiers.
    * **Pheromosa:** An Ultra Beast that uses the move to reach terrifying Speed and Special Attack tiers.
    * **Ribombee:** Uses the move in lower tiers to act as a fast, offensive utility pivot.
    * **Butterfree:** Historically relied on this move alongside *Compound Eyes* and *Sleep Powder* to facilitate a "Sleep-and-Sweep" strategy.
* **Coverage Utility:** While mostly limited to Bug-types, it is notably used by **Lilligant** and **Bellossom** (Grass-types) and **Oricorio** (Flying-type) to provide high-tier setup potential outside of the Bug type.
* **Acquisition:** It is almost exclusively learned through **Leveling Up**. It has never been a TM, TR, or Move Tutor move, making its presence on a team highly predictable based on the species.
