## Identity & Mechanics
**Conversion** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** A specialized digital technique where the user reconfigures its own molecular or data-based composition. By scanning its own internal "data" (moveset), the Pokémon alters its elemental typing to match one of its known techniques, allowing for adaptive combat and unpredictable defensive shifts.
* **Effect:** The user’s current type is replaced by the type of one of the other three moves in its moveset, selected at random. Moves like *Hidden Power*, *Weather Ball*, and *Revelation Dance* are treated as Normal-type for this calculation. The move will fail if the only available move types match the user's current type or if the move is *Curse*.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A.
* **Targeting:** Self (User).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy — (N/A), PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** **Utility / Tactical Setup.**
* **Usage:** While the base version of Conversion is often too unpredictable for high-level play due to the random selection, it serves as a precursor to more powerful mechanics. In Generation VII, it gained massive competitive relevance as **Z-Conversion**, which not only changes the user's type to match the move in the first slot (eliminating randomness) but also grants a +1 boost to every stat, turning **Porygon-Z** into a terrifying **Setup Sweeper**. It allows a Pokémon to gain **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** on its primary coverage move (e.g., BoltBeam coverage). 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is used to manipulate weaknesses and resistances.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails if the user's type cannot be changed to a different type.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (3 total learners), functioning as the signature move of the Porygon evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Porygon**, **Porygon2**, and **Porygon-Z**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is limited to the Porygon line, it is rarely seen outside of dedicated "Digital Pokémon" archetypes. Its primary value is transforming **Porygon-Z** into a **Ghost, Electric, or Psychic-type** to gain better offensive STAB and avoid being trapped or hit by Fighting-type moves.
* **Acquisition:** This is a natural-leveling move for the Porygon family and has never been made available via **TM or TR**, maintaining its status as a unique characteristic of man-made, virtual Pokémon.
