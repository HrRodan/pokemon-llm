## Identity & Mechanics
**Power-Up Punch** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user bolsters its muscles and hardens its fists through repeated impact. By striking the opponent, the user channels the momentum of the blow to increase its own physical power. This move is designed for "snowballing" momentum, allowing the user to become progressively more dangerous with every successful hit.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and raises the user’s Attack stat by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise Attack (Guaranteed boost upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Setup Attacker / Snowball Utility.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Power-Up Punch serves as a "damaging setup" tool. It is often preferred over *Bulk Up* or *Swords Dance* on Pokémon that need to break a *Focus Sash* or *Sturdy* while simultaneously gaining offensive pressure. It is famously used to finish off weakened opponents to ensure a "free" boost for the next turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning its damage is amplified by the ability **Iron Fist**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (240 learners), making it one of the most accessible setup options for physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably utilized by **Mega Kangaskhan** (where the *Parental Bond* ability allowed it to hit twice and gain +2 Attack in a single turn), **Lucario**, and **Infernape**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Diggersby** (utilizing *Huge Power* to make the +1 boost lethal) and **Mega Charizard X** to punish predicted switches while boosting its massive Attack stat. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM98** in Generation VI (X/Y and ORAS). In later generations, it transitioned to a more limited movepool but remains a staple for many Fighting-type archetypes.
