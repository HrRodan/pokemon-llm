## Identity & Mechanics
**Bonemerang** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user hurls a sturdy bone at the target like a boomerang. The projectile strikes the opponent once on its way out and a second time as it returns to the user's hand. This two-hit mechanic allows the move to bypass certain defensive barriers and multi-hit protections.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage twice in a single turn. Each hit is calculated independently for Critical Hits and damage rolls.
* **Secondary Effect:** None; however, as a multi-strike move, it excels at breaking **Substitute**, **Focus Sash**, and the **Sturdy** ability.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (Total 100), Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Multi-Strike Wallbreaker / Tech Option.
* **Usage:** Bonemerang is the signature alternative to **Earthquake**. While it shares the same total base power (100), it trades 10% accuracy for the ability to pierce **Focus Sashes** and **Substitutes**, making it a potent anti-meta choice against lead Pokémon or setup sweepers. In older generations, it was a rare way to deal massive damage to **Electric** and **Steel** types while ignoring protective items.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock,** and **Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a projectile-based move (though not officially classified under "Bullet" properties in all games) and is one of the few Ground moves that does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (4 total learners), being the signature move of the Cubone evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Almost exclusively utilized by **Marowak**, **Alolan Marowak**, and **Cubone**. 
* **Competitive Context:** On **Alolan Marowak**, Bonemerang provides vital Ground-type coverage alongside its Ghost/Fire STAB, allowing it to threaten **Heatran** and **Tyranitar**. When paired with the **Thick Club** item, the move's power effectively doubles, making each 50-power hit hit with the force of a nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as coverage on non-Ground types.
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM/TR**; it is learned exclusively through leveling up by its signature users.
