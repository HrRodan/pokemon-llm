## Identity & Mechanics
**Rage** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user enters a state of escalating fury, lashing out at the opponent with building frustration. While the initial impact is weak, the user channels the pain from incoming attacks into raw physical power. This move is designed for "snowballing" momentum by turning an opponent's aggression into a self-buffing mechanism.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the user is hit by an opponent's attack during the same turn after using this move, its Attack stat is raised by one stage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise Attack by +1 stage per hit received.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Gimmick Setup / Early-game Filler.
* **Usage:** In modern competitive play, Rage is considered outclassed by almost all other offensive and setup options due to its abysmal base power. Unlike **Power-Up Punch**, which provides a guaranteed boost upon hit, Rage requires the user to be targeted and damaged to gain momentum. In Generation I, the move functioned differently, locking the user into the move until the end of the battle or fainting, but it remains a niche "flavor" move today. As a Normal-type move, it deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types** and is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, while **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (182 learners), primarily due to its status as a ubiquitous TM in the earliest generations of the series.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with "angry" or "wild" Pokémon such as **Primeape**, **Tauros**, **Gyaryados**, and the **Charizard** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it has massive distribution, it is rarely used for coverage. It is most often seen on early-game Pokémon like **Totodile**, **Mankey**, and **Sandshrew** before they learn more reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM20** in Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow) but has since been relegated to a natural level-up move for Pokémon characterized by a short temper.
