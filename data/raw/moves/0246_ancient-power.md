## Identity & Mechanics
**Ancient Power** is a Special Rock-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user taps into primordial energy, manifesting prehistoric power to attack the target. This often involves the telekinetic summoning of fossilized remains or ancient stones to strike the foe. Its mystical nature allows it to occasionally grant the user a surge of prehistoric strength, enhancing all physical and mental capabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. It has a notable 10% chance to trigger an **Omni-boost**, raising the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats by one stage each simultaneously.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to raise all of the user’s stats by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Setup Utility / Special Coverage.
* **Usage:** Due to its low base power and extremely low PP, it is rarely used for raw damage. Instead, it is utilized as a "fishing" move to secure a game-ending Omni-boost. In competitive formats, it is often compared to **Power Gem** (which offers more consistent damage) or **Meteor Beam** (a high-power Special Rock nuke). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, Special-category attack. It is famously synergistic with the Ability **Serene Grace**, which doubles the Omni-boost chance to 20%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (183 learners), primarily found among Fossil Pokémon, ancient Legendaries, and prehistoric-themed species.
* **Prominent Users:** **Togekiss** (the most iconic user due to *Serene Grace*), **Omastar**, **Aurorus**, and **Dialga/Palkia**.
* **Evolutionary Trigger:** Ancient Power is unique as a "Requirement Move"; **Piloswine**, **Yanma**, and **Tangela** must know this move to evolve into Mamoswine, Yanmega, and Tangrowth, respectively.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Rock types like **Charizard** or **Sigilyph** to provide niche Special Rock coverage against Flying or Ice-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** While not always a TM, it has been widely available via **Move Tutor** or **TR** (Technical Record) in several generations, making it accessible to a vast array of Pokémon.
