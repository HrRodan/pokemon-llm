It is statistically superior to *Steel Wing* and more reliable than the weight-dependent *Heavy Slam* or the accuracy-challenged *Meteor Mash*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**. This move is particularly vital in modern competitive play as a primary tool for "Fairy-slaying," checking top-tier threats like Clefable or Flutter Mane.
