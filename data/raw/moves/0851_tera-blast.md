## Identity & Mechanics
**Tera Blast** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A versatile energy beam fueled by the Terastal phenomenon. When the user Terastallizes, the move transforms into the user's **Tera Type** and glows with the corresponding elemental energy. It functions as a flexible bridge, allowing any Pokémon to wield powerful offensive pressure of any type.
* **Effect:** Normally a Normal-type move. If the user has **Terastallized**, the move's type changes to match the user's Tera Type. Crucially, it automatically calculates damage using the user's **Attack or Sp. Atk stat—whichever is higher**, ensuring viability for both physical and special attackers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Coverage Filler** / **Adaptive STAB**. 
* **Usage:** Tera Blast serves as the spiritual successor to *Hidden Power*, but with significantly higher base power and a requirement to commit the team's Terastallization. It is used to lure and eliminate specific **checks** and **counters**. For example, an Electric-type may use **Tera Ice** Tera Blast to OHKO Ground-type threats that usually wall them. It deals **Super Effective** damage based on the chosen Tera Type (e.g., Tera Flying hits Grass, Bug, and Fighting).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many traditional movepool limitations; it is neither contact-making nor sound-based, making it safe against *Rocky Helmet* or *Soundproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **nearly universal distribution** (858 learners), as it is the defining TM of the Generation IX mechanics.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Regieleki:** Infamously uses **Tera Ice** to bypass its lack of coverage and threaten Ground-types.
    * **Dragonite:** Frequently utilizes **Tera Flying** to gain a reliable, high-power STAB move that it otherwise lacks.
    * **Flutter Mane:** Often runs **Tera Fairy** or **Tera Fire** to boost its cleaning potential or hit Steel-type switch-ins.
* **Coverage Utility:** Essential for Pokémon with "shallow" movepools like **Serperior** (Tera Fire/Ground) or **Jolteon** to provide the necessary coverage to break through defensive cores.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM171** in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, obtainable after defeating the fifth Gym Leader.
