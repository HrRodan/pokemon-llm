## Identity & Mechanics
**Revelation Dance** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rhythmic and vigorous ritualistic dance, channeling its innate elemental essence into a powerful burst of energy. Because the move adapts to the user’s primary typing, the visual appearance shifts—ranging from scorching flames to ghostly auras—making it a versatile tool for elemental specialists.
* **Effect:** This move’s type is dynamic; it automatically matches the **primary type** of the Pokémon using it. If the user has no type (e.g., through Burn Up), the move becomes typeless.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** Revelation Dance serves as a primary offensive tool that is **guaranteed to receive a Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB)**. It functions similarly to Arceus's *Judgment* or Silvally's *Multi-Attack*, providing a high-accuracy, mid-to-high power option without the drawback of recoil or stat drops. It is particularly potent in **Double Battles** due to its interaction with the **Dancer** ability, which allows other Pokémon with that ability to immediately copy the move.
* **Type Matchups:** Depending on the user's form, this move deals **Super Effective** damage to **Steel, Bug, Grass, Ice** (Baile), **Water, Flying** (Pom-Pom), **Fighting, Poison** (Pa'u), or **Ghost, Psychic** (Sensu).
* **Attributes:** This is a **Dance-based move**, meaning it can be copied by the ability *Dancer* and is blocked by the ability *Soundproof* in some specific generational contexts, though primarily it is defined by its elemental shifting.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, as it is the signature move of the Oricorio family (4 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized exclusively by **Oricorio**, adapting to its four distinct styles:
    * **Baile Style:** Becomes a **Fire-type** move.
    * **Pom-Pom Style:** Becomes an **Electric-type** move.
    * **Pa'u Style:** Becomes a **Psychic-type** move.
    * **Sensu Style:** Becomes a **Ghost-type** move.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a coverage move in the traditional sense, it provides Oricorio with a reliable Special STAB option that matches its form-specific secondary typing, which it otherwise might lack through its standard level-up pool.
* **Acquisition:** Level-up only; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor.
