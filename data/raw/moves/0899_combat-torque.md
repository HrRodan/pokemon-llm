## Identity & Mechanics
**Combat Torque** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user revs its engine to maximum output, channeling intense fighting spirit and mechanical torque into a devastating collision. As a signature move of the Caph Starmobile, it represents the fusion of vehicular power and martial prowess, often leaving the opponent stunned by the sheer force of the impact.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent physical damage with no negative drawbacks to the user's stats.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance to Paralyze** the target, making it a dangerous tool for speed control.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **High-Damage STAB / Boss Mechanic.**
* **Usage:** In the context of the Paldea region, this move serves as a "Boss Move" specifically designed for the Team Star encounters. Compared to standard Fighting moves like *Close Combat* (which lowers defenses) or *Drain Punch* (which heals), Combat Torque is strictly superior due to its high base power, perfect accuracy, and significant chance to inflict Paralysis without any trade-offs. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is not a move that can be learned by standard Pokémon through leveling, TM, or breeding.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively used by **Eri’s Caph Starmobile** (a specialized Revavroom variant) during the Team Star boss battle.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is hard-coded to the Starmobile entity, it does not see usage in standard VGC or Smogon formats. If it were widely available, it would be a top-tier choice for physical attackers like **Machamp** or **Conkeldurr** to provide reliable damage and utility.
* **Acquisition:** **Unavailable to players.** It cannot be taught to a standard Revavroom or any other Pokémon via traditional means; it remains a non-transferable boss mechanic within the Generation IX campaign.
