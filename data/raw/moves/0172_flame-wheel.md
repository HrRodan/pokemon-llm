## Identity & Mechanics
**Flame Wheel** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto region).
* **Description:** The user cloaks its entire body in a swirling vortex of intense fire and charges toward the target like a spinning wheel. This friction-based thermal attack generates enough heat to serve as a literal "thaw" for the user, making it a reliable tool in frozen environments.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular physical damage. Notably, this move can be used even while the user is **Frozen**; if used in such a state, the move will immediately thaw the user and proceed with the attack.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Progression Tool.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Flame Wheel is largely outclassed by higher-output moves like **Flare Blitz** (High-Risk Nuke) or **Fire Punch** (Reliable STAB). However, it serves as a vital mid-tier STAB option during the main story of Pokémon games. Its unique ability to bypass the **Freeze** status gives it a niche utility that most physical moves lack. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Flame Wheel has a moderate distribution (32 learners), primarily found among quadrupedal or agile Fire-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is an iconic signature-style move for the **Typhlosion** line (Cyndaquil/Quilava), the **Infernape** line, and **Arcanine** (both Kantonian and Hisuian forms).
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically, it is famously utilized by **Rattata** and **Raticate**, providing them with rare early-game Fire-type physical coverage to handle Steel or Bug types that otherwise resist their Normal-type STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through **Leveling Up**. Unlike many other Fire moves, it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, making its availability strictly tied to the natural movepools of specific species.
