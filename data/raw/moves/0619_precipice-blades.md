## Identity & Mechanics
**Precipice Blades** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VI (Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).
* **Description:** The user taps into the raw tectonic energy of the planet, manifesting the primordial power of the Earth's crust to summon jagged, skyscraper-sized blades of stone and hardened magma from beneath the soil. These massive earthen spikes impale all surrounding foes with catastrophic force, representing the unmatched geological might of the continent-builder.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-output physical damage to the target. It does not have any secondary status-inflicting effects but compensates with raw power.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread damage).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Spread Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Precipice Blades is the signature move of Groudon and serves as its primary STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option in the Ubers and VGC formats. It is a direct upgrade in power over Earthquake, allowing Groudon to secure OHKOs on defensive threats that Earthquake cannot. However, its 85% accuracy introduces a "risk-reward" factor, as a miss can be game-changing. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite its name, it is not a "slicing" move and does not receive a boost from the Sharpness ability; it is a long-range earthen manifestation.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Groudon** and **Primal Groudon**. It is essential for Primal Groudon to maximize its offensive presence under the Desolate Land weather condition.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not used for coverage by other species. On Groudon, it provides essential coverage against Steel-type walls like Zacian-C and Fire-types like Incineroar.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned only by Groudon upon leveling up or through Move Relearning.
