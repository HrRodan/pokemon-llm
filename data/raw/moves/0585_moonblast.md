## Identity & Mechanics
**Moonblast** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** Drawing upon celestial lunar energy, the user focuses a concentrated sphere of shimmering pink moonlight and launches it at the target with explosive force. It is considered the definitive Fairy-type special attack, combining high-output damage with a mystical, debuffing property.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent Special damage. The move's secondary effect is highly valued in competitive play for its ability to soften special attackers.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to lower the target’s **Special Attack** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / **Special Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Moonblast is the "Gold Standard" for Special Fairy-type offense, often compared to moves like Flamethrower or Ice Beam but with a higher base power (95 vs. 90). It is favored over *Dazzling Gleam* in singles for its superior power and high secondary effect chance, which can effectively force an opponent's special attacker to switch out. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Dark, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a projectile-based special attack. It does not make contact, bypassing abilities like *Rough Skin* or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (63 learners), primarily granted to Pokémon with celestial, floral, or mystical themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Extensively used by **Clefable**, **Flutter Mane**, and **Sylveon** as their primary offensive tool. It is the signature-standard for the legendary **Xerneas**, especially when boosted by *Geomancy* and *Fairy Aura*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Fairy types like **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon)** and **Alolan Ninetales** to provide vital coverage against Fighting and Dragon-type threats. 
* **Acquisition:** While not a common TM/TR in its debut generation, it has become a staple in the move pools of most viable Special-attacking Fairy types via leveling or move reminder.
