## Identity & Mechanics
**Eerie Spell** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a haunting, mystical wave of psychic energy that warps the opponent's mind. It manifests as a sinister purple and black aura that drains the target's focus and depletes their ability to sustain combat.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and reduces the PP of the move last used by the target by 3 points.
* **Secondary Effect:** Guaranteed PP reduction upon hit (not a percentage-based chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** **Utility Attacker / Disruptor.**
* **Usage:** While its Base Power is slightly lower than *Psychic* (90), Eerie Spell provides unique **PP stalling** utility. It is particularly effective in long-form matches where depleting an opponent’s low-PP moves—such as *Recover*, *Draco Meteor*, or *Close Combat*—can shift the momentum of a battle. It serves as a reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option that punishes defensive switch-ins.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move. It is not blocked by *Bulletproof* or *Soundproof*.
