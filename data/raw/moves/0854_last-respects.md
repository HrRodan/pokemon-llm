## Identity & Mechanics
**Last Respects** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user manifests a vengeful spectral aura to strike the opponent, channeling the grief and lingering spirits of its fallen comrades. The visual effect typically involves a somber, ghostly energy that intensifies as the user's party dwindles, making it a "clutch" move designed for late-game retribution.
* **Effect:** The move’s base power starts at **50** and increases by **50** for every fainted Pokémon in the user's party during the current battle. In a standard 6v6 Singles match, this move can reach a catastrophic **300 Base Power** if the user is the final Pokémon remaining.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The power scaling is its primary mechanical focus).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (Scalable), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Late-Game Cleaner / Ultimate Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Last Respects is widely considered one of the most powerful moves ever created. It serves as a win condition; players will often preserve the user until the very end of the match to maximize the damage multiplier. Because it is a Ghost-type move, it has excellent neutral coverage, being resisted only by Dark-types and ignored by Normal-types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Strength Sap.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, limited to only 4 specific evolutionary lines (Total 4 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Houndstone:** The most infamous user. When paired with its **Sand Rush** ability in Sandstorm, it becomes a blistering fast, high-powered sweeper that forced the move (or the Pokémon) to be banned from many competitive Smogon tiers.
    * **Basculegion (Male & Female):** Utilizing **Adaptability** (which boosts STAB moves from 1.5x to 2x) or **Swift Swim** in rain, Basculegion becomes a terrifying wallbreaker capable of OHKOing even resistant targets once a few allies have fallen.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no Pokémon outside of the Houndstone and Basculegion lines can learn this move, meaning it is never seen as "coverage"—it is always a primary, build-defining STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option.
* **Acquisition:** It is **not available as a TM or TR**; it is a signature trait of the Greavard and White-Striped Basculin evolutionary lines.
