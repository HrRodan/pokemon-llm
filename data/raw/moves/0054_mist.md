## Identity & Mechanics
**Mist** is a Status Ice-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user exhales or conjures a thick, swirling shroud of white, frigid fog that blankets the user's side of the battlefield. This low-temperature vapor obscures the team's vital points, preventing the opponent from successfully utilizing moves or abilities that would reduce the team's stat stages.
* **Effect:** Protects the user’s side of the field from stat-lowering effects (such as Growl, Leer, or the Intimidate ability) for five turns. While active, the team's stats cannot be lowered by external sources, though self-inflicted drops (e.g., from Draco Meteor) still occur.
* **Secondary Effect:** Moves like Guard Swap, Heart Swap, and Power Swap bypass this protection. Crucially, the move **Defog** used by an opponent will clear the Mist effect entirely.
* **Targeting:** User's Field (Affects all allies in Doubles/Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 30.
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Setup Protection.
* **Usage:** Mist is a niche utility option primarily used to maintain momentum against "Stat-Dropping" strategies. While often outclassed by **Haze** (which resets all stat changes) or **Substitute**, Mist provides proactive protection against the ubiquitous **Intimidate** ability in VGC/Doubles formats. It is effectively a field-wide version of the **Clear Body** ability. It is thematic for Ice and Water types but rarely carries the same weight as offensive STAB moves.
* **Attributes:** Field Effect, Bypasses Accuracy checks, Non-contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (79 learners), primarily concentrated among Water and Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include the legendary bird **Articuno**, the transport Pokémon **Lapras**, and the regal **Empoleon**. It is also frequently found on the **Vaporeon** and **Milotic** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on high-tier threats like **Tapu Fini**, **Dragonite**, and **Chien-Pao**, though these Pokémon typically prefer offensive pressure or more versatile support moves.
* **Acquisition:** Mist is almost exclusively learned through level-up or as an Egg Move. It is notably absent from common TM/TR lists in most generations, making its availability more restricted than other utility moves.
