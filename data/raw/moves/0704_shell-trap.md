## Identity & Mechanics
**Shell Trap** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user turns its explosive, spiny shell toward the opponent to set a volatile trap. If the user is struck by a physical attack, the shell undergoes a massive combustion, releasing a devastating blast of fire across the battlefield. This move emphasizes a reactive, defensive-offensive playstyle centered around high-heat combustion and counter-pressure.
* **Effect:** This is a reactive move with a **-3 Priority** bracket. The move will only successfully execute and deal damage if the user is hit by a **Physical move** from an opponent during the same turn before the user acts. If the user is not hit, is hit only by Special moves, or is flinched, the move fails.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread damage in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reactive Nuke / Anti-Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Shell Trap functions as a high-risk deterrent against physical attackers. While its base power is equal to massive moves like *Eruption* or *Fire Blast* (under certain conditions), its reliance on being hit makes it predictable. It is most effective when the user anticipates a contact-heavy physical attacker. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Negative Priority (-3). Unlike *Counter*, it calculates damage based on its own massive 150 Base Power rather than the damage taken. As a spread move in Doubles, it can punish both opponents if one of them triggers the trap.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Turtonator**. The move is designed to synergize with Turtonator's high physical Defense, allowing it to tank a physical hit and retaliate with a 150-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) blast.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not seen on other Pokémon. In competitive tiers where Turtonator is legal, it serves as its primary niche to punish Pokémon like Scizor or Kartana.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it can only be learned by Turtonator via leveling up.
