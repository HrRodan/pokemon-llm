## Identity & Mechanics
**Wicked Torque** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user revs its engine to a high-pitched scream, channeling malevolent energy before slamming into the target. This move is characterized by the dark, oily exhaust and intimidating presence of the Segin Starmobile, designed to overwhelm the opponent's senses with a combination of physical force and psychological pressure.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10% chance** to induce the **Sleep** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **80**, Accuracy **100%**, PP **10** (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Utility.
* **Usage:** In the context of the Paldea region's boss battles, it serves as a reliable Dark-type STAB move. While its power is identical to *Crunch* or *Throat Chop*, the potential to induce **Sleep**—one of the most powerful status conditions in the game—makes it significantly more threatening. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is an NPC-exclusive signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the **Segin Starmobile (Revavroom)**, piloted by Team Star's Dark-crew leader, Giacomo.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is an NPC-exclusive move tied to the "Starmobile" forms of Revavroom, it is not found on standard competitive Pokémon. In a hypothetical scenario where it was available, it would be a top-tier choice for physical Dark-type attackers due to the rare Sleep-inducing secondary effect.
* **Acquisition:** **Not available via TM/TR.** It is a specialized move that players cannot naturally teach to their own Pokémon through standard gameplay, making it a unique "Boss" mechanic.
