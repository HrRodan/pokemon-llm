## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Chill** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically appearing in the GameCube title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user exhales a haunting, violet-tinted blast of Absolute Zero energy corrupted by Shadow aura. This frigid wave manifests as a dark mist that saps the life force and warmth from the target, combining the biting cold of an arctic gale with the oppressive nature of a closed heart. 
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. In its home game, Shadow moves are uniquely super effective against all non-Shadow Pokémon and not very effective against other Shadow Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Freeze** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (N/A).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Utility Attacker.
* **Usage:** Shadow Chill serves as the Shadow-type equivalent to mid-tier Ice-type moves like *Icy Wind* or a slightly weaker *Ice Beam*. Because it deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow types** (including Fire, Steel, and Water which usually resist Ice), it is an incredibly potent offensive tool for breaking through defensive walls. The 10% Freeze chance adds a "hail mary" utility that can instantly shut down an opponent's Pokémon.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by King's Rock logic variations in spin-offs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, restricted exclusively to "Shadow Pokémon" captured in the Orre Region.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Shadow Articuno**, where it serves as its signature corrupted elemental attack. It is also found on **Shadow Lapras**, **Shadow Cloyster**, and **Shadow Glalie**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Shadow Vaporeon** or **Shadow Swampert** in *Pokémon XD*, providing these Water-types with a way to bypass their usual counters (like Grass or Dragon types) with guaranteed super-effective Shadow damage.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is only available to specific Pokémon while they are in their "Shadow" state; once purified, the move is replaced.
