## Identity & Mechanics
**Growth** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user forces its body to grow and expand at an accelerated biological rate, surging with internal energy. This rapid development enhances the user's physical power and mental focus, making it a versatile tool for Pokémon capable of harnessing natural energy.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s **Attack** and **Special Attack** stats by one stage each. However, if the weather is **Harsh Sunlight**, both stats are increased by **two stages** instead.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Mixed Setup Sweeper / Weather-Dependent Nuke.
* **Usage:** In neutral weather, Growth is generally considered inferior to dedicated boosting moves like *Swords Dance* or *Nasty Plot*, as it only provides a +1 increase. Its true potential is unlocked in **Sun Teams**. Under the sun, it functions as a dual-stat *Swords Dance*, making it the gold standard for **Chlorophyll** sweepers who can outspeed the meta and threaten both physical and special walls simultaneously.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage directly, but it enables the user to overcome resistances by boosting offensive pressure.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; affected by Snatch; scales significantly with Weather (Sun).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (87 learners), predominantly found among Grass-type Pokémon and those with plant-like physiology.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Venusaur** (specifically Mega-Venusaur or Gigantamax Venusaur in Sun), **Serperior**, and **Victreebel**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on the Fire/Grass type **Scovillain** to bolster its mixed attacking stats, and on Paradox Pokémon like **Brute Bonnet** to capitalize on its *Protosynthesis* ability in sunny weather.
* **Acquisition:** While it was a TM in very early generations, it is now primarily learned through **level-up** by the vast majority of Grass-type families. Some Pokémon, like **Numel**, provide rare non-Grass-type access to the move.
