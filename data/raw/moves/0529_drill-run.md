## Identity & Mechanics
**Drill Run** is a physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user transforms its entire body, a horn, or a specialized appendage into a high-speed rotating drill, crashing headlong into the target with piercing force. This spiraling momentum is designed to puncture defenses and strike vital points, significantly increasing the likelihood of a critical hit.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular physical damage with an increased critical hit ratio (Stage +1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (High Critical Hit Ratio inherent to the move).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (adjacent).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Precision Coverage.
* **Usage:** While often overshadowed by the raw power of *Earthquake* (100 Power/100 Accuracy), Drill Run serves as a vital alternative for Pokémon that lack access to Earthquake or need a Ground-type move that does not hit allies in Doubles formats. Its high critical hit ratio makes it a synergy pick for users with the **Scope Lens** item or the **Super Luck** ability, effectively bypassing defensive stat boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (54 learners), often granted to Pokémon with drills, horns, or pointed snouts.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a signature-flavor move for **Excadrill**, and a core STAB option for **Samurott-Hisui** and **Sandaconda**. It was also a defining coverage move for **Mega Beedrill** in previous generations.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Rapidash (Galar)**, **Escavalier**, and **Barraskewda** to provide essential coverage against Steel and Electric types that would otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple customization tool for physical attackers.
