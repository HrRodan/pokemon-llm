## Identity & Mechanics
**Low Sweep** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user performs a swift, tactical strike aimed at the target's lower limbs or base. By tripping or bruising the opponent's legs, the user forcefully disrupts their mobility and footwork. This martial arts maneuver is designed to hamper the target’s agility, making them more vulnerable to subsequent attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and guaranteed to lower the target's Speed stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Speed.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Speed Control Utility / Momentum Generator.
* **Usage:** While its base power is modest, Low Sweep is valued for its **guaranteed Speed reduction**, making it an excellent tool for punishing fast offensive switch-ins or "checks." It is frequently compared to *Brick Break* (which offers screen-breaking utility) and *Close Combat* (which offers raw nuke potential). In lower tiers or specific sets, it serves as a reliable STAB move that facilitates "Speed Creeping" without requiring a Choice Scarf. It is notably powerful when used by Pokémon with the **Technician** ability, which boosts its power to a significant 97.5.
* **Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (170 learners), making it one of the most accessible Fighting-type coverage options in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Breloom** (a premier Technician user), **Machamp**, **Lucario**, and the Paradox Pokémon **Iron Hands**. It is also a staple for the Legendary **Koraidon** and the versatile **Annihilape**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Mewtwo**, **Greninja**, and **Weavile** to provide reliable Fighting-type coverage while simultaneously providing speed control against faster threats like Dragapult or Choice Scarf users. It is also a niche option on **Maushold** to punish Steel-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (Technical Machine) across all generations since its debut, ensuring it is a staple in competitive team building.
