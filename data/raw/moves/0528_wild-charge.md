## Identity & Mechanics
**Wild Charge** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user shrouds its entire body in a crackling aura of high-voltage electricity and executes a violent, full-body tackle into the target. This high-velocity collision generates significant kinetic force, but the resulting electrical discharge and impact cause the user to sustain internal damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The user receives recoil damage equal to 1/4 (25%) of the total damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Recoil-Based Physical Attacker.
* **Usage:** Wild Charge serves as the standard physical counterpart to Thunderbolt. While its 90 base power is respectable, the recoil cost makes it riskier for sustained sweeps. It is often preferred over **Thunder Punch** (75 Power) for its higher damage ceiling, which is often necessary for physical Electric-type attackers to secure KOs against bulky Water-types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and the Static ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (186 learners), making it the "gold standard" for physical Electric coverage.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely utilized by physical Electric threats such as **Luxray**, **Electivire**, **Zeraora**, and **Tapu Koko**. It is also a primary physical STAB option for the legendary **Zekrom** and **Pawmot**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon like **Arcanine**, **Zacian-Crowned**, and **Tauros** (including Paldean forms) to provide vital coverage against bulky Flying-types like Corviknight or Water-types like Toxapex.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has been available as **TM93** or **TR86** in every generation since its debut, ensuring most physical attackers have access to it.
