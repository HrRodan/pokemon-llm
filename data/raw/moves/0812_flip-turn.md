## Identity & Mechanics
**Flip Turn** is a physical Water-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** The user performs a high-speed aquatic maneuver, striking the opponent with its body before using the momentum of the impact to dive back into its Poké Ball. This swift retreat allows a trainer to send out a replacement Pokémon immediately, maintaining offensive pressure or escaping unfavorable matchups.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and then causes the user to switch out of battle. The user is replaced by another Pokémon in the party, provided the user has not fainted and there is at least one conscious Pokémon remaining in the party.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Offensive Pivot** / **Momentum Generator**.
* **Usage:** Flip Turn functions as the Water-type equivalent of *U-turn* and *Volt Switch*. It is a cornerstone of competitive play, allowing a Pokémon to chip away at an opponent's health while safely repositioning a teammate onto the field. While its power is modest, the utility of "momentum" is invaluable. It is particularly dangerous because, unlike Volt Switch, it cannot be naturally blocked by an immune type (though it is countered by abilities like **Water Absorb**, **Dry Skin**, or **Storm Drain**). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (75 learners), primarily limited to aquatic species and exceptionally agile Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Palafin:** Flip Turn is essential to Palafin's kit, as it allows it to deal damage while switching out to trigger its **Zero-to-Hero** transformation.
    * **Swampert:** Utilizes the move as a slow pivot, taking a hit and then switching in a glass cannon teammate safely.
    * **Barraskewda:** A premier offensive pivot that uses its immense speed and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) to chip enemies and cycle out.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-traditional Water threats like **Iron Bundle** or **Walking Wake**; even though these Pokémon are primarily Special Attackers, the utility of a guaranteed switch-out often outweighs the lower damage output.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available as a **TM** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple for most physical Water-types in the current meta.
