## Identity & Mechanics
**Flame Charge** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user cloaks its entire body in a swirling aura of intense flames and slams into the target. This combustion generates kinetic energy, allowing the user to build momentum and increase its agility. This move is highly valued for its ability to combine chip damage with significant stat progression, making it a "setup attack" designed to facilitate a sweep.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and carries a guaranteed (100%) chance to raise the user’s Speed stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise Speed.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Setup.
* **Usage:** While its base power is too low to be a primary offensive "Nuke," Flame Charge is a premier **Speed-Control** tool. It is often used by Physical sweepers to outpace common **Revenge Killers** or **Choice Scarf** users. In competitive tiers, it serves as a niche alternative to Dragon Dance or Agility, providing chip damage that can break **Focus Sashes** or **Sturdy** while simultaneously boosting stats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or Iron Barbs and is affected by Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (116 learners), appearing on almost every fully evolved Fire-type and several non-Fire Pokémon that possess high internal heat or electrical momentum.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard** (specifically Mega Charizard X), **Blaziken**, and **Cinderace** to ensure they maintain first-move priority against faster threats. It is also a core part of **Ceruledge's** and **Skeledirge's** potential kits in Generation IX.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon like **Zebstrika** and **Solgaleo** to provide rare Fire-type coverage while boosting their Speed tier to bypass potential checks. **Celesteela** has also been known to carry it in specific formats to turn into a snowballing offensive threat.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM43** (Gen 5-7) and **TM038** (Gen 9), making it highly accessible to physical attackers across most regional Pokédexes.
