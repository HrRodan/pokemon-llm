## Identity & Mechanics
**Punishment** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a strike of shadowy retribution that grows in intensity based on the opponent's hubris. This move is designed to punish setup sweepers by drawing power from their boosted attributes, manifesting as a dark energy attack that overwhelms those who have spent turns increasing their stats.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The move's base power starts at **60** and increases by **20** for every positive stat stage the target has accrued (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed). The power caps at a maximum of **200**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. Note that accuracy and evasion modifiers do not contribute to the power calculation.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable 60–200], Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Counter-Setup Nuke / Anti-Sweeper Tech.
* **Usage:** Punishment serves as a niche alternative to more reliable Dark-type STAB moves like **Crunch** or **Knock Off**. While its base power is low, it becomes a high-damage **Nuke** against targets using moves like Swords Dance, Dragon Dance, or Calm Mind. If a foe has just two stat boosts (e.g., one Swords Dance), Punishment reaches 100 Base Power, outclassing most standard options. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (32 total learners), primarily concentrated among Dark-types and aggressive Physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** It is most notably utilized by **Lugia** and **Ho-Oh** as a way to punish opposing setup, as well as **Weavile** and **Honchkrow**, who can utilize it as a high-ceiling STAB option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Infernape** and **Landorus-Therian**. For these Pokémon, Punishment acts as a specific **Check** against bulky Psychic-type walls that attempt to boost their Special Defense (e.g., Calm Mind users) or Physical sweepers.
* **Acquisition:** Punishment is primarily learned through level-up; it has rarely been available as a TM/TR, limiting its use to its natural learners. It is notably absent from the movepools of Pokémon in the most recent generations (Gen VIII and IX).
