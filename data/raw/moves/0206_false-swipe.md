## Identity & Mechanics
**False Swipe** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto region).
* **Description:** A restrained attack that prevents the target from fainting, even if it would normally be knocked out. The user strikes with precise control—often using the flat of a blade or a blunt claw—ensuring the opponent is left with exactly 1 HP. This move is the definitive tool for Trainers seeking to weaken wild Pokémon for capture without the risk of an accidental knockout.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage, but will never reduce the target's HP below 1. If the move would deal damage equal to or greater than the target's remaining HP, the target is left with 1 HP instead.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Utility / Capture Specialist.
* **Usage:** False Swipe is virtually non-existent in standard competitive PvP (Smogon/VGC) because its primary mechanic—the inability to faint an opponent—prevents the user from ever taking a prize card or "checking" a threat. However, it is an **S-Tier utility move** for "Shiny Hunting" and completing the Pokédex. It is often paired with status moves like **Spore** or **Thunder Wave** to maximize capture rates. It deals **Super Effective** damage to no types (as it is Normal-type) and is completely **negated by Ghost-types**, requiring the use of the move "Soak" or the Ability "Scrappy" to hit them.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**. This means it can trigger abilities like Rough Skin or held items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (153 learners), particularly among Pokémon with claws, blades, or scythes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Gallade**, **Scizor**, and **Breloom**. These three are considered the premier "Catching Specialists" because they can combine False Swipe with sleep-inducing moves or high defensive stats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on powerful physical attackers like **Garchomp**, **Haxorus**, and **Kingambit** during the main-game campaign to facilitate catching Legendary Pokémon or rare encounters.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in almost every generation since its debut, making it accessible to a massive variety of Pokémon via teaching.
