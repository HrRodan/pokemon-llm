## Identity & Mechanics
**Incinerate** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user attacks the target with a concentrated burst of intense flame. The heat is so extreme that it instantly vaporizes organic material held by the opponent. This move is specifically designed to neutralize tactical items, turning a standard elemental strike into a disruptive utility tool.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and destroys the target's held **Berry**. Once incinerated, the Berry cannot be used or recovered through most means.
* **Secondary Effect:** If the move triggers a Berry's consumption threshold (e.g., a Sitrus Berry at 50% HP), the Berry is destroyed **before** the target can consume it. In later generations, it was updated to also destroy **Gems**.
* **Targeting:** Hits **all adjacent opponents** in double and triple battles, making it an effective spread move for multi-target item disruption.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility Tech / Anti-Meta Disruption.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low compared to staples like **Flamethrower** or **Fire Blast**, Incinerate is used to punish "Pinch Berry" strategies (like Iapapa or Salac Berries) and defensive "Sitrus Berry" sets. In early-game playthroughs, it serves as a reliable TM progression move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move does not make contact. It is blocked by the ability **Bulletproof** in certain iterations and is affected by **Flash Fire**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (218 total learners), being a common TM (TM59) in Generations V and VI.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fire-types such as **Charizard**, **Blaziken**, **Chandelure**, and the Legendary **Groudon** (Primal Groudon utilizes its massive Special Attack to make even low-power Fire moves threatening).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon like **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, and **Nidoking** to provide a spread-damage option that doubles as item removal against defensive walls.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM** in the Unova, Kalos, and Hoenn (ORAS) regions, making it accessible to a vast array of Pokémon that can breathe fire or generate intense heat.
