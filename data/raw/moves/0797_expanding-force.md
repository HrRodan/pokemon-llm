## Identity & Mechanics
**Expanding Force** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield: Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental energy to unleash a powerful telekinetic wave. While it functions as a standard psychic attack under normal conditions, it resonates with the environment when **Psychic Terrain** is active. In this state, the move's power is amplified by 1.5x (reaching 120 Base Power) and its range expands to strike all adjacent opponents simultaneously.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the user is grounded and Psychic Terrain is active, the move's power increases by 50% and it targets all opposing Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power and target modification only).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Normal); All Opponents (In Psychic Terrain).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Terrain-Dependent Nuke / Spread Sweeper.
* **Usage:** Expanding Force is the definitive reason to run "Psychic Spam" archetypes in VGC and Doubles formats. While it is slightly weaker than *Psychic* (90 BP) outside of terrain, it becomes one of the most oppressive moves in the game inside terrain, effectively functioning as a 120 BP spread move that avoids the standard spread damage reduction when calculating the terrain boost. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many defensive checks by hitting both opponents; heavily reliant on **Psychic Surge** support.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (104 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic-type Pokémon and those with high intellectual or mystical themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Indeedee (Female & Male)** (who sets the terrain automatically), **Armarouge** (a premier VGC attacker), and **Hatterene** (especially in Trick Room compositions).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on powerful Special Attackers like **Mewtwo**, **Alakazam**, and **Calyrex-Shadow** to capitalize on the massive damage multiplier provided by the terrain.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in the Isle of Armor (Gen VIII), it is now widely available via **TM161** in Scarlet and Violet.
