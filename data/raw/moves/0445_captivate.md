## Identity & Mechanics
**Captivate** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user exerts an irresistible, alluring charm on the target, overwhelming their focus with a flirtatious display. This mental distraction causes the target to lose their competitive edge, resulting in a significant decrease in their offensive magical or elemental energy. 
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Special Attack stat by two stages (-2). **Crucially**, the move will only succeed if the user and the target are of the opposite gender. It fails if both share a gender, if either is genderless (such as most Legendaries or robotic Pokémon), or if the target is behind a Substitute.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply debuff if gender conditions are met).
* **Targeting:** All opponents (In Double Battles, it attempts to affect both adjacent foes).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Niche Utility / Special Debuff.
* **Usage:** Captivate is a "High-Risk, High-Reward" debuff. While a two-stage drop (-2) is powerful enough to neutralize most **Special Sweepers**, its dependency on the gender mechanic makes it highly unreliable in a competitive meta where genderless Pokémon (like Iron Valiant or Gholdengo) are common. It is generally outclassed by **Eerie Impulse** (which lacks the gender restriction) or **Confide** (which bypasses substitutes, though it only drops the stat by one stage).
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type status move, it can affect all types, including Ghost-types, unless they have specific ability-based immunities.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypassed by Pokémon with the **Oblivious** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (458 learners), largely due to its status as a TM in Generation IV.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Pokémon such as **Venusaur**, **Gardevoir**, **Milotic**, and **Lopunny** are frequently associated with this move's "alluring" theme. 
* **Coverage Utility:** It is surprisingly common on aggressive physical threats like **Garchomp**, **Lucario**, and **Tyranitar**, who could theoretically use it to weaken special-attacking checks, though this is rarely seen in high-level play.
* **Acquisition:** Captivate was widely taught via **TM78** during the Sinnoh and Johto (HGSS) eras. In later generations, it became a much rarer move, often relegated to breeding or specific Move Tutors.
