## Identity & Mechanics
**Magma Storm** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user manifests a violent vortex of molten slag and incinerating heat, centering a maelstrom of fire around the target. This move creates a persistent volcanic eruption on the battlefield, preventing the opponent's escape while dealing continuous searing damage over several turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts immediate damage and traps the target for 2–5 turns. While trapped, the target cannot switch out or flee and takes residual damage equal to 1/8th (1/16th in Gen 4-5) of its maximum HP at the end of each turn. The effect ends if the user leaves the field or if the target uses Rapid Spin or Mortal Spin.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to inflict the **Trapping/Binding** status condition upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 75%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Trapping Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Magma Storm is a high-utility "Binding Move" that serves as the cornerstone of stall-breaking strategies. Unlike *Fire Blast*, which offers similar power and accuracy, Magma Storm's value lies in its ability to prevent the opponent from switching to a defensive counter. This allows the user to "trap" a passive wall (like Blissey or Toxapex) and eliminate them with a combination of residual damage, Taunt, and secondary coverage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Grass, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, special-based projectile move. It is notably blocked by the ability *Bulletproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Heatran**. It is the defining move of Heatran's competitive identity, allowing it to function as one of the premier "Trapper" threats in the Overused (OU) tier. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, on Heatran, it is used to specifically trap and remove **Steel-type** mirrors or **Fairy-type** Pokémon that cannot touch Heatran’s unique Fire/Steel typing.
* **Acquisition:** Only available to Heatran via level-up. It is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other species.
