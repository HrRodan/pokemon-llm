## Identity & Mechanics
**Snatch** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user prepares to intercept the opponent's next action with predatory intent. It creates a tactical window where the user waits to "heist" any beneficial energy or healing the target attempts to manifest, instantly claiming those effects for itself. This move is a high-priority psychological tool that turns an opponent's momentum into the user's advantage.
* **Effect:** The user gains a +4 Priority bracket for the turn. If any other Pokémon on the field attempts to use a "Snatchable" move (typically self-targeting beneficial moves like stat boosts, healing, or substitutions), the user of Snatch intercepts the move, causing the original user to fail while the Snatcher receives the full effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user (Field effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Setup Tech.
* **Usage:** Snatch serves as a high-skill "anti-meta" option. While **Taunt** prevents setup moves from occurring, Snatch is more punishing because it allows the user to steal the boost (e.g., stealing a **Dragon Dance**, **Calm Mind**, or **Roost**). It is particularly effective in Doubles to punish **Tailwind** or **Wide Guard**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to no types directly, as it is a status move, but its Dark typing makes it flavorfully thematic for "thievery" mechanics.
* **Attributes:** +4 Priority (Faster than most moves, including Protect and Extreme Speed).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (179 learners), though its availability in recent generations has been significantly curtailed.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Mewtwo**, **Darkrai**, and **Serperior**, who use their high speed to predict and steal recovery or setup moves.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on fast utility Pokémon like **Liepard** (who can also leverage Prankster, though Snatch's native +4 priority usually suffices) and **Talonflame** to punish opponents expecting to heal or set up screens.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available as **TM49** in Generations 3 and 4, and via Move Tutors in subsequent eras, making it a common tech choice for a wide variety of Psychic, Dark, and Ghost types.
