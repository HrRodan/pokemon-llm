## Identity & Mechanics
**Guard Split** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user focuses its psychic energy to create a mathematical resonance between itself and the target. This mental link forces a recalibration of physical and special durability, effectively equalizing the molecular density and defensive posture of both Pokémon. It is a tactical move used to bridge the gap between fragile glass cannons and sturdy walls.
* **Effect:** The move averages the user’s current unmodified Defense stat with the target’s unmodified Defense stat; both Pokémon then adopt this new value as their current Defense. The user’s unmodified Special Defense is then averaged with the target’s unmodified Special Defense in the exact same manner.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Stat redistribution).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Non-adjacent in Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Disruptor / Tactical Utility.
* **Usage:** Guard Split is a niche "Tank-Buster" or "Self-Buff" tool. It is most famously used by Pokémon with extreme defensive stat spreads. For a Pokémon with massive defenses (like Shuckle), it serves as a way to "cripple" an opponent's bulk by forcing them to take on a lower average, while a fragile Pokémon can use it to "steal" bulk from a defensive wall. It bypasses accuracy checks, making it a guaranteed redistribution unless the opponent uses Protect or has Magic Coat.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and therefore ignores type-based resistances, though Dark-types are immune to it if the user has the Prankster ability (due to Gen VII mechanics).
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not blocked by Bulletproof or Soundproof abilities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, learned by only 28 Pokémon across all generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically utilized by **Shuckle**, who uses its base 230 Defenses to significantly lower an opponent's bulk while maintaining a high average for itself. It is also learned by Legendaries like **Latias** and **Diancie**, and the Ultra Beast **Nihilego**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon with lopsided stats like **Rhyperior** or **Bastiodon** to manipulate the field in Doubles, specifically to buff a frail ally's survivability.
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is almost exclusively learned via level-up or Egg Move. It is notably absent from TM/TR/Technical Machine lists in most generations.
