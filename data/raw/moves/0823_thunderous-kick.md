## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunderous Kick** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user overwhelms the target with blinding, lightning-like speed, moving faster than the eye can follow before delivering a devastating physical blow. Despite the name and visual cues suggesting electricity, it is a pure feat of martial prowess that shatters the opponent's guard. This move is designed for high-impact physical pressure, emphasizing speed and kinetic force to crumble enemy resistances.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and lowers the target's Defense stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target's Defense.
* **Targeting:** Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker** / **Consistency STAB**.
* **Usage:** Thunderous Kick serves as a highly reliable signature STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. While it has lower raw power than *Close Combat* (120 Power), it is often preferred in prolonged engagements because it lacks the self-lowering defensive drawbacks. Instead, it applies offensive pressure by guaranteeing a **Defense drop**, making subsequent hits—or hits from teammates—significantly more lethal. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Iron Barbs*, or *Rough Skin*. It is also categorized as a **Kicking move**, though currently, few abilities specifically buff this category.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of a specific Legendary variant.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Galarian Zapdos**. The move perfectly synergizes with Galarian Zapdos's *Defiant* ability, as it forces the opponent to consider the risk of using Intimidate or other stat-lowering moves while Zapdos simultaneously shreds the opponent's physical bulk.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can learn this move via TM, TR, or Breeding, making it a unique identifier for Galarian Zapdos in the competitive meta.
* **Acquisition:** Learned by Galarian Zapdos upon evolution or leveling up; it is not available via technical machines.
