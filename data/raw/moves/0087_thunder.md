## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunder** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user summons a gargantuan bolt of lightning from the sky to strike the target with cataclysmic force. This high-voltage discharge ionizes the surrounding air, creating a massive crack of sound and a blinding flash that can leave the target physically incapacitated. In heavy rainfall, the bolt is guided perfectly by the moisture, ensuring a guaranteed strike.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant damage. Its accuracy is highly dependent on weather conditions: it becomes **100% accurate in Rain** but drops to **50% accuracy in Harsh Sunlight**. Unique to certain generations, it possesses a niche ability to bypass the protection of moves like *Protect* or *Detect* (with a 30% success rate based on its missing accuracy). It can also strike semi-invulnerable targets using *Fly*, *Bounce*, or *Sky Drop*.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to inflict the **Paralysis** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Single-target (Adjacent).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 70%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Weather-Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Thunder is the high-power alternative to *Thunderbolt*. While its base 70% accuracy is often too risky for standard play, it is a mandatory staple on **Rain Teams** (utilizing Drizzle or Rain Dance) where it becomes a perfectly accurate, high-damage nuke. The 30% paralysis chance is significantly higher than Thunderbolt’s 10%, making it a potent tool for fishing for "full paralysis" turns. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks in Rain; can hit targets in the semi-invulnerable state of the Fly/Bounce.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (305 learners), making it one of the most accessible high-power TMs in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Kyogre** (Primal or Standard), which sets its own Rain to ensure 100% accuracy. It is also a premier choice for **Zapdos**, **Raging Bolt**, and **Raikou** when paired with weather support.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon with high Special Attack, such as **Dragonite**, **Goodra**, and **Palkia**, specifically to punish bulky Water-types or to take advantage of the Rain they often occupy. **Gengar** and **Starmie** historically used it to round out "Bolt-Beam" (Electric/Ice) coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM25** (or TR09 in Gen 8) across almost every generation, typically purchasable at major Department Stores or found in late-game power plants.
