## Identity & Mechanics
**Spirit Shackle** is a Physical Ghost-type signature move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user fires a spectral arrow infused with ghostly energy that pierces the opponent and stitches their shadow directly to the ground. This haunting maneuver physically anchors the target to the battlefield, preventing them from retreating through mystical binding.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and prevents the target from switching out or fleeing as long as the user remains active on the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the **Trapping** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility Offensive Trapper / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Spirit Shackle is a specialized tool used to "trap and remove" specific threats. Unlike most Ghost-type physical moves like *Shadow Claw* (70 BP), it offers higher consistent damage while providing the immense tactical advantage of preventing a manual switch. It allows the user to isolate defensive walls or weakened targets to set up or secure a KO. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move (blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 primary learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Decidueye** (and its Hisuian variant). It serves as the cornerstone of Decidueye's Alolan identity, often paired with the Grassium Z or specialized Z-Crystal (Decidium Z) to become *Sinister Arrow Raid*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon; it is strictly a STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option for its specific evolutionary line.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned upon evolution or through leveling up.
