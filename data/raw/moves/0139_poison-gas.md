## Identity & Mechanics
**Poison Gas** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user expels a cloud of noxious, purple fumes or industrial vapors that blankets the opposing side of the battlefield. This hazardous haze is designed to be inhaled by foes, causing immediate respiratory distress and lingering biological damage. For RAG purposes, this move is associated with toxic clouds, airborne pollutants, and chemical warfare.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Poison** status condition on the target(s). Unlike *Toxic*, this move inflicts regular Poisoning (reducing HP by 1/8th every turn) rather than Badly Poisoned status.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the status infliction).
* **Targeting:** **All Opponents**. This makes it a "spread move" in Double and Triple battles, capable of poisoning multiple foes simultaneously.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 90%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Status Spreader / Chip-Damage Utility.
* **Usage:** While often overshadowed by *Toxic* in Single Battles due to the latter's escalating damage, Poison Gas finds a niche in **Double Battles (VGC)** because it targets both opponents at once. Its 90% accuracy (buffed from 55% in earlier generations) makes it a relatively reliable way to break **Focus Sashes** and put a timer on bulky threats. It is notably ineffective against **Poison** and **Steel** types unless the user possesses the **Corrosion** ability.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is blocked by the ability **Bulletproof** in some generations (though primarily categorized as a gas-based move) and is completely negated by **Magic Bounce** or **Substitutes**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (29 learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with "industrial" or "venomous" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by the **Koffing/Weezing** line, **Grimer/Muk**, **Garbodor**, and the Mythical Pokémon **Pecharunt**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Hypno** and **Magmortar** as a disruption tool. The most dangerous user is **Salazzle**, whose **Corrosion** ability allows Poison Gas to poison Steel and Poison-type Pokémon that would otherwise be immune to the haze.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via level-up. It is **not available as a TM or TR**, making its distribution strictly tied to the biological flavor of the Pokémon.
