## Identity & Mechanics
**Destiny Bond** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user weaves a sinister, spectral connection between its own life force and that of its opponent. By establishing this dark resonance, the user ensures that if it falls in battle, its assailant is dragged down into the faint state alongside it. This move is a high-stakes tactical maneuver used to force a "one-for-one" trade, effectively neutralizing a dangerous opponent at the cost of the user's own remaining HP.
* **Effect:** If the user faints as a direct result of an attack from an opponent before the user's next turn, the attacking Pokémon also faints. It does not trigger if the user faints from indirect damage such as Burn, Poison, Sandstorm, or Entry Hazards. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, as of Generation VII, the move will fail if used successfully on the previous turn, preventing "Destiny Bond spamming."
* **Targeting:** User (affects the opponent who faints the user).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Vengeance Utility / Forced Trade.
* **Usage:** Destiny Bond is a premier "Kamikaze" move used by fast, frail attackers to ensure they take an enemy down with them when they can no longer sweep. It is a psychological tool that forces the opponent to play around "the bond," often leading to "Sucker Punch" mind games or forcing a switch. It is particularly lethal when paired with **Shadow Tag** or **Mean Look**, as it prevents the opponent from escaping the forced trade.
* **Attributes:** This move bypasses accuracy checks and ignores type immunities (Normal-types can still be fainted by this Ghost-type status effect). It cannot be called by **Assist** or **Metronome**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), primarily concentrated among Ghost, Poison, and Psychic types.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Gengar** (who uses its high Speed to ensure the bond is set) and **Wobbuffet** (who uses Shadow Tag to trap victims). **Froslass** is another iconic user, often utilizing it as a "Suicide Lead" after setting Spikes.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on modern Paradox Pokémon like **Iron Valiant** or fast Fairy-types like **Mimikyu** to shut down an opposing setup sweeper that has gained too many boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up or as an Egg Move. Unlike many utility moves, it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its presence on a team a specific and deliberate teambuilding choice.
