## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Rush** is a Physical Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically within the Orre region titles (*Pokémon Colosseum* and *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*).

* **Description:** The user shrouds itself in a dark, malicious aura and tackles the target with reckless abandon. As the quintessential Shadow move, it represents the raw, unrefined power of a Pokémon whose heart has been artificially closed. In combat, it manifests as a shadowy charge that bypasses standard elemental resistances.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. While the user is in **Hyper Mode** (Colosseum) or **Reverse Mode** (XD), the move gains a boosted critical hit ratio.
* **Secondary Effect:** In *Pokémon XD*, this move causes 1/16th recoil damage to the user. In *Colosseum*, it has no recoil but risks the Pokémon entering a disobedient state.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 55, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (Unlimited/Game-specific).
* **Role:** Early-game Shadow STAB / Reliable Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** Within the context of the Orre games, Shadow Rush serves as the primary offensive tool for newly snagged Shadow Pokémon. In *Pokémon XD*, it is uniquely powerful because **Shadow moves are Super Effective against all non-Shadow Pokémon**, making it a universal coverage tool. In *Colosseum*, it deals **Neutral damage** to all types, making it a reliable way to whittle down foes without worrying about type disadvantage.
* **Attributes:** Contact move; bypasses standard type-effectiveness charts (deals "Shadow" damage).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a unique distribution, as it is not learned via leveling up in mainline games but is the **default move for almost all Shadow Pokémon**.

* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Shadow Pokémon such as **Shadow Tyranitar**, **Shadow Lugia (XD001)**, and the **Shadow Legendary Beasts (Entei, Raikou, Suicune)**.
* **Starter Utility:** It is the starting move for **Shadow Eevee** in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, providing essential neutral/super-effective coverage early in the game.
* **Coverage Utility:** Since the Shadow type is exclusive to "corrupted" Pokémon, it is never seen on standard competitive teams. It is primarily used to "soften" targets for Snagging (capturing from other trainers).
* **Acquisition:** Only available to Pokémon in "Shadow" form; the move is replaced during the **Purification** process and cannot be taught via TM/TR.
