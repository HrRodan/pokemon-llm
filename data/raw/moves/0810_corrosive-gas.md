## Identity & Mechanics
**Corrosive Gas** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield: Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** The user exhales or releases a dense, billowing cloud of highly caustic, acidic vapors that envelops the entire battlefield. This corrosive smog is specifically designed to target inorganic materials, instantly dissolving and melting away any items held by the targets, rendering them useless for the remainder of the encounter.
* **Effect:** Permanently removes the held items of all Pokémon hit by the move (excluding the user). Unlike *Knock Off*, the item is "melted" rather than dropped, meaning it cannot be recovered via *Recycle* or the *Harvest* ability during that battle.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the item destruction).
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Spread move; hits allies and enemies in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (Status), Accuracy 100%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Utility / Item Disruption.
* **Usage:** Corrosive Gas serves as a specialized disruption tool, particularly effective in VGC (Doubles) where removing two items at once—such as **Focus Sashes, Eviolites, or Choice items**—can instantly swing momentum. While it lacks the raw damage of *Knock Off*, it is highly effective against defensive "Stall" archetypes that rely on *Leftovers* or *Heavy-Duty Boots*. It deals **Super Effective** damage (in terms of utility) to teams dependent on item-based bulk or speed control.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses *Magic Coat* and *Magic Bounce* as it is a field-effect status move. It does not make contact, avoiding chip damage from *Rocky Helmet* or *Rough Skin*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (17 learners), primarily limited to Poison-type Pokémon and those associated with gas or toxins.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Gengar**, **Weezing (and Galarian Weezing)**, and **Salazzle**. These Pokémon often use their high Speed or defensive utility to disrupt opponents early in a match.
* **Coverage Utility:** Seen on Ultra Beasts like **Nihilego** and **Guzzlord** to provide utility options beyond their high-offense kits, allowing them to cripple defensive checks like *Blissey* or *Corviknight*.
* **Acquisition:** Originally taught via Move Tutor in the Isle of Armor (Generation VIII); it is not a standard TM/TR move, making its availability highly specific to certain games.
