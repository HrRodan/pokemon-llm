## Identity & Mechanics
**Phantom Force** is a physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user fades from reality, slipping into the shadows or the spirit world to become completely untargetable for one turn. On the following turn, the user suddenly re-emerges to ambush the target with a powerful spectral strike. This ethereal transition allows the user to bypass standard defensive barriers entirely.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn semi-invulnerable move. On the first turn, the user "vanishes" and becomes immune to most attacks (except those from Pokémon with No Guard or moves like Earthquake if the user is underground—though Ghost-types are simply "vanished"). On the second turn, it deals damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** This move **ignores and breaks through** the effects of *Protect*, *Detect*, *King's Shield*, *Spiky Shield*, *Baneful Bunker*, and *Obstruct*. It cannot be selected by *Sleep Talk*.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Semi-Invulnerable STAB / Protection Breaker.
* **Usage:** While two-turn moves are often risky because they allow the opponent to switch into a resist (like a Normal or Dark-type), Phantom Force is the premier Physical Ghost-type STAB for Pokémon that lack access to *Poltergeist*. Its ability to **pierce Protect** makes it a specialized tool in VGC (Doubles) to punish defensive play. It is often compared to *Shadow Force* (Giratina's signature move), acting as a slightly weaker but more widely distributed version. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes contact. Bypasses protection moves.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (58 learners), primarily concentrated among Ghost-type specialists.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Dragapult**, **Giratina**, **Ceruledge**, and **Annihilape**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on physical attackers like **Mew** or **Dragapult** (who often lacks physical Ghost-type alternatives) to provide reliable STAB or neutral coverage against neutral threats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple for physical Ghost-type builds in the modern meta.
