## Identity & Mechanics
**Psyblade** is a physical Psychic-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user manifests a shimmering, ethereal blade of focused psychic energy to rend the target with a surgical strike. This move represents a fusion of telekinetic power and physical combat, often associated with high-tech or futuristic combatants. Under the influence of **Electric Terrain**, the blade's energy resonates, increasing its cutting power by 50%.
* **Effect:** Deals standard damage. Its base power increases from 80 to **120** if the user is grounded on Electric Terrain.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power modification based on field conditions).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80 (120 in Electric Terrain), Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Terrain-Dependent Nuke.**
* **Usage:** In its base form, Psyblade is a high-consistency physical Psychic STAB move, outperforming *Zen Headbutt* due to its perfect accuracy. When paired with **Electric Terrain** (often set by Miraidon or Pincurchin), it becomes a devastating nuke, rivaling the power of *Close Combat* or *Double-Edge* without the defensive drawbacks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Slicing move**, meaning its power is further boosted by 50% if used by a Pokémon with the **Sharpness** ability. It makes **Contact** with the target.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (1 learner), serving as a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently the signature move of **Iron Leaves**, the Future Paradox form of Virizion. 
* **Synergy:** Iron Leaves is designed to excel in Electric Terrain thanks to its **Quark Drive** ability; Psyblade doubles down on this synergy, allowing Iron Leaves to become a premier wallbreaker in "Future" themed teams.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not currently available via TM/TR or to non-Psychic types, making its presence highly predictable yet difficult to switch into when the terrain is active.
* **Acquisition:** Exclusively learned by **Iron Leaves** upon capture or via Move Reminder.
