## Identity & Mechanics
**Minimize** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user compresses its body cells and shrinks to a miniature size, drastically reducing its physical profile. By becoming a smaller target, the user becomes significantly more elusive, making it difficult for opponents to land successful attacks. This physical transformation persists while the user is active on the field, though it makes the user vulnerable to being crushed by heavy-weighted moves.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s **Evasion** stat by **two stages** (+2). Note: In Generations I-IV, it only raised evasion by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** While minimized, the user takes **double damage** from specific "crushing" moves, including **Stomp**, **Steamroller**, **Body Slam**, **Dragon Rush**, **Flying Press**, **Heat Crash**, and **Malicious Moonsault**. These moves also bypass accuracy checks to hit the minimized target 100% of the time.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Evasion Setup / Stall Reinforcement.
* **Usage:** Minimize is a high-variance utility move primarily used to force "misses" and drain the opponent's PP or momentum. It is significantly more efficient than *Double Team* as it provides a +2 boost in a single turn. It is most effective on "Wall" Pokémon with high HP or recovery. Due to its reliance on RNG (luck), it is frequently **banned** in competitive formats under the **Evasion Clause**. It deals no damage directly and therefore has no **Super Effective** profile, but it is effectively neutralized by moves with the "No Guard" ability or "Always-Hit" moves like *Swift* or *Aura Sphere*.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; bypasses Protect/Detect if used by the user, but the effects are only beneficial to the user.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution (22 learners), restricted primarily to amorphous, gelatinous, or magical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Chansey** and **Blissey**, who use it to become unkillable "Pink Blobs" when paired with Soft-Boiled. It is also a staple for **Clefable** (often paired with Cosmic Power or Stored Power) and **Alolan Muk**, who uses it to stack defenses in tight corridors.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Drifblim** or **Chandelure** to buy turns for setup or to utilize *Baton Pass* (in generations where evasion passing is permitted) to transition the evasion boosts to a sweeper.
* **Acquisition:** Rarely available as a TM; it is mostly learned through natural level-up or as an Egg Move in specific biological groups.
