## Identity & Mechanics
**Bitter Malice** is a Special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically debuted in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user manifests its intense, spine-chilling resentment into a spectral assault. This move channels the spite of the departed to strike the target with a freezing, ghostly aura that saps their vitality and willpower.
* **Effect:** This move deals double damage (increasing from a base 75 to **150 power**) if the target is currently afflicted by a status condition (e.g., Paralysis, Burn, Sleep, Poison, or Frostbite).
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a chance (typically 30% in its original appearance) to leave the target with **Frostbite** (a condition that deals damage over time and halves the target's Special Attack). 
    * *Note: In later iterations like Generation IX, the secondary effect was updated to guaranteedly lower the target's Attack stat by one stage.*
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75 (150 if status), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Conditional Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Bitter Malice functions as an upgraded version of *Hex*. While it has a slightly higher base power than *Shadow Ball* (80) when the target is status-afflicted, its primary value comes from the synergy with status-spreading teammates or the move's own secondary effect. It is a **High-Risk/High-Reward** option that punishes switches into status or Pokémon already suffering from persistent conditions. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based spectral move. It is not blocked by *Bulletproof* but is resisted by Dark-types and ignored by Normal-types.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 learners), serving as the signature move for a specific regional form.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Hisuian Zoroark** and its pre-evolution **Hisuian Zorua**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is rarely seen on other Pokémon. However, on Hisuian Zoroark, it provides a powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option that complements its Normal/Ghost typing, allowing it to threaten Psychic-type walls like Slowbro or Ghost-type rivals like Gengar.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally through leveling up by the Hisuian Zorua line.
