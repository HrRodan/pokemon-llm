## Identity & Mechanics
**Twin Beam** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IX.
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental energy and projects two consecutive mystical rays from its eyes. This psychic assault manifests as two distinct beams of light that strike the target in rapid succession, making it effective at overwhelming defensive barriers and mental fortitude.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and hits the target twice in a single turn. Each hit has its own calculation for critical hits and damage rolls.
* **Secondary Effect:** 0% (No additional status effects).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40 (Total 80), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Multi-hit STAB / Utility Attacker.
* **Usage:** While its base power is slightly lower than *Psychic* (90 BP) or *Psyshock* (80 BP), Twin Beam excels as a **Focus Sash** and **Sturdy** breaker. Because it hits twice, the first hit can break a Substitute or a Focus Sash, allowing the second hit to deal direct damage or secure a KO. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Multi-hit move; bypasses "Disguise" (Mimikyu) or "Ice Face" (Eiscue) to deal damage with the second strike.
