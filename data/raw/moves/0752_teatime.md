## Identity & Mechanics
**Teatime** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user orchestrates an elegant mid-battle gathering, forcing every active participant on the field to immediately consume their held Berry. This move visualizes a sophisticated social ritual that overrides the standard HP or status thresholds usually required for Berry activation.
* **Effect:** Forces all Pokémon on the field (including the user and allies) to eat their held Berries immediately, regardless of current HP or status conditions. This bypasses abilities like Unnerve or effects like Magic Room that usually prevent Berry consumption.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Pokémon (hits the user, allies, and all opponents).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 10.
* **Role:** Field-Wide Utility / Item Manipulation.
* **Usage:** Extremely niche and situational. Its primary value lies in **Doubles** or **VGC** formats where it can be used to manually trigger a teammate’s beneficial Berry (such as a Stat-boosting Starf/Lansat Berry or a Damage-reducing Berry) before the opponent can react or knock them out. It also serves as a disruptive "anti-item" tool to force an opponent to waste a Sitrus or Lum Berry prematurely. It deals **neutral** utility impact regardless of type matchups but is most effective against teams reliant on **Harvest** or **Ripen** strategies.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses **Protect** and **Substitute**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Teatime has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move for a specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Polteageist**. As its signature move, it fits the thematic identity of the "Black Tea Pokémon." 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not used for coverage but rather as a specialized tactical option for teams built specifically around Polteageist’s unique utility.
* **Acquisition:** Only available through leveling up the Polteageist line; it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor teaching in any generation.
