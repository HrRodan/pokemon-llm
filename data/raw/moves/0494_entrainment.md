## Identity & Mechanics
**Entrainment** is a **Status Normal-type** move introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** The user performs a hypnotic, rhythmic dance that forces the target to synchronize its movements. This mystical rhythm suppresses the target's natural traits, compelling them to mimic the user’s behavior and effectively replacing the target's Ability with the user’s own. This is a powerful tool for ability manipulation and field control.
* **Effect:** Changes the target’s Ability to match the user’s current Ability. The effect persists until the target is switched out or the battle ends.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to modify ability upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target; can target allies in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Utility / Support / Ability Disruption.**
* **Usage:** Unlike offensive moves, Entrainment is used for tactical **Ability Suppression**. In Singles, it is famously used by **Durant** to pass the detrimental *Truant* ability to opponents, forcing them to waste every other turn. In Doubles (VGC), it is a high-level **Support** move used to pass beneficial abilities (like *Water Bubble* or *Levitate*) to an ally or to strip a foe of a defensive backbone like *Multiscale* or *Unaware*.
* **Attributes:** This move is **Reflected** by Magic Coat/Magic Bounce and is blocked by **Protect/Detect**. It fails if the user or target has certain unique abilities (e.g., *Stance Change*, *Multitype*, or *RKS System*).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **moderate** distribution, primarily found among expressive or "dancing" Pokémon (34 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Durant:** Iconic for the "Truant + Entrainment" strategy, often paired with *Shadow Tag* or *Arena Trap* in higher-tier niche builds.
    * **Araquanid:** Uses it in Doubles to pass its incredibly powerful *Water Bubble* ability to teammates, doubling their Water-type damage.
    * **Lopunny / Mega Lopunny:** Often carries it to disrupt opponents who rely on specific defensive abilities.
    * **Audino:** Utilizes it as a support tool in lower competitive tiers to reset or overwrite dangerous enemy buffs.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it doesn't deal damage, it is frequently seen on **Lilligant (Hisuian and Unovan)** and **Pangoro** to neutralize "Wall" abilities like *Regenerator* or *Poison Heal*.
* **Acquisition:** Entrainment is primarily learned via **Level Up** or **Egg Move** inheritance; it has historically not been available as a TM or TR, making its distribution relatively exclusive.
