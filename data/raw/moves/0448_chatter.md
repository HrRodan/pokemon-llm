## Identity & Mechanics
**Chatter** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user lets out a cacophony of mimicked speech and rhythmic sound waves. By utilizing words it has learned from its environment, the user creates a disorienting sonic assault that rattles the target's concentration. This move is unique for its historical integration with the Nintendo DS microphone, allowing players to record their own audio to determine the move's secondary effect potency.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and carries a secondary chance to Confuse the target. In modern generations (Gen VI onwards), the confusion chance is **100%**. Historically, the confusion rate was determined by the volume of a microphone recording (1%, 11%, or 31%).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance (Modern) to inflict **Confusion**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Disruption Utility / Guaranteed Status Infliction.
* **Usage:** While its base power is modest, Chatter serves as a powerful disruption tool because it is a **Sound-based move**. This allows it to **bypass Substitute**, hitting the opponent directly and guaranteeing a confusion proc (in later games). It is often used to force switches or disrupt setup sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute, blocked by Soundproof). It cannot be copied by Mirror Move or Sketch, nor can it be called by Metronome or Assist.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, as it is the **Signature Move** of only one Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Chatot**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. On Chatot, it is the primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, often paired with a *Focus Sash* or *Choice Specs* to maximize its disruptive potential before the user faints.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via level-up for Chatot. It has never been made available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor for other species.
