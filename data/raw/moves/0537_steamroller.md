## Identity & Mechanics
**Steamroller** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user curls its body into a tight, armored sphere and builds massive momentum to flatten the target, trampling them under its weight. This aggressive rolling motion is designed to crush the opposition into submission, often leaving them momentarily stunned or unable to react.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target has used the move **Minimize**, Steamroller deals double damage (130 base power) and bypasses any accuracy checks to hit the target despite their increased evasion.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Niche Utility.
* **Usage:** Steamroller is primarily a "Consistency Option" used during the leveling process. In competitive play, it is generally outclassed by **X-Scissor** (higher base power) or **Megahorn** (massive nuke potential). However, its 30% flinch rate gives it a "para-flinch" niche on faster users, and its unique interaction with **Minimize** makes it a hard counter to evasion-stacking strategies (though such strategies are rare in standard Smogon formats). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic,** and **Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (6 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with spherical or segmented bodies capable of rolling.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by the **Scolipede** line (**Venipede, Whirlipede, Scolipede**) as a natural STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) progression.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by **Golem** and **Alolan Golem** to provide Bug-type coverage against Grass-type threats that otherwise threaten their Rock/Ground/Electric typing. The Ultra Beast **Guzzlord** also has access to it, using its massive bulk to fish for flinches.
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is not available via **TM or TR** in any generation, making it a "Level-up only" move for its select few users.
