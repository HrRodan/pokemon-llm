## Identity & Mechanics
**Crafty Shield** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user weaves a shimmering, mystical barrier of Fairy energy around itself and its allies. This protective veil acts as a dedicated filter, specifically neutralizing incoming non-damaging techniques such as status-inflicting moves, stat-lowering debuffs, and tactical interference.
* **Effect:** Protects all friendly Pokémon on the user’s side of the field from the effects of non-damaging (Status) moves for the remainder of the turn. Unlike standard protection moves like Protect or Detect, Crafty Shield has a unique property: its success rate does not decrease when used consecutively.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it operates at **+3 Priority**, allowing it to outspeed most standard attacks and many support moves.
* **Targeting:** User’s Field (Affects the user and all active allies in Doubles/Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Specialized Defensive Utility / Anti-Meta Support.
* **Usage:** Crafty Shield is a niche but potent tool primarily used in **Doubles and VGC** formats. It is the hard counter to "Prankster" ability users and status-reliant archetypes. It effectively shuts down threats like **Spore, Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, Encore, and Thunder Wave**. Because it can be used every turn without failing, it can permanently lock out an opponent’s utility Pokémon while the user's ally focuses on dealing damage. It does not hit any types for damage, but it provides a "Super Effective" defensive response against **Dark, Ghost, and Grass** types that frequently rely on status-based disruption.
* **Attributes:** Priority Move (+3); Bypasses Accuracy checks; Does not protect against damaging moves (even those with secondary status effects like Scald).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, limited to only 8 specific Pokémon, mostly consisting of sentient objects or mystical entities.
* **Prominent Users:** It is most famously utilized by **Klefki**, which can use its own Prankster ability to ensure priority, and the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna**, which uses it to protect its sweeping potential from being halted by Taunt or paralysis. **Cofagrigus** and **Runerigus** also utilize it in trickier support sets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature or near-signature move for many of its learners, it is rarely seen as "coverage." However, in restricted formats, it is a vital pick on **Magearna** to counter Smeargle or Amoonguss strategies.
* **Acquisition:** Very restricted; it is **not available as a TM or TR** in any generation, making it exclusive to the natural level-up sets of its specific learners.
