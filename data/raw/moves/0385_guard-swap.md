## Identity & Mechanics
**Guard Swap** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user exerts intense psychic pressure to tether its own defensive aura to the opponent, causing an instantaneous exchange of momentum. Specifically, it swaps the user's current **Defense and Special Defense stat stage modifiers** with those of the target. This does not affect base stats, only the "plus" or "minus" changes accumulated during the battle.
* **Effect:** The user and the target trade their stat stage changes for Defense and Special Defense. For example, if the target has +2 Defense and the user has -1 Defense, after using Guard Swap, the user will have +2 and the target will have -1.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses accuracy checks), PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Counter-Setup / Gimmick.
* **Usage:** Guard Swap is a niche technical choice primarily used to punish **Setup Sweepers** or **Walls** that rely on moves like Iron Defense, Acid Armor, or Cosmic Power. By "stealing" these boosts, a frail Pokémon can suddenly become incredibly durable while leaving the opponent vulnerable. It can also be used proactively to "dump" negative defensive modifiers (gained from moves like *Close Combat* or *Superpower*) onto an opponent. It is often compared to **Power Swap** (the offensive equivalent) and is generally considered more situational than **Haze** or **Clear Smog**.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Psychic-type status move; notably, it targets the opponent and ignores accuracy/evasion checks, but it can be reflected by **Magic Coat** or blocked by **Magic Bounce**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (78 total learners), found mostly among Psychic-types and Pokémon with high intellectual or mystical themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with technical Psychic-types like **Alakazam**, **Mr. Mime**, and **Gardevoir**, who use it to compensate for their natural frailty. It is also found on legendary powerhouses like **Mewtwo** and **Zamazenta (Crowned Shield)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on defensive utility Pokémon like **Bronzong**, **Claydol**, or **Carbink** to reset their own debuffs or disrupt an opponent's defensive core.
* **Acquisition:** It has seen varying availability over the years, most notably featuring as **TR44** in Pokémon Sword & Shield, making it widely accessible to many Psychic and Steel types in that generation.
