## Identity & Mechanics
**Continental Crush (Physical)** is a Physical Rock-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Powered by the resonance between a Trainer and their Pokémon via Rockium Z, the user manifests its internal strength to summon a colossal, mountain-sized rock formation from the earth. The user then hurls or drops this geological mass onto the target with tectonic force, crushing them beneath its immense weight.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used if the Pokémon holds a **Rockium Z** and knows a physical Rock-type move (such as Stone Edge or Rock Slide). It deals massive damage based on the power of the original base move and typically ignores accuracy checks to ensure a hit.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Z-Moves generally lose the secondary effects of their base moves unless they are Status-Z moves).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** One-time Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Continental Crush is primarily used to bypass the shaky accuracy of Rock-type moves like **Stone Edge** while providing a massive burst of damage to OHKO (One-Hit Knock Out) a specific threat. In the Gen VII competitive meta, it served as a premier tool for physical attackers to lure in and destroy defensive checks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy/evasion checks; damage is reduced if the opponent uses *Protect* (dealing 25% of the original damage) rather than being completely negated.
