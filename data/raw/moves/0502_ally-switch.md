## Identity & Mechanics
**Ally Switch** is a status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user teleports using a strange psychic power, instantly distorting the battlefield to switch its place with an adjacent ally. This maneuver is a hallmark of high-level doubles play, forcing opponents into "50/50" guessing games and punishing targeted attacks by repositioning defensive or offensive threats mid-turn.
* **Effect:** The user and its chosen ally swap positions on the field. In modern generations (Gen 8+), this move has a higher failure rate if used consecutively. It fails in Single Battles or if the user is in the middle of a Triple Battle without a clear target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Status).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user and one adjacent ally. It possesses a **+2 Priority** bracket, allowing it to execute before most standard attacks.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Mind Game Utility / Defensive Pivot.**
* **Usage:** Ally Switch is one of the most polarizing moves in competitive Doubles (VGC). It is used to protect a "glass cannon" teammate from a lethal hit by swapping in a bulky resistance or immunity. Unlike *Follow Me*, it bypasses certain redirection-ignoring mechanics and repositions the Pokémon for the next turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **N/A** (Status move), but effectively "counters" any type by swapping in a teammate that resists the incoming move.
* **Attributes:** Priority move (+2); Bypasses Protect (as it targets the user/ally); Not blocked by Taunt-induced redirection-blocking.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (212 learners), making it a frequent threat in team preview.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Cresselia**, **Dusclops**, and **Calyrex-Shadow** to maximize their defensive utility or offensive pressure through positioning.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Dragapult**, **Cinderace**, and **Rotom-Wash** to provide unexpected support and disrupt the opponent's targeting.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation V and Generation VIII (SWSH), though its availability was significantly reduced in Generation IX.
