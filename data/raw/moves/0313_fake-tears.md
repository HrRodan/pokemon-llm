## Identity & Mechanics
**Fake Tears** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user feigns distress, crying crocodile tears to manipulate the target's emotions and catch them off guard. This psychological ploy causes the opponent to lower their guard, creating a significant opening for special attacks. As a Dark-type status move, it carries the thematic weight of deception and underhanded tactics.
* **Effect:** Sharply lowers the target’s Special Defense stat by two stages (-2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% guaranteed success unless blocked by abilities or type immunities).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

* **Attributes:** Since Generation VII, Dark-type Pokémon are immune to this move if it is used by a Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability. It does not make contact and is not blocked by *Bulletproof*.
