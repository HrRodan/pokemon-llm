## Identity & Mechanics
**Sparkling Aria** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user releases a rhythmic, shimmering burst of song that manifests as a multitude of glowing bubbles. These bubbles resonate with a soothing frequency; while they deal significant impact damage to opponents, their therapeutic properties instantly quench flames. This move is categorized as a **Sound-based move**, allowing it to bypass a target's **Substitute**.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent Pokémon. If a target hit by this move is currently suffering from a **Burn**, that burn is cured immediately after the damage is dealt.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to heal the target's Burn status upon contact with the bubbles.
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Spread Attacker**.
* **Usage:** Primarily functions as a specialized alternative to *Surf*. While it shares the same Power and Accuracy, Sparkling Aria is a **Sound-based move**, which is a massive advantage for bypassing **Substitute** and interacting with abilities like **Liquid Voice** or **Soundproof**. However, its secondary effect is a double-edged sword; it can inadvertently help an opponent by curing a burn inflicted by a teammate's *Will-O-Wisp* or *Scald*. In VGC/Doubles, it is used as a spread-damage option that can occasionally be used to heal a burned physical-attacking ally. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute, blocked by Soundproof, triggers Throat Spray), Non-contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), making it one of the most exclusive Water-type moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Primarina**, which often pairs it with the **Liquid Voice** ability (though the move is already Water-type, it benefits from sound-based buffs) or uses it to bypass Substitutes in competitive singles. **Lapras** is the only other Pokémon capable of learning this move (typically via specific event distributions or breeding in later generations).
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme rarity, it is almost never seen as a coverage option on non-Water types. Its utility is strictly limited to the **Primarina** evolutionary line and **Lapras**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is primarily learned through leveling up (Primarina) or as a rare Egg Move/Special Move (Lapras).
