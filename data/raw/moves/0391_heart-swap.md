## Identity & Mechanics
**Heart Swap** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user employs its profound psychic power to forge a mystical connection with the target, causing their hearts and spirits to resonate until their current conditions are interchanged. This maneuver effectively swaps all stat stage increases and decreases between the user and the opponent, making it a powerful tool for turning an opponent's momentum against them.
* **Effect:** The user and the target swap all current stat modifiers (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% effect execution).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Tactical Utility / Anti-Setup Specialist.
* **Usage:** Heart Swap is a high-skill ceiling move used primarily to punish "Set-up Sweepers." While moves like *Haze* or *Clear Smog* simply reset stats, Heart Swap allows the user to "steal" a foe's hard-earned boosts (such as +6 Attack from a Belly Drum) or "gift" the foe with the user's own stat penalties (such as the Special Attack drops from *Fleur Cannon* or *Overheat*). 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal direct damage to **Fighting** or **Poison** types, but it is notable for being one of the few Psychic moves that can be effectively utilized regardless of the opponent's type resistances, though it is blocked by *Magic Coat* and the *Magic Bounce* ability.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; check-blocked by *Substitute* in earlier generations but interacts with it differently depending on the specific game engine.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (3 total learners), categorized as a **Signature Move** for specific Mythical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Manaphy** (its original signature user) and **Magearna** (including its Original Color form).
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Magearna**, Heart Swap is a terrifying competitive tool; it can use *Fleur Cannon* to deal massive damage, then use Heart Swap to transfer the resulting -2 Special Attack debuff to the opponent while stealing the opponent's positive boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is strictly limited to the level-up sets of the aforementioned Mythical Pokémon.
