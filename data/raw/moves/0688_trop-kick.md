* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s **Attack** stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single enemy.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) / Physical Check.
* **Usage:** While its base power is modest compared to heavy hitters like *Power Whip* or *Leaf Blade*, Trop Kick is highly valued for its **guaranteed disruption**. By lowering the opponent's Attack every turn, the user can effectively "neuter" physical sweepers, making it an excellent tool for trading hits and increasing the user's effective physical bulk. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is categorized as a **Kick** move, though it is not currently boosted by the ability *Mega Launcher* (which affects pulse moves) or *Iron Fist*. However, it interacts with contact-based abilities like *Rough Skin* or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, serving as a signature move for its primary user (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Tsareena**. It is the defining move of the Fruit Pokémon, often required for its evolution from Steenee and serving as its primary STAB option in competitive formats like VGC and Smogon tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found as coverage on non-Grass types. On Tsareena, it is used to punish physical switch-ins such as **Landorus-Therian** or **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike**, softening their blows while dealing consistent damage.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned exclusively by **Tsareena** upon evolution or through level-up.
