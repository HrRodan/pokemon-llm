## Identity & Mechanics
**Spikes** is a Status Ground-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user scatters sharp, pointed traps across the opposing side of the battlefield. These protrusions pierce the feet or undersides of incoming Pokémon, inflicting consistent chip damage based on the density of the hazard field. As a Ground-type entry hazard, it is designed to punish frequent switching and break Focus Sashes or Sturdy abilities.
* **Effect:** Sets a layer of spikes on the opponent's side of the field. Incoming Pokémon take damage based on the number of layers active: 1 layer deals 1/8 (12.5%) max HP, 2 layers deal 3/16 (18.75%) max HP, and 3 layers deal 1/4 (25%) max HP. Pokémon immune to Ground-type moves (Flying-types, those with Levitate, or those holding Air Balloons) are immune to this damage unless **Gravity** is active or they are holding an **Iron Ball**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is cleared by **Rapid Spin**, **Mortal Spin**, **Tidy Up**, and **Defog**.
* **Targeting:** Opponent's side of the field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Entry Hazard / Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** Spikes is a cornerstone of "Hazard Stack" archetypes. Unlike Stealth Rock, which is a one-turn setup, Spikes requires multiple turns to reach maximum potency but rewards the investment by dealing massive, non-resistible damage to grounded foes. It is often paired with "Spinblockers" (Ghost-types) to prevent the opponent from using Rapid Spin. While it is a Ground-type move, it does not factor in type weaknesses; it deals flat percentage damage to all grounded targets regardless of their typing.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Wonder Guard**. Accuracy checks are ignored as it targets the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (90 learners), predominantly found among Steel, Poison, and Rock-type defensive anchors.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically defined by **Skarmory**, **Ferrothorn**, and **Forretress**. In the current meta, the legendary **Ting-Lu** and the defensive wall **Clodsire** are premier setters.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on offensive "Hazard Lead" or "Pivot" Pokémon like **Greninja**, **Meowscarada**, and **Glimmora** to pressure the opponent into uncomfortable switches while maintaining offensive momentum.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible as a **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple on various team archetypes.
