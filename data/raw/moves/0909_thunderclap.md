## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunderclap** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (The Indigo Disk DLC).
* **Description:** The user gathers a sudden, deafening surge of electrical energy and discharges it in a flash to intercept an opponent's strike. It is a high-speed reactive move that allows a Special attacker to seize the initiative, provided the opponent is actively preparing an offensive maneuver.
* **Effect:** This move has a **Priority of +1**, allowing the user to strike before the target. However, the move **fails** if the target is not using a damaging move (Physical or Special) or if the target has already acted in the turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **70**, Accuracy **100%**, PP **5** (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Priority Revenge Killer** / **Anti-Offense Utility**.
* **Usage:** Thunderclap is the Special-category counterpart to the move **Sucker Punch**. It is a meta-defining tool for Special attackers with middling speed, allowing them to bypass faster, frail sweepers. Because it relies on the opponent attacking, it can be bypassed by Status moves (Protect, Substitute, Will-O-Wisp). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **non-contact** Special attack. Its low PP (5) makes it susceptible to "Pressure" stalling and requires careful management in longer battles.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is currently the signature move of a specific Paradox Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Raging Bolt** (the Paradox relative of Raikou). 
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not currently seen on other Pokémon. For **Raging Bolt**, it serves as its most vital tool, compensating for its low base Speed and allowing it to function as a "Special Tank" that can pick off weakened threats like **Iron Bundle**, **Enamorus**, or **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned naturally by Raging Bolt upon capture or via Move Reminder.
