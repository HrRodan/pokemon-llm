## Identity & Mechanics
**Smokescreen** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user releases an opaque cloud of thick smoke, soot, or ink, completely obscuring the battlefield and the opponent's line of sight. This tactical obfuscation forces the target to struggle with their aim, creating a shroud that makes landing attacks significantly more difficult.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target's Accuracy stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The accuracy drop is the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Disruption.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Smokescreen is rarely used in favor of more definitive status moves like *Will-O-Wisp* or *Thunder Wave*. While lowering accuracy can force a switch (making it a "phazing" tool of sorts), it is often considered "hax-reliant" (dependent on luck). It is functionally identical to *Sand Attack* and *Flash*, though its Normal typing means it can hit most targets. It does not deal damage, so it has no **Super Effective** profile, but it is effective against any Pokémon not protected by abilities like **Clear Body**, **White Smoke**, or **Keen Eye**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect/Detect** in very specific early-gen iterations (though generally blocked in modern play). It is a non-contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (38 total learners), primarily concentrated among Fire-types, Poison-types, and "ninja-themed" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fire-type starters like **Charizard**, **Typhlosion**, and the tactical Water/Dark-type **Greninja**. It is also a signature flavor move for the **Koffing** and **Magmar** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on defensive or technical Pokémon like **Torkoal**, **Coalossal**, and **Kingdra** (representing ink) to disrupt setup sweepers during in-game playthroughs.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via **Level Up**. It is notably absent from the TM/TR lists in most generations, making its distribution strictly tied to the natural movepools of smoke-producing or ink-spraying species.
