## Identity & Mechanics
**Harden** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user stiffens its muscles, tenses its skin, or hardens its outer shell to become as rigid as stone or metal. This physical fortification increases the user's structural integrity, allowing it to better withstand physical impact and direct strikes.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Defense stat by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game Setup / Defensive Utility.
* **Usage:** In the competitive landscape, Harden is generally considered a "Budget" setup move. It is almost strictly outclassed by **Iron Defense** or **Acid Armor**, which provide a +2 Defense boost, or **Bulk Up**, which provides offensive pressure alongside the defensive buff. It is most frequently encountered in early-game "Nuzlocke" scenarios or low-level play. Its primary purpose is to mitigate damage from **Physical Attackers**, though its low stat-increment makes it less efficient for stalling than more potent defensive options.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage. However, it provides defensive utility against types that rely on physical contact, such as **Fighting**, **Rock**, and **Steel**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the user; not affected by "Contact" mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (105 learners), typically associated with Pokémon that possess shells, carapaces, or mineral bodies.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to "Cocoon" Pokémon like **Metapod** and **Kakuna**; also a staple level-up move for **Onix**, **Aggron**, and **Golem**.
* **Recent Notable Users:** Frequently seen in the early-game move pools of **Garganacl**, **Orthworm**, and **Glimmora**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not used for "coverage" in the traditional offensive sense, it is a common natural tool for Rock and Steel types to bolster their already high base Defense.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is rarely featured as a TM or TR, as it is considered a fundamental "natural" ability for many armored Pokémon.
