## Identity & Mechanics
**Triple Axel** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield: Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** The user executes a series of three spinning, frost-infused kicks. The freezing centrifugal force increases the momentum of each strike, causing the impact to become significantly more powerful with each successive hit.
* **Effect:** This is a multi-hit move that strikes up to three times. The base power increases with each hit: the first hit has 20 power, the second has 40, and the third has 60. If all three hits connect, the total base power reaches a devastating **120**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Each hit has an independent accuracy check. If one hit misses, the move ends immediately. This move is categorized as a **Contact** move.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20 (Base), Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Triple Axel serves as the premier high-ceiling damage option for physical Ice-types. It is often preferred over **Icicle Crash** for its higher potential damage (120 vs 85) and its ability to bypass **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, and **Substitute** by breaking them with the initial hits. However, because accuracy is checked for each kick, the probability of landing all three hits is approximately **72.9%**, making it a "high-risk, high-reward" choice. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ground, Flying,** and **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Contact; affected by items like **Rocky Helmet** or abilities like **Rough Skin** (which trigger on every hit, potentially dealing massive recoil to the user). It is boosted by the **Wide Lens** item to improve reliability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (45 learners), primarily granted to nimble attackers or dancers.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Weavile**, **Meowscarada** (via Protean or coverage), and **Alolan Sandslash**. It is a signature-style coverage move for **Tsareena** and **Quaquaval**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Fighting-types like **Pheromosa**, **Hitmontop**, and **Gallade** to punish 4x Ice-weak threats like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite.
* **Acquisition:** Introduced as a Move Tutor move in the Galar region and later became available as a **TM** in Generation IX (The Indigo Disk).
