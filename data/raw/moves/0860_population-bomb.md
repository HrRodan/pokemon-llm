## Identity & Mechanics
**Population Bomb** is a physical Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user summons a massive group of its kin to swarm the opponent, delivering a relentless barrage of coordinated strikes. This move is a multi-hit physical assault where the "family" unit of the user overwhelms the target through sheer numbers, hitting up to ten times in a single turn.
* **Effect:** The move attempts to hit the target **1 to 10 times**. Uniquely, the move performs an accuracy check for every individual hit; if any hit fails to connect, the move immediately ends.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it functions as a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin on every successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20 (Per hit), Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Signature Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** While a base power of 20 seems low, the potential for 10 hits creates a massive **200 Base Power** ceiling. When combined with the ability **Technician**, each hit is boosted to 30, resulting in a staggering **300 Base Power** move before STAB. It is almost exclusively paired with the **Wide Lens** item to boost the accuracy of each check to 99%, ensuring a high probability of landing all 10 hits. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **completely ineffective against Ghost types** and is resisted by **Rock and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Contact move; Multi-hit mechanic (synergizes with Loaded Dice or Wide Lens).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, being the signature move of a specific evolutionary line (3 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized almost exclusively by **Maushold** (both Family of Three and Family of Four forms). In competitive play, Maushold uses this move to "clean" or "sweep" weakened teams.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. However, Maushold uses it as its primary STAB offensive pressure, often forcing opponents to switch into Ghost-types or Pokémon holding a **Rocky Helmet** to punish the multiple contact hits.
* **Acquisition:** Signature move; learned via level-up by the Tandemaus line. It is **not available as a TM/TR**.
