## Identity & Mechanics
**Draining Kiss** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user approaches the target and steals its vital life energy through a mystical kiss. This vampiric Fairy-type attack drains the target's essence to replenish the user's health, manifesting as a pink heart-themed energy transfer. It is a key tool for Fairy types looking to maintain longevity during a battle.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and restores the user's HP by **75%** of the damage dealt. This is significantly higher than the standard 50% restoration seen in moves like Giga Drain or Drain Punch.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Sustain-based Utility / Setup Sweeper Recovery.** 
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Draining Kiss is a niche "Consistency Option" for bulky setup sweepers. It is frequently paired with **Calm Mind**; as the user boosts their Special Attack, the damage (and subsequently the healing) scales, allowing the Pokémon to stay healthy without burning a turn on non-damaging recovery moves. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**. Despite being a Special attack, it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Static.
