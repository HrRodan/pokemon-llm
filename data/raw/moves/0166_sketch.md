## Identity & Mechanics
**Sketch** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user carefully observes and replicates the target's technique, permanently etching the mechanics of the move into its own memory. This artistic mimicry allows the user to bypass its biological limitations, gaining access to nearly any offensive, defensive, or utility move in existence. 
* **Effect:** Permanently replaces "Sketch" with the last move used by the target. Once the move is sketched, it remains in the user's move slot even after the battle concludes. The move fails if the target has not moved yet, or if the target's last move was Chatter or Struggle. It cannot be used to copy itself.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. This move is a permanent mechanical transformation.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 1.
* **Role:** Universal Utility / Customizable Toolset.
* **Usage:** Sketch is unique because it is not used in competitive battles to achieve an immediate effect, but rather to **build a moveset** that would otherwise be impossible. It allows the user to bypass the standard "Movepool" restrictions of the game. It is the foundation for creating the ultimate **Utility Lead** or **Hazard Setter**. While it deals no damage, the resulting move can hit any type for **Super Effective** damage depending on what was copied.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; fails against targets behind a Substitute (in certain generations); cannot be called by Metronome, Assist, or Sleep Talk; cannot be forced by Encore.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of only **1** Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Smeargle**. Smeargle learns Sketch every 10 levels (Level 1, 11, 21, etc.), allowing it to eventually possess a fully customized four-move kit.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Smeargle can Sketch any move, it is frequently seen carrying "illegal" combinations to counter top-tier threats. Common competitive sets include **Spore** (100% Sleep), **Sticky Web** (Speed Control), **Stealth Rock** (Hazards), and **niche pivots** like **Parting Shot** or **V-create**. It is the only non-Legendary Pokémon capable of using signature moves like **Geomancy** or **Dragon Ascent**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR/HM. Acquisition is strictly limited to Smeargle’s level-up learnset or through Move Tutor/Reminder mechanics in specific generations.
