## Identity & Mechanics
**Zippy Zap** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically debuting in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!*.
* **Description:** The user charges with surging electricity and strikes the opponent with a lightning-fast burst of energy. This move is characterized by its overwhelming speed and precision, designed to bypass the opponent's reactions entirely by saturating the air with high-voltage discharge.
* **Effect:** This move possesses a **Priority of +2**, allowing it to outspeed standard priority moves like Quick Attack or Sucker Punch. Additionally, it is guaranteed to result in a **Critical Hit**, bypassing the target's defensive stat stages and the user's offensive stat drops.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to land a Critical Hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Elite Priority Nuke / Revenge Killer.
* **Usage:** Zippy Zap is one of the most powerful priority moves in the franchise. With a base power of 80 and a guaranteed critical hit (1.5x multiplier), its effective base power is **120**, further boosted by STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). This allows the user to pick off weakened threats or even OHKO frail offensive Pokémon before they can move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a physical contact move that ignores the target's Defense boosts due to the auto-crit mechanic, making it an excellent tool against "setup sweepers" who rely on Iron Defense or Acid Armor.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a signature "Partner Move."
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Partner Pikachu** (*Pikachu-Starter*). It was designed specifically to elevate the starter Pikachu to a tier of power capable of competing with fully evolved Pokémon.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not seen as coverage on other Pokémon. However, its existence forces opponents to respect the threat of a +2 priority move that cannot be mitigated by traditional defensive buffs.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is taught specifically by Move Tutors in the *Let's Go* series and remains a rare, signature mechanic of the special starter Pikachu.
