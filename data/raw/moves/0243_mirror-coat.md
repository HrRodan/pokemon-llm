## Identity & Mechanics
**Mirror Coat** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user surrounds itself with a shimmering, reflective aura of psychic energy. Instead of attacking directly, it waits for the opponent to strike first, absorbing the impact of a special energy-based blast and refracting it back at double the intensity. It is the special-category counterpart to the move Counter.
* **Effect:** A decreased-priority move that retaliates against the last Pokémon to hit the user with a **Special Attack** during the same turn. It inflicts damage equal to exactly **twice the HP lost** by the user. While it is a Psychic-type move, it ignores type effectiveness (except for Dark-type immunity) to deal fixed damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Targets the specific opponent that last hit the user with a Special move.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Retaliation / Anti-Special Nuke.
* **Usage:** Mirror Coat is a high-reward "punishment" tool used primarily by bulky tanks to OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) Special Attackers who cannot finish them in one blow. Because it has **-5 Priority**, the user will almost always move last, ensuring they have taken damage before reflecting it. It is frequently compared to **Counter**; while Counter punishes Physical Wallbreakers, Mirror Coat punishes Special Sweepers. It is particularly effective on Pokémon with high HP but mediocre Special Defense, as taking more damage results in a more powerful reflection.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** a contact move. It is blocked by **Dark-type** Pokémon due to their immunity to Psychic-type moves. It cannot be intercepted or called by moves like *Assist* or *Metronome*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (64 learners), primarily found among bulky Water types and specialized defensive Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Wobbuffet** (where it is a core part of its Shadow Tag trapping set), **Suicune**, **Milotic**, and **Blastoise**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on offensive or high-utility Pokémon like **Nihilego**, **Miraidon**, and **Archaludon** as a "tech" choice to surprise and eliminate opposing Special Sweepers that expect a standard offensive trade.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is somewhat restricted; it is rarely a TM/TR and is most commonly learned via Level Up or as a specialized Egg Move for many starter Pokémon like **Swampert** and **Serperior**.
