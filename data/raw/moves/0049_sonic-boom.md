## Identity & Mechanics
**Sonic Boom** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user creates a destructive shockwave by compressing the air or vibrating its body at supersonic speeds. This wave of kinetic energy ripples through the battlefield, striking the opponent with a concussive blast that bypasses traditional defensive barriers and elemental resistances.
* **Effect:** This move deals a fixed amount of damage exactly equal to **20 HP**, regardless of the user's Special Attack or the target's Special Defense stats. It does not factor in type advantages or disadvantages, though it cannot hit Ghost-type Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Fixed 20], Accuracy 90%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Fixed-Damage Chip / Early-Game Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Sonic Boom is a staple of early-game progression and the **Little Cup (LC)** format. Because low-level Pokémon have small HP pools (often between 20-60 HP), dealing a guaranteed 20 damage is a massive "Nuke" that can 2HKO or 3HKO almost any unevolved threat. However, in high-level competitive play, its utility vanishes as 20 damage becomes negligible against Pokémon with 300+ HP. It is the lesser cousin to **Dragon Rage** (which deals 40 HP).
* **Type Matchups:** It ignores the type chart and deals neutral damage to all types except **Ghost**, which is immune to the move.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Reflect, Light Screen, and Stat Stages (Calculated after accuracy check).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (15 total learners), primarily concentrated among Electric-types and Pokémon capable of high-speed flight or vibration.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Magnemite/Magnezone**, **Voltorb/Electrode**, and **Yanmega**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Flygon** (via Vibrava) and the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna**, though it is rarely chosen for their final competitive movesets due to superior scaling options.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up; it is not currently available as a TM or TR in recent generations, making it a "legacy" tool for specific evolutionary lines.
