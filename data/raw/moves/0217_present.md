## Identity & Mechanics
**Present** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user hands the target a booby-trapped gift that may either explode with varying intensities or unexpectedly provide medicinal relief. This move represents a high-stakes gamble, visually depicted as the user tossing a wrapped package that bursts upon impact.
* **Effect:** The move selects one of four possible outcomes upon successful hit:
    * **40% Chance:** Inflicts damage with **40 Base Power**.
    * **30% Chance:** Inflicts damage with **80 Base Power**.
    * **10% Chance:** Inflicts damage with **120 Base Power**.
    * **20% Chance:** Heals the target for **25% of its maximum HP**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The healing effect is considered a primary outcome of the move).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Gimmick / High-Risk Gamble.
* **Usage:** Present is almost never used in serious competitive play due to its extreme inconsistency. The 20% chance to heal an opponent can accidentally negate a "Check" or provide a "Wall" with free recovery, turning the tide of the match against the user. It is vastly outclassed by reliable STAB options like **Body Slam** (for paralysis) or **Double-Edge** (for raw power).
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types and **No Damage** to Ghost types. It cannot hit any Pokémon for Super Effective damage.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a Physical move, it does not make direct contact in many generations, as the user "throws" the gift.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow and thematic distribution (18 total learners), primarily found on Pokémon associated with holidays, gift-giving, or "cute" archetypes.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Delibird**, and remains a staple in the movepool of its futuristic Paradox counterpart, **Iron Bundle**. It is also naturally learned or passed as an Egg Move to the **Blissey** and **Clefable** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Togedemaru** or **Pikachu** variants in casual play or "Metronome" style battles, but it offers zero tactical coverage advantage because it is a Normal-type move with a high risk of backfiring.
* **Acquisition:** Historically, it was rarely a TM; it is primarily obtained through level-up for Delibird or as a specific **Egg Move** for various "Fairy" and "Human-Like" egg group Pokémon.
