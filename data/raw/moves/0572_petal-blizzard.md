## Identity & Mechanics
**Petal Blizzard** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user conjures a localized tempest of razor-sharp flower petals, whipping them into a violent whirlwind that lashes out at everything in its vicinity. This botanical storm saturates the battlefield with floral debris, functioning as a high-velocity physical strike.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent physical damage to all adjacent Pokémon. Unlike its counterpart *Petal Dance*, this move does not lock the user into a multi-turn attack or cause confusion.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance of status or stat modification).
* **Targeting:** Attacks all other Pokémon (adjacent foes and allies in Double/Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Physical Spread Damage.
* **Usage:** It serves as a highly accurate Physical Grass-type option for Pokémon that lack access to *Leaf Blade* or want to avoid the accuracy risks of *Power Whip* (85% Acc). In VGC and Double Battles, it functions as a **Spread Move**, though it requires careful positioning or a "Telepathy" teammate since it also hits allies. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact (despite being physical); it is not blocked by *Rocky Helmet* or *Iron Barbs*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (38 learners), primarily centered around floral or forest-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by physical or mixed attackers such as **Meowscarada**, **Tsareena**, **Venusaur**, and the Mythical Pokémon **Zarude**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mew** or **Hisuian Lilligant** to provide a reliable Grass-type physical presence without the drawbacks of recoil or accuracy checks.
* **Acquisition:** While historically learned via level-up, it has become more accessible in recent generations (Gen IX) as a **TM**, allowing various Grass-type physical attackers to fill out their movesets.
