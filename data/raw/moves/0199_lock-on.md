## Identity & Mechanics
**Lock-On** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user focuses its senses or mechanical targeting systems on a specific foe, digitally or telepathically "painting" the target to ensure total accuracy. By calibrating its next strike, the user eliminates the variables of distance, speed, and evasive maneuvers, creating an inescapable line of fire for its subsequent offensive.
* **Effect:** Ensures that the user's next move against the target will bypass all accuracy and evasion checks, including those involving semi-invulnerable states (such as Dig, Fly, Dive, or Bounce). If the target uses Protect or Detect, Lock-On provides a slim mechanical chance to break through, though it is not guaranteed.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is uniquely able to make **One-Hit KO (OHKO)** moves like Sheer Cold or Guillotine guaranteed to hit, provided the user's level is equal to or higher than the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Setup Utility / Accuracy Enabler.
* **Usage:** Lock-On is almost exclusively used as a "Setup" move to facilitate high-power, low-accuracy "Nuke" moves. Its most famous pairing is with **Zap Cannon** (120 BP, 50% Accuracy, 100% Paralyze) or **Dynamic Punch**. In competitive Singles, it is often considered a "momentum sink" because it requires two turns to execute one attack, allowing the opponent to switch to a counter or use Taunt. It is more effective when used by bulky Pokémon that can survive a hit during the setup turn. This move can also be transferred to a teammate via **Baton Pass**.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage; however, it is frequently used to guarantee **Super Effective** hits from coverage moves against **Water, Flying, Steel, and Ice** types depending on the follow-up attack.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; passed by Baton Pass; targets Pokémon in semi-invulnerable states.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (24 learners), primarily limited to mechanical, artificial, or highly disciplined Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by the **Magnezone** line, the **Porygon** line, and the **Regi Trio** (Regirock, Regice, Registeel).
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on high-speed or tactical Pokémon like **Dragapult** and **Genesect**, though they often prefer immediate pressure over a two-turn Lock-On core.
* **Acquisition:** Generally acquired through level-up; it is not a common TM/TR in recent generations, making its presence on a team a predictable indicator of a low-accuracy "nuke" strategy.
