## Identity & Mechanics
**Coil** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The Pokémon winds its long, serpentine body into tight, concentric loops, centering its focus and priming its muscles. This maneuver allows the user to harden its physical form for protection while simultaneously sharpening its eyesight and striking power.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s **Attack**, **Defense**, and **Accuracy** stats by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to self-buff).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Multi-Stat Setup / Win Condition.
* **Usage:** Coil is an elite setup move that is strictly superior to *Bulk Up* and *Hone Claws* because it combines the benefits of both. The simultaneous boost to physical bulk and offensive pressure makes the user difficult to revenge kill with physical attackers. Crucially, the **Accuracy boost** allows the user to bypass the reliability issues of high-power, low-accuracy moves like Gunk Shot, Iron Tail, or Dragon Tail.
* **Synergy:** It deals **Super Effective** damage indirectly through STAB users against **Grass** and **Fairy** types, though its primary purpose is to enable "Perfect Accuracy" strategies.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by Taunt (in terms of being a status move, it is blocked by Taunt).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow, thematic distribution (25 learners), restricted almost exclusively to serpentine, eel-like, or elongated Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Zygarde** (all forms), **Serperior** (as an alternative to its Contrary/Special sets), and **Arbok**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Eelektross** and **Sandaconda** to turn them into formidable physical "bulky sweepers." **Milotic** occasionally runs it in niche physical or "sleeper" sets to leverage its natural bulk. 
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is primarily learned via Level Up and is not available as a TM or TR in most generations, making it a rare and prized part of a Pokémon's movepool.
