## Identity & Mechanics
**Yawn** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user lets out a massive, contagious yawn that inflicts intense drowsiness upon the target. This psychological and physiological pressure forces the opponent into a "sleepy" state, causing them to fall into a deep slumber at the end of the following turn. It is a premier tool for disrupting momentum and forcing tactical retreats.
* **Effect:** Targets the opponent and makes them "drowsy." At the end of the next turn, the drowsy Pokémon falls asleep. This effect is canceled if the target switches out before the end of the next turn. The move fails if the target already has a non-volatile status condition or is protected by Safeguard/Electric Terrain.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Status Move). However, it uniquely **ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers**, ensuring the "drowsy" status is applied regardless of the opponent's dodge investment.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Phazing Utility / Momentum Generator.
* **Usage:** Unlike *Spore* or *Sleep Powder*, Yawn does not provide immediate incapacitation. Instead, it creates a "forced choice" scenario: the opponent must either switch out to reset the timer (losing their turn/stat boosts) or stay in and allow their Pokémon to be neutralized by sleep. It is a staple on **Defensive Walls** and **Entry Hazard Stackers**, as it punishes switches with Stealth Rock or Spikes damage. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal direct damage. It is ineffective against Pokémon with the **Insomnia**, **Vital Spirit**, or **Purifying Salt** abilities.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; fails against targets behind a Substitute (in most generations) or those already afflicted by a status like Burn or Paralysis.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (95 learners), primarily found among heavy, sluggish, or aquatic Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with defensive stalwarts like **Hippowdon**, **Snorlax**, **Slowbro**, and **Dondozo**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by **Vaporeon** and **Quagsire/Clodsire** to stop setup sweepers in their tracks. In lower tiers, **Snorlax** uses it to force favorable matchups for its *Curse* sets.
* **Acquisition:** While often learned via level-up, it has historically appeared as a **TM** or **Egg Move** for various Starters (like **Swampert** and **Skeledirge**) and bulky Normal-types.
