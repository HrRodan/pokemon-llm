## Identity & Mechanics
**Hyper Drill** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user focuses its centrifugal force, spinning the pointed, drill-like appendages of its body at extreme velocities to pierce the opponent's defenses. This move is specifically designed to bypass evasive maneuvers, drilling through energy barriers and kinetic shields to strike the target directly.
* **Effect:** This move ignores and hits through protection moves, including **Protect, Detect, Spiky Shield, Baneful Bunker, Silk Trap, and King's Shield**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Stall Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Hyper Drill serves as a high-powered, high-consistency STAB move that punishes "Protect-spam" strategies common in VGC and defensive singles play. While it shares the 100/100 stat spread with moves like Earthquake, its **critically low PP** makes it susceptible to **Pressure** users and long stall wars. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, and cannot hit **Ghost** types without Scrappy or Ring Target.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (3 total learners), serving as the signature move of its evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Dunsparce** and its evolutions, **Dudunsparce (Two-Segment Form)** and **Dudunsparce (Three-Segment Form)**.
* **Evolutionary Significance:** Hyper Drill is the mechanical trigger for evolution; a Dunsparce must know this move and level up to evolve into Dudunsparce.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move with a very specific distribution, it is rarely seen as "coverage" on non-Normal types, but on Dudunsparce, it acts as a primary offensive tool to bypass the passive recovery and scouting provided by an opponent's Protect.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM or TR; it must be learned naturally through leveling up.
