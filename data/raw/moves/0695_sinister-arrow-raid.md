## Identity & Mechanics
**Sinister Arrow Raid** is a physical Ghost-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Harnessing the power of Decidium Z, the user (Decidueye) channels spectral energy to manifest a massive volley of shadowy quills. The Pokémon takes to the sky, raining down countless arrows upon the target before delivering a final, high-speed kinetic strike. This move is the upgraded version of Decidueye’s signature move, Spirit Shackle.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. As a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy and evasion checks, meaning it cannot miss unless the target is in the semi-invulnerable turn of a move like Dig or Fly.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (standard damage-dealing Z-Move).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 180, Accuracy —% (Never-miss), PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** High-Power Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** This move serves as a one-time "Delete Button" used to secure a OHKO on bulky neutral targets or to bypass defensive checks that rely on evasion or chip-damage stalling. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types. Compared to a standard Spirit Shackle, Sinister Arrow Raid provides a massive jump in damage output, allowing Decidueye to break through walls like Slowbro or Reuniclus more effectively.
* **Attributes:** Physical, Non-Contact (the user fires arrows rather than touching the foe directly), Signature Z-Move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a specialized Z-Move exclusive to one evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively used by **Decidueye** (and its Hisuian form in compatible Generation VII formats).
* **Coverage Utility:** Since it requires the specific **Decidium Z** Crystal and the move **Spirit Shackle**, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. It is the gold standard for Decidueye sets looking to maximize Ghost-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) burst damage.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible in Generation VII via the **Decidium Z**, which is given to the player by Professor Kukui or Hau depending on the version (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon). It is not available in generations where Z-Moves were removed (Gen VIII and beyond).
