## Identity & Mechanics
**Triple Kick** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rapid-fire sequence of three consecutive kicks, striking the target with increasing momentum. The move is characterized by its rhythmic martial arts execution, where each subsequent blow lands with significantly more force than the initial strike, making it a signature technique for technical fighters.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage three times in a single turn. The base power scales with each successful hit: the first hit has **10 Power**, the second has **20 Power**, and the third has **30 Power** (for a total potential base power of 60).
* **Secondary Effect:** Each hit undergoes a **separate accuracy check**. If any kick misses, the sequence ends immediately. This move is unique in that it can bypass **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, and break through **Substitutes** to damage the opponent behind them.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 10/20/30 (60 Total), Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Multi-Hit Utility / Sash Breaker.
* **Usage:** Triple Kick is a niche alternative to more consistent Fighting-type moves like *Low Kick* or *Brick Break*. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to punish "lead" Pokémon relying on Focus Sashes or the Sturdy ability. However, because each hit has an independent 90% accuracy check, the probability of landing all three hits is approximately **72.9%**, making it less reliable than *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Iron Barbs*, or *Rough Skin* three times if all hits connect.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (only 2 natural learners), making it one of the rarest Fighting-type moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Hitmontop**, reflecting its "top-like" spinning martial arts style. It is also learned by the Ultra Beast **Pheromosa**, which utilizes its high Speed and Attack to leverage the move's multi-hit properties.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme rarity, it is almost never seen as coverage on non-Fighting types. It is strictly a specialized STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for its few users.
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM or TR**; it is typically obtained only through leveling up or specific evolutionary methods (such as Tyrogue evolving into Hitmontop).
