## Identity & Mechanics
**Protect** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user creates an impenetrable defensive barrier around itself, completely foiling all incoming attacks for the duration of the turn. This move is a fundamental defensive maneuver used to scout opponent sets, stall for field conditions, or mitigate incoming damage.
* **Effect:** Prevents all effects of moves (including damage) from hitting the user for the remainder of the turn. If used consecutively with itself or other protection moves (Detect, Endure, Wide Guard, etc.), the success rate of Protect drops by 50% for each consecutive use.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, certain moves like **Feint**, **Shadow Force**, and **Phantom Force** can bypass and break the protection. Moves used by Pokémon with the **Unseen Fist** ability also bypass this move.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Scouting / Stalling.
* **Usage:** Protect is arguably the most important move in **VGC (Doubles)**, where it is used to stall out an opponent's **Tailwind** or **Trick Room**, protect a vulnerable Pokémon while a partner eliminates a threat, or scout for **Choice Item** locks. In Singles, it is frequently paired with **Leftovers**, **Toxic**, or **Leech Seed** to "Stall" for chip damage and recovery. It has high **Priority (+4)**, ensuring it almost always activates before the opponent attacks.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Status move; it does not check for type matchups but is susceptible to **Taunt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a near-universal distribution (1,246 learners), being available to almost every Pokémon that can learn TMs.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Incineroar:** A VGC staple that uses Protect to position itself for Intimidate cycles and Fake Out pressure.
    * **Gliscor:** Utilizes Protect to safely trigger **Poison Heal** and stall turns for massive recovery.
    * **Ferrothorn:** Uses it to rack up **Leech Seed** and **Iron Barbs** damage while recovering HP.
    * **Toxapex:** A premier defensive wall that uses Protect to scout for super-effective coverage moves.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not an offensive coverage move, it is "auto-include" utility for **Speed Boost** users like **Blaziken** or **Yanmega**, allowing them to safely gain a Speed stage on the first turn of combat.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (TM17 in many gens) or **TR** in every generation since its debut.
