## Identity & Mechanics
**Curse** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation II. Unlike almost any other move in the Pokémon franchise, its function fundamentally changes based on the typing of the user, making it a dual-purpose tool for setup or disruption.

* **Description:** The user invokes a dark, mystical hex. For Ghost-type Pokémon, the user sacrifices its own life force to bind an opponent in a lingering shadow that drains their health. For all other types, the user accepts a physical burden, moving more sluggishly but hardening its body and strengthening its strikes.
* **Effect:** 
    * **If the user is Ghost-type:** The user consumes 50% of its maximum HP to place a "Curse" on the target. The cursed target loses 25% of its maximum HP at the end of every turn. This effect persists even if the user switches out.
    * **If the user is NOT Ghost-type:** The user’s **Speed** is lowered by one stage, while its **Attack** and **Defense** are raised by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the Curse effect (Ghost-type version) can be passed via **Baton Pass**.
* **Targeting:** Specific Target (Ghost version) / User (Non-Ghost version).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Setup Sweeper / Wallbreaker Utility.**
* **Usage:** 
    * **Non-Ghost (The "CurseLax" Archetype):** This version acts as a specialized *Bulk Up*. It is ideal for bulky attackers who do not mind moving last or those that utilize **Trick Room** or the move **Gyro Ball** (which scales with lower speed). 
    * **Ghost (The Phazer/Timer):** Used to force out "Wall" Pokémon (like Blissey or Toxapex) or to punish setup sweepers. Since the 25% HP drain is fixed, it provides a rapid "clock" that forces the opponent to switch or faint.
* **Attributes:** This move cannot be copied by **Mirror Move**. It bypasses **Accuracy/Evasion** checks (it never misses).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an incredibly wide distribution with **473** potential learners, as it was a ubiquitous TM in Generation II and returned as a TM in Generation IX.

* **Prominent Users (Non-Ghost Setup):**
    * **Snorlax:** The definitive user; "CurseLax" uses its high Special Defense to survive while Curse patches its lower Defense and boosts its Attack.
    * **Dondozo:** A premier physical wall in modern competitive play that uses Curse to become an immovable object.
    * **Ferrothorn:** Frequently uses Curse to lower its Speed, which directly increases the power of its **Gyro Ball**.
* **Prominent Users (Ghost-type Variant):**
    * **Mimikyu:** Often uses the Ghost-type version as a last-ditch effort to take down a massive threat before fainting.
    * **Gengar:** Uses the sacrifice mechanic to prevent being "set up on" by opponents.
* **Acquisition:** Historically a TM in Johto (TM03) and recently returned as **TM077** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
