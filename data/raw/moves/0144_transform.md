## Identity & Mechanics
**Transform** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user undergoes a complete molecular restructuring to assume the exact likeness of the opponent. This mystical or biological mimicry allows the user to replicate the target's appearance, elemental typing, and physiological traits, effectively becoming a mirror image of the foe on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** The user copies the target’s species, weight, type, ability, and current stat stages. It also replicates the target's entire move set, though each copied move is limited to 5 PP. Notably, the user retains its original **HP stat**, which is often a significant drawback for users with low base HP like Ditto. The move bypasses accuracy checks but will fail against a substitute or another transformed Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses check), PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Strategic Imitator / Revenge Killer.**
* **Usage:** While manual use of Transform is rare due to the turn cost, it is the mechanical foundation for the ability **Imposter**. In competitive play, it is used to scout the opponent's moves, sets, and abilities. When paired with a **Choice Scarf**, a transformed Pokémon becomes the ultimate **Revenge Killer**, as it copies the opponent's boosted stats but outspeeds them due to the held item. It is particularly effective against "Set-up Sweepers," as the user can copy the opponent's stat boosts (like Dragon Dance or Quiver Dance) and turn their own power against them.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; cannot be copied by Mirror Move or forced by Encore.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (Only 2 natural learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Ditto**, whose entire competitive viability revolves around this move (specifically via the *Imposter* ability). It is also the signature thematic move of the Mythical Pokémon **Mew**, reflecting its lore as the ancestor of all Pokémon containing every piece of genetic data.
* **Coverage Utility:** Transform does not provide traditional coverage; instead, it provides **Dynamic Adaptability**. By transforming, the user gains the STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and coverage moves of whatever threat it is facing, allowing it to hit the opponent's team for **Super Effective** damage using their own teammates' movepools.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely rare; it has never been available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor instruction, remaining exclusive to its two thematic users.
