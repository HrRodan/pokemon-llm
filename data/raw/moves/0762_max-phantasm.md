## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Phantasm** is a Ghost-type Dynamax move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This move manifests as a massive eruption of spectral energy, ghostly apparitions, or a haunting vortex that overwhelms the opponent. As a Dynamax move, it represents the pinnacle of Ghost-type offensive pressure, shrouding the battlefield in a malevolent aura that weakens the physical resolve of its targets.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the power of the original base move. Crucially, it bypasses accuracy checks and penetrates protection moves (dealing 25% of the original damage through *Protect* or *Detect*).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target's **Defense** stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 90–150], Accuracy [--]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Offensive Support.** 
* **Usage:** Max Phantasm is a premier tool for **Physical Sweepers**. Because it guaranteed-lowers the opponent's Defense, each successive hit (or a teammate's follow-up attack) becomes significantly more lethal. It is often compared to *Max Darkness* (which lowers Special Defense), making Max Phantasm the preferred choice for physical attackers to "chip down" bulky walls that would otherwise stall them out. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Dynamax-exclusive; power scales with the base move (e.g., *Phantom Force* yields higher power than *Astonish*); ignores evasion and accuracy modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users

    * **Mimikyu:** Utilizes this move to capitalize on its *Disguise* free turn, setting up KOs by lowering the opponent's bulk.
    * **Aegislash:** Can utilize both physical and special versions to maintain offensive momentum during Dynamax turns.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ghost Pokémon such as **Cinderace** or **Tyranitar** (via *Shadow Ball* or *Shadow Claw*) to provide crucial coverage against Psychic-type walls like Slowbro or Cresselia.
* **Acquisition:** Exclusively available during the Dynamax phenomenon in Pokémon Sword & Shield.
