## Identity & Mechanics
**Silver Wind** is a Special Bug-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** The user creates a shimmering, gale-force wind infused with silver-colored scales or powdery dust from its wings. This iridescent gust not only strikes the opponent with abrasive force but also has the potential to leave a mystical residue that empowers the user.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage to a single target. It carries a 10% chance to trigger an "Omniboost," raising the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats by one stage each simultaneously.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to raise all of the user's stats by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Stat-Fishing Tech / High-Variance Special Offense.
* **Usage:** Silver Wind is primarily defined by its low PP and its game-changing secondary effect. In competitive play, it is often considered a "high-risk, high-reward" move. It is significantly weaker than **Bug Buzz** (90 BP), making it a less reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. However, players may run it on Pokémon with the **Serene Grace** ability (doubling the effect chance to 20%) to fish for a sweep-defining stat boost. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass**, **Psychic**, and **Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Classified as a **Wind-based move** in later generations, interacting with abilities like *Wind Power* or *Wind Rider*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily concentrated among winged Bug-types and mythical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by STAB users such as **Volcarona**, **Yanmega**, **Beautifly**, and **Butterfree**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on versatile Special attackers or Legendaries like **Mew**, **Celebi**, and **Arceus**, who may utilize it for its unique boosting potential. It is also a rare Bug-type coverage option for **Flygon**.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM62** during Generation IV (Sinnoh) but has become more restricted in later generations, often appearing as a level-up or egg move.
