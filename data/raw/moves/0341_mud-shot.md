## Identity & Mechanics
**Mud-Shot** is a Special Ground-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user hurls a concentrated blast of thick, sticky mud at the target. This viscous projectile deals direct damage while physically hampering the opponent's movement, making it harder for them to maneuver on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and reduces the target's Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s **Speed** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 55, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** Mud-Shot serves as the Ground-type equivalent to *Icy Wind* or *Bulldoze*. While its base power is too low for it to function as a primary "Wallbreaker" or "Nuke," its guaranteed Speed drop makes it an excellent **Utility** move. It is often used to punish aggressive switches or to allow a slower teammate to "out-speed" and "check" a faster threat. Compared to its rival **Earth Power**, Mud-Shot sacrifices raw damage for essential **Speed Control**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range projectile; not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (**276 total learners**), appearing frequently on Pokémon found in aquatic, marshy, or desert environments.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Swampert**, **Gastrodon**, **Garchomp**, and the Legendary **Groudon**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Ground types like **Greninja**, **Inteleon**, and **Cinderace** to provide niche coverage against Electric and Steel types while simultaneously providing speed tier manipulation. 
* **Acquisition:** It is highly accessible, featuring as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in recent titles like *Pokémon Sword & Shield* and *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.
