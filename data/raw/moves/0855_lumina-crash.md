## Identity & Mechanics
**Lumina Crash** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a blinding, iridescent burst of peculiar light that transcends physical impact to strike the target's psyche directly. This mental assault is so overwhelming that it destabilizes the opponent’s spiritual and mental fortitude, leaving them wide open to further special attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and guaranteed to lower the target's Special Defense stat by two stages (-2 Sp. Def).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to harshly lower Special Defense.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Progressive Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While its base power is slightly lower than *Psychic* (90), the guaranteed -2 Special Defense drop makes it one of the most oppressive offensive moves in the game. It effectively doubles the damage of the next hit, forcing the opponent to switch out or face an inevitable knockout. It is the primary tool used to break through bulky Special Walls like Blissey or Clodsire. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Does not trigger abilities like Static or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Espathra**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, on Espathra, it is often paired with the Ability **Speed Boost** and the move **Protect**, allowing the user to outspeed the entire meta while systematically dismantling the opponent's defensive stats.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned naturally by Espathra upon evolution or at a specific level.
