## Identity & Mechanics
**Silk Trap** is a Status Bug-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user weaves an intricate, sticky web of reinforced silk around its body to create a temporary defensive barrier. This silk-based shield not only negates incoming damage but entangles any opponent that attempts a physical strike, significantly hindering their mobility. This move is optimized for defensive playstyles and speed control.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all effects of moves (damage and status) directed at it during the turn it is used. If a move that makes **direct contact** is used against the user while Silk Trap is active, the attacker's **Speed stat is lowered by one stage**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the attacker's Speed upon contact.
* **Targeting:** User (Priority +4).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Defensive Utility / Speed Control.**
* **Usage:** Silk Trap is a "Protect-plus" move, similar to *Spiky Shield*, *Baneful Bunker*, or *Obstruct*. While it shares the same priority bracket and failure rate if used consecutively as *Protect*, its unique selling point is the guaranteed Speed drop. This allows a slower user to potentially outspeed a physical threat on the following turn or provide team support by slowing down a "sweeper." It is particularly effective against physical attackers who rely on contact moves like *Close Combat*, *U-turn*, or *Flare Blitz*. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage, but as a Bug-type move, it is blocked by the Ability **Good as Gold** if it were a targeted status move (though since it is a self-targeting protection move, it generally bypasses most immunity checks unless the opponent uses *Infiltrator* or *Feint*).
* **Attributes:** Priority +4; Protection-based; Contact-triggered penalty.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Silk Trap has an **extremely narrow** distribution, serving as a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, it is the signature move of **Spidops**, the Trap Pokémon. It defines Spidops' identity as a tactical hazard-setter and defensive pivot.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on non-Bug types or even other Bug types at this time. It is used to punish faster physical attackers who might otherwise try to OHKO the user.
* **Acquisition:** It is learned via Leveling Up by its specific user; it is **not available** as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor lesson in Generation IX.
