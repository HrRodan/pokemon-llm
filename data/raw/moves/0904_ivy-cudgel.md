## Identity & Mechanics
**Ivy Cudgel** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask DLC)**.
* **Description:** The user swings a heavy, ivy-wrapped club or baton with immense force. This signature move is deeply tied to the user's held item; the cudgel’s elemental properties and visual appearance (glowing vines, burning embers, flowing water, or jagged stone) shift instantly to match the wearer's mask. It is designed to find openings in a foe's defense, represented by its high precision and lethality.
* **Effect:** This move possesses a **High Critical Hit Ratio** (+1 stage, meaning a 12.5% chance to crit without other modifiers). Crucially, its **Type is adaptive**: while naturally Grass-type, it becomes **Fire-type** if the user holds the Hearthflame Mask, **Water-type** if holding the Wellspring Mask, and **Rock-type** if holding the Cornerstone Mask.
* **Secondary Effect:** Increased Critical Hit Ratio.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / High-Consistency STAB.** 
* **Usage:** Ivy Cudgel is widely considered one of the most efficient Physical moves in the game. It outclasses standard options like *Leaf Blade* due to higher Base Power and lacks the drawback of *Wood Hammer’s* recoil. In its alternate forms, it provides Ogerpon with 100-power Physical STAB for Fire, Water, or Rock—types that often struggle with accuracy (e.g., Stone Edge) or power/drawback trade-offs (e.g., Flare Blitz).
* **Matchups:** 
    * **Grass Form:** Hits **Water, Ground, and Rock** for Super Effective damage.
    * **Fire Form:** Hits **Steel, Bug, Ice, and Grass**.
    * **Water Form:** Hits **Fire, Ground, and Rock**.
    * **Rock Form:** Hits **Flying, Fire, Ice, and Bug**.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin. It is **not** a punching or slicing move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution, restricted exclusively to the legendary Pokémon Ogerpon and its various forms (4 learners total).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Ogerpon (Hearthflame Mask):** Uses the Fire-type version to act as a premier **Physical Wallbreaker** and Sun-team sweeper.
    * **Ogerpon (Wellspring Mask):** Utilizes the Water-type version to check Ground and Fire types while maintaining high bulk.
    * **Ogerpon (Teal Mask):** The pure Grass-type variant, often utilized with a Choice Band or Life Orb for maximum neutral damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move changes type based on the mask, it defines Ogerpon's role in the meta. It allows Ogerpon to bypass traditional counters; for example, Hearthflame Ogerpon uses the Fire-type Ivy Cudgel to incinerate the **Steel-types** (like Corviknight) that usually wall Grass-types.
* **Acquisition:** This is a **Signature Move** and cannot be taught via TM/TR or learned by any other Pokémon.
