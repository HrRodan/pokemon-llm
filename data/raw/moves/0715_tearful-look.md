## Identity & Mechanics
**Tearful Look** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user manipulates the opponent's emotions by welling up with tears, appearing vulnerable to dampen the target's "combative spirit." This psychological tactic effectively suppresses the opponent's offensive capabilities. As a non-damaging Normal-type status move, it focuses on disruption and survival rather than direct confrontation.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack and Special Attack stats by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the debuff (unless blocked by abilities like Clear Body or items like Clear AMulet).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Always Hits/Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Offensive Debuffer.
* **Usage:** Tearful Look is a niche utility move used to cripple **Mixed Attackers** or force switches. It is functionally identical to the move *Noble Roar*. By lowering both offensive stats, it effectively increases the bulk of the user or its teammates, making it harder for the opponent to land a knockout. While often outclassed by more specialized moves like *Will-O-Wisp* (which provides permanent chip damage and a harsher Attack drop), Tearful Look is superior against special attackers or targets with *Guts*. It does not deal damage, so it does not trigger type-based effectiveness, but it is ineffective against Pokémon behind a **Substitute** or those with **Magic Bounce**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; blocked by *Protect* and *Detect*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (18 total learners), primarily found among Pokémon themed around emotions, tears, or deceptive appearances.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably associated with **Inteleon** (and its pre-evolutions Sobble/Drizzile), **Toxtricity** (both Low Key and Amped forms), and **Goodra** (including its **Hisuian Form**).
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on defensive or support-oriented Pokémon like **Wishiwashi** or **Sudowoodo** to mitigate their weaknesses to powerful wallbreakers. In lower competitive tiers, it can be used by **Plusle** or **Minun** to facilitate a teammate's safe switch-in.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via Level-up; it is not available as a TM or TR in current generations, making its distribution very specific to its flavor-themed learners.
