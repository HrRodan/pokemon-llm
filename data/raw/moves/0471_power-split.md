## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Split** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user weaves a psychic link between itself and the target, forcibly redistributing offensive energy to achieve a state of equilibrium. Visually, it manifests as a shimmering psychic aura that draws power from the stronger combatant to bolster the weaker one. This move is a premier tool for "Stat Neutering," allowing Pokémon with naturally abysmal offenses to cripple high-powered sweepers while simultaneously increasing their own threat level.
* **Effect:** The move adds the user’s current unmodified Attack stat to the target’s unmodified Attack stat and divides by two, setting both Pokémon's Attack to that average. It repeats this exact process for the Special Attack stat. This calculation ignores stat stage modifiers (like Swords Dance) but permanently alters the raw stats for the duration the Pokémon remains in battle.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility / Debuff / Stat Manipulation.
* **Usage:** Power Split is a niche tactical move primarily used by defensive "walls" that possess extremely low offensive stats. By averaging their own near-zero Attack/Special Attack with a high-octane "Wallbreaker," the user effectively cuts the opponent's offensive presence in half. Unlike moves like Growl or Charm, Power Split cannot be easily ignored by switching if the user has already gained the permanent stat boost. It is particularly effective in **Doubles/VGC** to "neuter" a powerhouse opponent or even "buff" a weak ally.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; affects both Physical and Special offenses simultaneously.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (26 total learners), primarily found among defensive Psychic, Ghost, and Rock types.
* **Prominent Users:** The most iconic user is **Shuckle**, which utilizes its base 10 Attack/Special Attack to effectively halve the offenses of almost any opponent. Other notable users include **Claydol**, **Cofagrigus**, and **Runerigus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Legendary or high-tier Pokémon like **Hoopa (Unbound)** and **Nihilego**, though they usually prefer direct attacking sets. In lower tiers, **Beheeyem** or **Indeeedee-M** may use it to disrupt specialized attackers.
* **Acquisition:** It is generally learned via Level-up or Egg Move. It is notably **not a TM/TR** in most generations, making its presence on a team a deliberate and often surprising teambuilding choice.
