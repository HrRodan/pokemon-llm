## Identity & Mechanics
**Grudge** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user harbors a deep-seated resentment and prepares a final, spiteful curse directed at its attacker. If the user is struck down and faints before its next action, it releases its lingering malice to completely drain the spiritual energy of the move that finished it, rendering that move unusable for the remainder of the battle unless restored by items.
* **Effect:** Sets a "Grudge" state on the user. If the user faints due to direct damage from an opponent's move while this state is active, the PP of the move used by the opponent is reduced to 0. 
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Guaranteed PP drain upon fainting). Note: Does not trigger if the user faints from indirect damage (e.g., Burn, Poison, Sandstorm, or Life Orb recoil).
* **Targeting:** User (Sets a conditional effect on the user's field slot).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Sacrifice Utility / Strategic Disruption.
* **Usage:** Grudge is a niche "Spite-on-steroids" move used primarily as a last-resort sacrifice. It is most effective when the user anticipates being KOed by a high-value, low-PP move (such as **Hydro Pump**, **Draco Meteor**, or a **Choice-locked** move). By deleting the PP of a primary offensive tool, the user can effectively "neuter" a threat even after fainting. It is often compared to **Destiny Bond**; while Destiny Bond removes the Pokémon entirely, Grudge is used when the goal is to specifically disable a move that a teammate cannot otherwise wall.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move targeting the user, it bypasses type immunities (can affect Normal types). It is strategically used to protect teammates weak to specific **Ghost** or **Dark** type coverage.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails if the user does not faint before its next turn.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (23 learners), concentrated primarily among spectral and cursed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Ghost types such as **Banette (and Mega Banette)**, **Mismagius**, and **Spiritomb** frequently have access to this move via level-up. **Shedinja** is a unique user, as its 1-HP nature makes Grudge technically easy to trigger, though it usually prefers offensive pressure.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Ninetales (and Alolan Ninetales)** or **Galarian Cursola**, who use it as a thematic utility move to punish attackers.
* **Acquisition:** Grudge is rarely available via TM or TR, typically requiring Level Up or specific Egg Move breeding chains to obtain.
