## Identity & Mechanics
**Swift** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user radiates a burst of golden, star-shaped rays from its body that home in on targets with supernatural precision. Because the rays track the target's energy, the attack is guaranteed to land regardless of environmental conditions or the opponent's attempts to hide. 
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move is unique because it **bypasses all accuracy and evasion modifiers**, meaning it will not miss even if the user is blinded (e.g., Sand-Attack) or the target has increased its evasion (e.g., Double Team/Minimize).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Guaranteed Hit).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (hits both foes in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy —% (Infinite), PP 20.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Reliable Finisher.
* **Usage:** Swift is rarely used as a primary offensive tool due to its low base power. However, it serves as a hard counter to "Evasion Cheese" strategies and can be used to chip down opponents who are near faint to ensure they don't escape via luck. In Double Battles, it acts as a low-power **Spread Move**. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is **ineffective** against **Ghost** types and resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Bypasses Protect/Detect only if used by a Pokémon with the No Guard ability (otherwise blocked).

* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on a vast array of non-Normal Pokémon such as **Starmie**, **Lucario**, and **Greninja**. It is often utilized in early-game progression or as a "Never-Miss" insurance policy in niche formats.
* **Acquisition:** Swift is a staple of the TM (Technical Machine) system, appearing as a teachable move in nearly every generation, including the original Kanto games, the Galar region (TM40), and the Paldea region (TM032).
