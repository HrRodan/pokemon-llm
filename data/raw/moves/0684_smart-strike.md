## Identity & Mechanics
**Smart Strike** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user focuses its concentration and stabs the opponent with a sharp horn, blade, or hardened appendage. This precision-based attack is executed with such tactical accuracy that it is guaranteed to land regardless of environmental conditions or the target's agility.
* **Effect:** This move ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring a guaranteed hit.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy --%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Evasion Counter.
* **Usage:** Smart Strike serves as a reliable Steel-type physical attack for Pokémon that do not have access to the more powerful **Iron Head** or **Heavy Slam**. While its base power is modest, its "never-miss" mechanic makes it a hard counter to "Minimize" or "Double Team" strategies and ensures it is not hindered by accuracy-dropping moves like Mud-Slap or abilities like Sand Veil. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs. It is frequently categorized as a "horn" or "blade" move thematically.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (68 learners), primarily given to Pokémon with horns, spikes, or blade-like anatomy.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Kartana**, which utilizes its massive Attack stat to turn this move into a lethal Fairy-slayer, as well as **Excadrill**, **Aggron**, and **Celesteela**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a vital coverage option on non-Steel Pokémon like **Tapu Bulu**, **Terrakion**, and **Nidoking** to punish incoming Fairy-type switch-ins that would otherwise resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** (TM67 in Gen 7, TR79 in Gen 8, TM053 in Gen 9), making it a flexible technical choice for physical attackers needing a reliable way to hit Fairy-type threats.
