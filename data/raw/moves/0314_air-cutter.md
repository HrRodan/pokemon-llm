## Identity & Mechanics
**Air Cutter** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** The user launches razor-sharp gusts of pressurized wind that hack at the target like blades. This move creates vacuum-like slicers that are difficult to evade and specifically designed to strike vital points.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and possesses an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage, meaning a 12.5% chance to crit under normal conditions).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The high critical-hit ratio is a built-in mechanic rather than a percentage-based secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** All opponents (Spread move; hits both foes in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 95%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Spread Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** In Single Battles, Air Cutter is generally outclassed by **Air Slash** due to its higher base power (75) and flinch chance. However, in Double Battles, it serves as a niche **Spread Move** for Special Attackers that lack access to Tailwind or Heat Wave. Its primary value lies in its high critical hit rate, which allows it to bypass defensive stat boosts (like Calm Mind) more frequently. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** a contact move. It is categorized as a "slicing" move in later generations (benefiting from abilities like Sharpness) and is treated as a "wind" move in Generation IX, interacting with the Wind Power and Wind Rider abilities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (134 learners), primarily consisting of Pokémon with wings, blades, or the ability to manipulate air.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently used by **Pidgeot**, **Charizard**, **Crobat**, and **Togekiss** during the leveling process or in early-tier competitive formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-traditional Flying-type Special attackers like **Flygon**, **Salamence**, and **Noivern** as a reliable way to hit multiple targets in VGC or doubles formats.
* **Acquisition:** It has appeared frequently as a Move Tutor move in older generations and returned as a **TM** in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.
