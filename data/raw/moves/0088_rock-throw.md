## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Throw** is a physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user picks up and hurls a large, heavy boulder or a shower of jagged stones at the target to inflict damage. This move represents a primitive form of Rock-type offense, relying on the user's raw physical strength to launch projectiles.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Early-Game STAB / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Rock Throw is almost entirely obsolete. It is strictly outclassed by **Rock Slide** (which offers more power and a flinch chance) and **Stone Edge** (which offers a massive power boost and high critical-hit ratio). Its 90% accuracy is also a notable drawback for such low damage output. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Considered a projectile move (interacts with the Bulletproof ability).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Rock- and Ground-type Pokémon (64 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to early-game Rock-types like **Geodude**, **Onix**, and **Rhyhorn**. It is also frequently learned by modern physical attackers such as **Lycanroc** and **Garganacl** during their early level-up stages.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Fighting-types like **Conkeldurr** or Ground-types like **Landorus-Therian** at very low levels, though these Pokémon quickly replace it with more reliable coverage options like Stone Edge.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. Unlike many other Rock-type moves, it is rarely featured as a **TM or TR**, making its availability limited to the natural movepools of mountainous or cavern-dwelling Pokémon.
