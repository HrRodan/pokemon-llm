## Identity & Mechanics
**Ice Ball** is a physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user creates and hurls a small ball of ice at the target. With each successful hit, the user gathers frost and momentum, causing the projectile to grow in size and destructive force. This "snowball effect" results in a multi-turn assault where the impact becomes increasingly heavy and freezing.
* **Effect:** The user is locked into using Ice Ball for up to five consecutive turns. The base power doubles with each successful hit (30, 60, 120, 240, 480). The sequence ends prematurely if the move misses, the target is immune, or the user is flinched/recalled. Notably, if the user has used **Defense Curl** previously while on the field, the base power of Ice Ball is doubled for the entire duration of the sequence (starting at 60).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power-doubling mechanic is a primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30 (Initial), Accuracy 90%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Snowballing Sweeper / Gimmick Setup.
* **Usage:** Ice Ball is the Ice-type variant of the move *Rollout*. It is rarely seen in high-level competitive play due to its "High-Risk" nature; the 90% accuracy creates a high probability of the chain breaking before reaching maximum power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types. It is best used against defensive walls that lack the power to KO the user before the power reaches the 120+ BP threshold.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact** and is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, naturally learned by only 15 Pokémon species.
* **Prominent Users:** It is most iconically associated with the **Walrein** and **Glalie** evolutionary lines, which can utilize their natural bulk to survive the early turns of the lock-in. **Alolan Sandslash** is a notable physical attacker that gains STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) on the move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Hisuian Electrode** or **Hisuian Qwilfish**, providing these unconventional types with physical Ice coverage to hit Ground or Flying threats that usually check them.
* **Acquisition:** Ice Ball is primarily learned through leveling up; it is not available as a TM or TR in recent generations, making it a relatively rare specialized tool.
