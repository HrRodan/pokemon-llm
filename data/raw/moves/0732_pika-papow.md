## Identity & Mechanics
**Pika Papow** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically as an exclusive mechanic for the Let’s Go series.
* **Description:** The user, a Partner Pikachu, channels the deep emotional bond with its Trainer to unleash a concentrated burst of electrical energy. This move is fueled by the power of friendship; as the Pikachu’s affection for its Trainer increases, the intensity and voltage of the discharge grow exponentially. Because it is a manifestation of a spiritual bond, the attack strikes with unerring precision, surrounding the target in a flash of unavoidable lightning.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the Pokémon’s friendship/happiness level. The power scales according to the formula: `Friendship / 2.5`. At maximum happiness (255), the move reaches its peak output.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it possesses the **unavoidable** attribute, bypassing all accuracy and evasion checks.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 1–102], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Perfect Accuracy Nuke.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!*, this serves as the definitive Electric-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. It outclasses the standard **Thunderbolt** (90 Power) once friendship is maximized, offering a higher damage ceiling of 102 Power combined with the utility of never missing. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Partner Power** move. It does not make contact and is unaffected by most traditional protection modifiers that target standard moves, though it can still be blocked by Protect or Detect.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a signature "Partner Move" (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the **Partner Pikachu** given to the player at the start of *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!*. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. It is designed to ensure the player's starter remains viable against high-evasion threats or late-game bosses.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not learned via level-up, TM, or TR. It is taught specifically by the **Move Tutor** located in the Pokémon Centers of Cerulean City, Celadon City, and Fuchsia City in the Kanto (Let's Go) region.
