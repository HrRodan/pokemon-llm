## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Steelspike** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This move is a powerful Galar-region technique exclusively available to Pokémon that have undergone **Dynamaxing** or **Gigantamaxing**. When executed, the user summons massive, jagged metallic pillars or spikes that erupt from beneath the target, impaling them with refined steel. This move is designed to reinforce the user's team, coating them in a protective metallic sheen.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the power of the user's original physical Steel-type move. Upon hit, it **raises the Defense stat of the user and its allies** by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to provide a +1 Defense boost to the user’s side of the field.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Targeted).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 90–150], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Setup Sweep / Physical Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** As a Max Move, it bypasses accuracy checks (even hitting through Fly or Dig). It is a premier **Consistency Option** in the VGC (Doubles) and Gen 8 Singles meta-games. Unlike Max Starfall or Max Lightning which set terrain, Max Steelspike provides a **Stat-Boosting** effect that "snowballs," making the user increasingly difficult to revenge-kill with physical attackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Power is determined by the base move (e.g., Iron Head results in 130 Power, while Heavy Slam results in 150 Power).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal distribution** among any Pokémon that knows a Physical Steel-type move while Dynamaxed.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Corviknight:** Uses Max Steelspike to become an unbreakable physical wall while dealing heavy damage.
    * **Excadrill:** Frequently uses this move to boost its physical longevity while cleaning through Fairy-type threats like Clefable.
    * **Copperajah:** Utilizing its high Attack and Heavy Slam base, it reaches the maximum 150 Power threshold.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Steel Pokémon like **Tyranitar** or **Gyarados** (via Iron Head or Iron Tail) to surprise and counter **Fairy-type** checks like Zacian-C or Togekiss.
* **Acquisition:** Not learned naturally; it is an **active transformation** of existing moves (such as Iron Head, Smart Strike, or Steel Roller) while the user is in a Dynamaxed state.
