## Identity & Mechanics
**Trick Room** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user exerts its psychic power to warp the local dimensions, creating a "bizarre area" that persists for five turns. Within this field, the fundamental laws of speed are inverted, allowing slower Pokémon to act before their faster counterparts. This reality-warping effect is a cornerstone of strategic speed control.
* **Effect:** For five turns (including the turn of use), Pokémon with lower Speed stats move first within their priority bracket. This move has a **priority of -7**, ensuring the user almost always moves last on the turn it is cast. If Trick Room is used while already active, the effect is terminated immediately.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, certain items (Full Incense, Lagging Tail, Quick Claw) and the Ability **Stall** allow a Pokémon to ignore the inverted speed order.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Team Archetype Enabler / Speed Control.**
* **Usage:** Trick Room is the namesake of an entire competitive archetype ("TR Teams"). It is used to transform naturally slow, bulky "Wallbreakers" into terrifying "Sweepers" by allowing them to strike first. Unlike **Tailwind**, which buffs the user's side, Trick Room changes the field state, making it a powerful counter to "Hyper Offense" teams that rely on high Base Speed. It does **not** affect move priority; a move like *Extreme Speed* or *Protect* will still go before a standard move regardless of the room's effect.
* **Attributes:** Field Effect, Negative Priority.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (185 learners), primarily found among Psychic, Ghost, and Fairy types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic setters include **Cresselia** and **Porygon2** (valued for their immense bulk to ensure setup), and **Hatterene**, who uses the *Magic Bounce* ability to prevent the move from being disrupted by *Taunt*. 
* **Competitive Staples:** **Bronzong** and **Stakataka** are premier "OTR" (Offensive Trick Room) users that benefit from their own setup. **Mimikyu** is a frequent user in Singles because its *Disguise* ability almost guarantees a successful turn to activate the move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally carried by faster Pokémon like **Gengar** or **Meowscarada** as a "Reverse Trick Room" tech to shut down opposing TR strategies by casting it while the field is already active.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM or TR** (Technical Record) in almost every generation since its debut, making it highly accessible for most Specially-oriented or Psychic-type Pokémon.
