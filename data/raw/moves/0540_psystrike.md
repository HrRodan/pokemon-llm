## Identity & Mechanics
**Psystrike** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user materializes a solidified, odd psychic wave and hurls it at the target. Unlike typical psychic projections, this wave manifests with physical force, crashing into the opponent to deal impact-based damage. This unique property allows a Special attacker to exploit physical vulnerabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage using the user's Special Attack stat, but calculates damage against the target's **Defense** stat rather than its Special Defense. It functions as a superior version of the move Psyshock.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Power Reliable STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Psystrike is the definitive "Special Wallbreaker" move. It allows a Special Attacker to bypass traditional Special tanks like **Blissey** or **Chansey**, who boast massive Special Defense but low physical Defense. Compared to *Psychic* (90 BP), Psystrike offers more raw power and better utility. Compared to *Psyshock* (80 BP), Psystrike is strictly superior in damage output while maintaining the same defensive-targeting mechanic. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite dealing physical damage, it is **not** a contact move and is not affected by King's Rock or Iron Barbs. It is boosted by items like Life Orb and Twisted Spoon.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (3 learners), functioning as a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Mewtwo**, including its powerful Mega Evolutions, **Mega Mewtwo X** and **Mega Mewtwo Y**. It is the primary reason Mewtwo remains a top-tier threat in Uber tiers, as it prevents Special walls from safely switching in.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not found as coverage on non-Psychic types. However, on **Mega Mewtwo X**, it provides a powerful Special option that complements its massive Physical Attack, making it a "mixed" nightmare to wall.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned by Mewtwo upon reaching high levels (typically Level 100 in earlier gens, lower in recent ones).
