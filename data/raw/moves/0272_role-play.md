## Identity & Mechanics
**Role-Play** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its psychic energy to mirror the opponent's physiological or spiritual essence, effectively mimicking their innate traits. This allows the user to psychically overwrite its own biological characteristics with those of the target, adopting their special ability for the duration of the encounter.
* **Effect:** The user’s ability is replaced with the target’s current ability. This effect lasts until the user is switched out or the battle ends. The move is highly reliable as it ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers to ensure the "mimicry" connects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it fails if the target possesses specific unique or restrictive abilities, including **Wonder Guard**, **Illusion**, **Imposter**, **Multitype**, **Stance Change**, **Trace**, **Flower Gift**, **Forecast**, or **Zen Mode**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Strategic Utility / Ability Counter.
* **Usage:** While niche in Single battles, Role-Play is a potent **Counter-Counter** tool in Doubles or VGC formats. It is primarily used to "steal" beneficial abilities from teammates or opponents, such as **Intimidate**, **Huge Power**, or weather-setting abilities like **Drizzle**. Unlike *Skill Swap*, which exchanges abilities, Role-Play allows the user to gain a powerful ability without giving the opponent the user's own (potentially detrimental) ability. It is often used to bypass the limitations of a Pokémon's natural ability to turn them into a more threatening **Wallbreaker** or **Pivot**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; cannot be copied by Mirror Move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (163 learners), primarily found among Psychic-types and Pokémon with high dexterity or "mimicry" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Alakazam**, **Mew**, **Mr. Mime**, and **Deoxys**. These Pokémon often use their high Speed tiers to secure an ability change before the opponent can react.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on versatile attackers like **Greninja**, **Infernape**, and **Lucario**. In specific competitive gimmicks, Pokémon like **Medicham** or **Bisharp** may carry it to adapt to the opponent's defensive utility.
* **Acquisition:** It has been available as a **Move Tutor** move in several generations (such as Emerald, Platinum, and Ultra Sun/Moon) rather than a standard TM, making its availability shift significantly between regional formats.
