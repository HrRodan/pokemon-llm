## Identity & Mechanics
**Blazing Torque** is a physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user vents its internal combustion engine, releasing a concentrated blast of searing exhaust and superheated flames at the target. This move is characterized by its association with the Starmobiles of Team Star, representing the raw thermal power of a high-performance racing engine converted for combat.
* **Effect:** Deals direct physical damage. While the base data lacks a standard description, in-game mechanics grant it a high probability of igniting the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Burn-Inducing Physical STAB** / Boss Signature Move.
* **Usage:** Blazing Torque functions as a superior alternative to *Fire Punch* (75 Power / 10% Burn) and a safer, more utility-focused alternative to *Flare Blitz* (120 Power / Recoil). The 30% burn rate makes it a physical equivalent to *Scald*, allowing the user to cripple physical attackers while dealing consistent damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** designed for the "Boss" encounters in the Paldea region.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the **Schedar Starmobile (Revavroom)**, piloted by Mela of Team Star’s Fire Crew.
* **Coverage Utility:** Under standard play, no Pokémon can learn this move via leveling, TM, or Breeding. It is hard-coded as an NPC-only move for the Starmobile custom vehicles.
* **Acquisition:** **Unobtainable** by players through legal gameplay. It does not exist as a TM or TR, making it one of the rare "unobtainable" moves that can only be seen in specific story-driven boss battles.
