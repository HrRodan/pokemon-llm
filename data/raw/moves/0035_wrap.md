## Identity & Mechanics
**Wrap** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user releases a constricting burst of physical pressure, coiling its body, tentacles, or long appendages around the target to squeeze them relentlessly. This binding maneuver prevents the target from retreating while inflicting consistent crushing damage over several turns, making it a staple for serpentine or multi-limbed Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts initial damage and traps the target for 2–5 turns. While trapped, the target cannot switch out or flee and takes residual damage equal to 1/16 of its maximum HP at the end of each turn. The effect ends prematurely if the user leaves the field or if the target uses **Rapid Spin** or **Shed Shell**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to induce the **Partial Trapping** status condition upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15, Accuracy 90%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Partial Trapping Utility** / **Passive Damage.**
* **Usage:** While its base power is negligible, Wrap is used primarily for its **Trapping** mechanic. In early generations (specifically Gen 1), Wrap was a notorious "lock" move that prevented opponents from moving entirely. In modern competitive play, it is a niche utility move used to prevent "Passive Walls" from switching out, allowing the user to whittle them down with chip damage or set up. It is generally considered inferior to trapping moves like *Magma Storm* or *Spirit Shackle* due to its low power and Normal typing. It deals **neutral** damage to most types but is completely negated by **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move; it triggers abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (43 learners), primarily focused on serpentine, elastic, or multi-appendage Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Dragonite** (the infamous "Agili-Wrap" set in Gen 1), **Arbok**, and **Serperior**. It is also a core thematic move for **Tentacruel** and **Milotic**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Ultra Beasts like **Nihilego** or **Xurkitree** as a flavor-based trapping option, and on Ground-types like **Sandaconda** to capitalize on its coiling theme.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via **Level Up**. It was available as **TM15** in Generation I but has largely disappeared from the TM/TR lists in modern titles, making it rarer in current movepools.
