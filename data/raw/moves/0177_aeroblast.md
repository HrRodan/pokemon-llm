## Identity & Mechanics
**Aeroblast** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** As the signature move of the legendary Lugia, Aeroblast involves the user gathering a massive vortex of wind and launching a high-pressure, focused blast of air at the target. This cyclone-like projectile is designed to pierce defenses and destabilize the opponent through sheer atmospheric force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and possesses an increased critical hit ratio (+1 stage, meaning it has a 12.5% chance to crit normally, or higher if combined with items like Scope Lens).
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Direct damage with high crit rate).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Impact Signature STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Aeroblast is considered one of the premier Flying-type moves in the series, offering a superior balance of power and accuracy compared to moves like *Hurricane* (70% Accuracy) or *Air Slash* (75 Power). The high critical hit ratio allows the user to occasionally bypass the opponent's defensive stat boosts (like Calm Mind or Iron Defense), making it a potent tool against defensive cores. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, wind-based projectile. It is not affected by King's Rock or similar items beyond its innate crit chance.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the exclusive signature move of the Johto Mascot.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Lugia**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is rarely seen outside of Lugia. However, in competitive formats like "Anything Goes" or "Smogon Uber," it can be theoretically utilized by **Smeargle** via the move Sketch.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be obtained by Lugia through leveling up or being caught with the move in various legendary encounters across the generations.
