## Identity & Mechanics
**Nature Power** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user draws upon the latent energy of the surrounding environment to manifest a powerful attack. The specific move executed is determined entirely by the battlefield's current terrain or geographic location, ranging from elemental blasts to seismic shifts.
* **Effect:** This move transforms into a different attack based on the environment. In modern competitive play, it is primarily defined by its interaction with **Terrains**:
    * **Electric Terrain:** Becomes *Thunderbolt*.
    * **Grassy Terrain:** Becomes *Energy Ball*.
    * **Misty Terrain:** Becomes *Moonblast*.
    * **Psychic Terrain:** Becomes *Psychic*.
    * In standard environments (link battles without terrain), it defaults to **Tri Attack**.
* **Secondary Effect:** Depends on the resulting move (e.g., 10% chance to Paralyze with Thunderbolt, 10% chance to drop Special Defense with Energy Ball).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (mirrors the targeting of the resulting move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies], Accuracy [Varies]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Adaptable Offensive Utility / Priority Nuke.
* **Usage:** Nature Power is a unique "calling" move. Because it is technically categorized as a **Status Move**, it receives **+1 Priority** from the ability **Prankster**. This allows a Pokémon to fire off high-damage attacks like *Moonblast* or *Thunderbolt* before the opponent can move. It is often paired with a "Seed" item or a Terrain-setting teammate to ensure the desired move type.
* **Type Matchups:** Depending on the terrain, it can deal **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Flying, Dragon, Fighting, Poison,** and **Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many restrictions; for example, if the user is holding an **Assault Vest**, they cannot select Nature Power, but if they are under the effect of **Taunt**, they cannot use it (as it is technically a Status move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (153 learners), primarily focused on Grass, Rock, and Legendary Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Whimsicott** (for Prankster-priority attacks), **Ludicolo**, and the **Tapu Guardians** (Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini), who automatically set the terrain required to optimize the move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon like **Heatran** or **Xerneas** to capitalize on specific terrain-boosted coverage in VGC or high-tier Smogon formats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM96** in Generations VI and VII, making it a staple coverage option for many competitive teams during those eras.
