## Identity & Mechanics
**King's Shield** is a **Status Steel-type** move introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user assumes a majestic, impenetrable defensive stance, manifesting a spectral or physical shield to intercept incoming strikes. This move is the signature technique of the Aegislash line, serving as the mechanical trigger to shift from the offensive Blade Forme back into the durable Shield Forme. It is a high-priority maneuver designed to punish over-eager physical attackers.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all damage for the duration of the turn. If a move that makes **direct contact** hits the user while King's Shield is active, the attacker’s **Attack stat is harshly lowered (by 2 stages)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reduce the attacker's Attack by two stages upon contact. (Note: Since Gen VIII, the reduction was changed from two stages to one stage in official games, but based on the provided data, it functions as a -2 stage drop).
* **Targeting:** Affects the **User** (Priority +4).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Defensive Pivot / Forme Manipulator.**
* **Usage:** King's Shield is the cornerstone of Aegislash's "Stance Change" playstyle. It allows the Pokémon to strike in its high-offense Blade Forme and immediately revert to its high-defense Shield Forme to tank the next hit. Unlike *Protect*, it provides a massive debuff to physical attackers, effectively "crippling" physical wallbreakers like **Mega Kangaskhan** or **Garchomp**. However, its primary weakness is that it **does not block status moves** (e.g., Will-O-Wisp, Taunt, or Toxic), making the user vulnerable to utility-based shutdown.
* **Attributes:** **Priority Move (+4)**. It fails if used consecutively, similar to *Protect* or *Detect*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the signature move of a specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Aegislash (Shield Forme)** and **Aegislash (Blade Forme)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move linked to the **Stance Change** ability, it is never seen on non-Steel types. Its presence on the field forces opponents into a "mind game" (50/50) where they must decide whether to attack and risk the Attack drop or use a Status move to bypass the shield.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via level-up or Move Reminder for the Aegislash line. It is not available as a TM, TR, or HM.
