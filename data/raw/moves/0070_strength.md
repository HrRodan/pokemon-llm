## Identity & Mechanics
**Strength** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user summons its internal physical brawn to deliver a powerful, heavy-handed strike against the target. While primarily known as a utility Hidden Machine (HM) used to move massive boulders in the overworld, in battle, it manifests as a reliable, high-impact physical assault.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Strength serves as a middle-of-the-road Physical STAB move. In competitive environments where **Return** (102 Power) or **Body Slam** (30% Paralysis chance) are available, Strength is typically outclassed. However, in formats where those moves are restricted, or during "In-Game" playthroughs, it acts as a dependable move with no accuracy drawbacks. It deals **neutral damage** to almost all types but is ineffective against **Ghost** types and resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (406 total learners), as it was historically a required HM for game progression.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by high-Attack heavyweights such as **Snorlax**, **Machamp**, **Slaking**, and **Aggron**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on a vast array of Pokémon across all types—including Starters like **Charizard**, **Feraligatr**, and **Rillaboom**—often serving as a filler physical move during the main story of various Pokémon titles.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **HM04** in Generations I through VI, and as a **TM** in later iterations like Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl.
