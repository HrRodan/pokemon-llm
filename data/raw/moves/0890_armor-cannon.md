## Identity & Mechanics
**Armor Cannon** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user transmutes its own protective spiritual armor into high-velocity, blazing projectiles, launching them at the opponent with explosive force. By physically discarding its defensive plating to fuel the attack, the user increases its offensive output at the cost of its physical and special durability. This move is characterized by intense heat and kinetic impact.
* **Effect:** Deals massive damage but lowers the user’s Defense and Special Defense stats by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (The stat reduction is a primary mechanic/cost of the move).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Armor Cannon is the Fire-type equivalent of *Close Combat*, but geared for Special Attackers. It provides a more reliable alternative to *Fire Blast* (due to 100% accuracy) and is often preferred over *Overheat* in sustained battles because it preserves the user's Special Attack stat, allowing for consecutive hits. However, the defensive drops make the user significantly more susceptible to being revenge-killed by priority moves or faster physical attackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Grass, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** **Ballistics/Bullet Move** (This move is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Armarouge**. As Armarouge's signature move, it defines its role as a powerful mid-speed wallbreaker, especially when paired with items like **Choice Specs** or **Life Orb**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently unavailable to non-Fire types. In competitive doubles (VGC), it is a staple on **Trick Room** teams where Armarouge can fire off high-powered shots before the opponent can exploit its lowered defenses.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned by Armarouge upon evolving from Charcadet (using the Auspicious Armor) or via Level Up.
