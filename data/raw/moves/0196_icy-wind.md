## Identity & Mechanics
**Icy Wind** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user creates a gust of freezing cold air that engulfs the battlefield. This sudden drop in temperature numbs the targets' joints and slows their reflexes, making it an essential tool for tactical positioning.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and is guaranteed to lower the target's Speed stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Speed.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move). In Double Battles, it hits both foes, applying the Speed drop to both simultaneously.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 55, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Speed Control / Utility Chip.
* **Usage:** While its raw power is low compared to *Ice Beam* or *Blizzard*, Icy Wind is a cornerstone of the **VGC (Doubles)** metagame. Its primary purpose is "Speed Control," allowing a trainer to manipulate the turn order so that their slower, more powerful attackers can move before the opponent's threats. It is often preferred over *Electroweb* because the Ice type provides excellent offensive coverage against common **Dragon, Flying, Grass,** and **Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses *Substitute* if used by a Pokémon with the *Infiltrator* ability; subject to spread damage reduction in Double Battles (dealing 75% damage to each target).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (370 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely utilized by bulky supports like **Cresselia** and **Suicune** to disrupt the opponent's tempo, and high-speed threats like **Iron Bundle** and **Flutter Mane** to ensure they maintain the speed advantage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ice Pokémon such as **Gengar**, **Kyogre**, and **Blastoise** to provide vital speed control and chip damage against Dragon-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** It has been a consistent staple as a **TM** or **Move Tutor** move across almost every generation, particularly appearing as TM143 in Generation IX.
