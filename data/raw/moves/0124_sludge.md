## Identity & Mechanics
**Sludge** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user hurls a glob of unsanitary, toxic muck at the target to inflict damage. This discharge of liquid filth represents concentrated pollution, coating the opponent in hazardous waste that can seep into their system.
* **Effect:** Deals direct damage and has a high probability of inducing the Poison status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** **30% chance** to Poison the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Mid-Tier Reliability / Consistency STAB.
* **Usage:** Sludge serves as a reliable early-to-mid-game STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. In competitive settings, it is almost strictly outclassed by **Sludge Bomb**, which boasts higher Power (90) and the same Poison chance. However, its 30% status rate is significantly higher than most "standard" attacks (like Flamethrower's 10%), making it a decent tool for spreading status in lower-tier formats or during a main-story playthrough. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; unaffected by Iron Barbs or Rocky Helmet. It is not a pulse, ball, or bomb move, meaning it bypasses certain niche defenses like Bulletproof (unlike its successor, Sludge Bomb).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (16 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon themed around pollution, waste, or swamps.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconically utilized by the **Muk** and **Weezing** lines (including Alolan and Galarian variants) as their signature progression STAB. It is also a staple for **Garbodor**, the personification of landfill waste.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically learned by the **Swampert** line and **Swalot**, providing these bulky attackers with a way to threaten Grass-type checks that would otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. Unlike many other Poison-type moves, it lacks wide availability as a TM/TR in modern generations, making its distribution much more exclusive than its "Bomb" counterpart.
