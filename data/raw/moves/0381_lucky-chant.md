## Identity & Mechanics
**Lucky Chant** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user chants a mystical, protective incantation toward the sky, enveloping its side of the field in a divine aura. This rhythmic prayer harmonizes the air, calming the tides of battle to ensure that the user and its allies are shielded from the unpredictable lethality of a foe's strikes.
* **Effect:** For five turns, Pokémon on the user’s side of the field are immune to receiving critical hits. This effect persists even if the user switches out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User's Field (Affects the entire team in Singles, Doubles, and Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Setup Protection.
* **Usage:** Lucky Chant is a niche support move designed to eliminate the "RNG factor" of critical hits. In competitive play, it is primarily used to protect "Calm Mind" or "Iron Defense" setup sweepers, as critical hits famously bypass defensive stat boosts. While reliable for its specific purpose, it is often outclassed by **Reflect**, **Light Screen**, or **Aurora Veil**, which provide consistent damage reduction rather than situational protection against 1/24 (or higher) odds.
* **Attributes:** This move is a field effect; it does not make contact and is not affected by Protect or Magic Coat. It specifically counters abilities like **Super Luck** and moves with high critical-hit ratios like **Stone Edge** or **Leaf Blade**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (42 learners), primarily found among mystical, fairy-like, or celestial Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with "Mythical" or "Fairy" archetypes such as **Jirachi**, **Clefairy**, **Magearna**, and **Shaymin**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on support-oriented Pokémon like **Audino**, **Comfey**, and **Blissful** healers like **Togepi** to ensure team longevity during long stall wars. It is also learned by the **Delphox** line, fitting their "mage/spellcaster" theme.
* **Acquisition:** Lucky Chant is generally learned through leveling up; it is notably absent from TM and TR lists in most generations, making its presence in a moveset a deliberate choice for specialized team compositions.
