## Identity & Mechanics
**Bubble-Beam** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user forcefully ejects a high-pressure stream of iridescent, soapy bubbles at the target. This barrage of orbs strikes with enough concussive force to not only deal damage but also leave a slick residue or cause disorientation, potentially hindering the target's mobility.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a secondary chance to impede the opponent's movement.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to lower the target’s **Speed** stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Mid-tier Progression STAB / Utility Tech.
* **Usage:** In modern competitive play, Bubble-Beam is largely considered a "transition move." It is significantly outclassed by **Surf** (90 Power) for raw damage and **Scald** (80 Power) for the superior 30% Burn chance. However, in "Little Cup" (LC) formats or during main-story playthroughs, it serves as a reliable accuracy-perfect option before more powerful TMs are acquired. The Speed drop, while infrequent, can occasionally shift a Speed tier matchup in the user's favor.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. In Generation I, it was one of the most widely distributed Water-type TMs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (107 learners), being a staple for most Water-type Pokémon's natural leveling pool.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Water-type starters utilize this during their mid-evolution stages, most notably **Blastoise**, **Empoleon**, and **Primarina**. It is also a signature part of the early-game kit for **Starmie** and **Vaporeon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically, it was frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Nidoking**, **Nidoqueen**, and **Dragonite** in early generations to provide crucial coverage against Rock and Ground-type walls.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM11** in the Kanto region (Generation I), it has since transitioned to being primarily learned through level-up or as an Egg Move in later titles.
