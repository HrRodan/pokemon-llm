## Identity & Mechanics
**Mystical Fire** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user exhales a stream of ethereal, white-hot magical flames infused with mystical energy. Unlike standard combustion, these flames target the opponent's concentration and spiritual focus, surrounding them in an aura that dampens their ability to channel special energy. This makes it a premier choice for disrupting Special Attackers while dealing consistent damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and carries a guaranteed secondary effect.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s Special Attack stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Special Utility / Anti-Lead Coverage.
* **Usage:** While it has lower raw power than *Flamethrower* (90) or *Fire Blast* (110), Mystical Fire is preferred on defensive or utility-oriented sets. It acts as a "soft check" to Special Sweepers, effectively neutering their damage output while dealing chip damage. It is an essential tool for Fairy and Psychic types to hit Steel-type switch-ins like **Corviknight** or **Ferrothorn**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Steel, Grass, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move. It is often boosted by the ability *Blaze* (for Delphox) or weather conditions like **Sun (Drought)**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among mystical, feminine, or occult-themed Pokémon (61 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Originally the signature move of **Delphox**, it is now commonly utilized by high-tier threats like **Flutter Mane**, **Gardevoir**, and **Hatterene**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon, particularly Fairy-types like **Sylveon** and **Clefable**, to counter Steel-type threats that would otherwise wall their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves. Legendaries like **Eternatus** and **Latias** often carry it to win "mirror matches" by lowering the opponent's Special Attack.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM92** in Pokémon Sword and Shield, significantly expanding its presence in the competitive VGC and Smogon metas.
