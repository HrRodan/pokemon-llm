## Identity & Mechanics
**Discharge** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user releases a high-voltage flare of electricity from its body, creating an omnidirectional burst of current that arcs toward every Pokémon on the field. This electromagnetic eruption saturates the area, making it highly effective at disrupting nervous systems and machinery alike.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to induce the **Paralysis** status condition on each target hit.
* **Targeting:** All Other Pokémon (Hits allies and opponents in Doubles/Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Utility Spread.**
* **Usage:** In Singles, it is often preferred over *Thunderbolt* on defensive or bulky pivots who value the high **30% Paralysis rate** (the "Gold Standard" for secondary status effects) over raw power. In Doubles, it serves as a powerful spread move, though it requires a teammate with the *Telepathy* ability, the *Ground* type, or the *Volt Absorb/Lightning Rod* ability to avoid friendly fire. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. Bypasses *Substitute* if used by a Pokémon with the *Infiltrator* ability (though not inherently a sound-based move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (105 learners), appearing primarily on Pokémon with high electrical output or metallic compositions.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Zapdos**, **Magnezone**, **Rotom-Wash**, and **Raikou**. It is also a signature tool for high-tier threats like **Miraidon** and **Raging Bolt**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-pure Electric Pokémon like **Iron Moth** and **Stunfisk** to provide essential coverage against Flying-type switch-ins or to fish for Paralysis against faster threats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** (such as TM147 in Generation IX) and as a staple level-up move for most Electric-type families.
