## Identity & Mechanics
**Fiery Wrath** is a Special Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** The user transmutes its concentrated malice and indignation into a sinister, roiling aura resembling purple flames. This manifestation of pure rage erupts to engulf the battlefield, striking with a malevolent force that can shatter an opponent's resolve.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage to all adjacent opponents. In Double Battles, this move functions as a powerful spread attack.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20% chance** to cause the target(s) to **Flinch**, preventing their action for the turn if the user moves first.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Spread Attacker.
* **Usage:** Fiery Wrath is the signature move of **Galarian Moltres**. It is effectively a strictly superior version of *Dark Pulse* for this Pokémon, offering the same power and accuracy but adding spread damage capabilities without the damage reduction typical of most multi-target moves (it maintains high pressure in VGC). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** a contact move. Despite the "Fiery" in its name and visual description, it is **not a Fire-type move** and does not benefit from Sun or interact with most fire-related abilities (like Flash Fire), though it is resisted by Dark, Fairy, and Fighting types.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, being a unique Signature Move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Galarian Moltres**. The move synergizes perfectly with Moltres's **Berserk** ability; as Moltres takes hits and boosts its Special Attack, Fiery Wrath becomes a devastating tool for sweeping.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not used for coverage by other species. However, on Galarian Moltres, it provides essential STAB that punishes common metagame threats like Dragapult, Metagross, and Calyrex-Shadow.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned by Galarian Moltres upon leveling up or via the Move Reminder.
