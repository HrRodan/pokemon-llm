## Identity & Mechanics
**Take Heart** is a status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically within *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental fortitude and emotional strength to undergo a spiritual purification. This internal resolve allows the Pokémon to instantly purge itself of debilitating ailments while simultaneously bolstering its combat capabilities. This move is a powerful setup tool that combines the effects of status recovery with stat amplification, making the user a resilient threat on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** The user cures its own status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, or Freeze) and raises its Special Attack and Special Defense stats by one stage each. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% effect rate upon successful use).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (Status), Accuracy —% (Never Misses), PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Status Sponge.
* **Usage:** Take Heart acts as a specialized upgrade to **Calm Mind**. While Calm Mind provides the same +1 Special Attack and Special Defense boosts, Take Heart adds the critical utility of **Refresh**. This allows bulky setup sweepers to ignore "Status-based checks" such as *Toxic* or *Will-O-Wisp* from defensive walls like Blissey or Toxapex. By curing its own status while boosting, the user can effectively out-scale the opponent without fear of being crippled by residual damage or speed drops.
* **Attributes:** This is a Psychic-type status move; it does not deal direct damage and therefore does not interact with Type Matchup weaknesses, though it is blocked by the ability **Taunt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution, limited exclusively to the "Sea Guardian" family (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Manaphy:** The primary beneficiary. In competitive formats where it is permitted, Manaphy uses Take Heart to become an unkillable bulky sweeper, often pairing it with *Scald* or *Surf* to break through teams while ignoring status pressure.
    * **Phione:** While generally outclassed by its parent, Take Heart provides Phione with its most distinct niche, allowing it to function as a budget bulky booster in lower tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is restricted to Mythical Pokémon, it is not seen as coverage on other types. It is used strictly to facilitate a "win condition" for the user.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM/TR or Move Tutor for the general population; it is part of the specific level-up or move-relearner pool for Manaphy and Phione.
