## Identity & Mechanics
**Quash** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user exerts a suppressive force over the target, mentally or physically overwhelming them to disrupt their timing. This tactical maneuver forces the target to the very end of the turn's action queue, regardless of their Speed stat or the priority of the move they selected. It is a specialized form of speed control designed to seize initiative in fast-paced encounters.
* **Effect:** Forces the target to act last this turn. If the target has already acted or if the move is used in a Single Battle (where the user has already spent their turn to move), the move will typically fail or have no meaningful impact.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Speed Control / Disruptive Utility.
* **Usage:** Quash is almost exclusively a **Doubles/VGC** tool. In Singles, the move is effectively useless because using your turn to make the opponent go last results in no net advantage. In Doubles, however, it is a high-level tactical nuke; a fast Quash user (especially one with the **Prankster** ability) can target a fast, frail enemy "sweeper," forcing them to move last so that a slower, powerful ally can secure a KO before the enemy can even attack. It is the primary rival to *After You*, though it functions by hindering enemies rather than buffing allies.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dark-type status move, it is blocked by targets with the **Good as Gold** ability. Crucially, since Gen VII, Dark-type Pokémon are immune to status moves used by Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability, making Quash-users like Sableye wary of targeting opposing Dark-types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Protect" if the user has specific items or abilities, but generally checked by standard defensive plays. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (46 learners), primarily found among Dark-types, "royal" themed Pokémon, and manipulative tricksters.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Sableye** and **Murkrow** (both of whom leverage the **Prankster** ability to give Quash +1 priority), and **Incineroar**, who uses it as a disruption tool in VGC formats. **Oranguru** also utilizes it to manage turn order for its Trick Room strategies.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mew** or **Iron Leaves** in specialized VGC compositions to provide unexpected utility support against "Tailwind" or "Sand Rush" teams that rely on raw Speed.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM60** (Gen V-VI) and **TM06** (Gen VII). It has become more restricted in recent generations, often tied to specific move pools rather than universal TM availability.
