## Identity & Mechanics
**Sappy Seed** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go* series.
* **Description:** The user summons and grows a massive, rapidly developing botanical stalk that bursts to scatter parasitic seeds across the battlefield. These seeds attach to the target, siphoning their life force to provide sustained healing to the user. This move combines high-impact floral combat with persistent nutrient drainage.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and automatically plants a seed on the target, functioning identically to the move **Leech Seed**. The target loses 1/8 of its maximum HP at the end of every turn, which is then restored to the user.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to inflict the Leech Seed status condition upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Offensive Utility / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Sappy Seed is an elite-tier move due to its incredible compression of roles—providing high-base-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage while simultaneously forcing passive chip damage and recovery. It is strictly superior to moves like *Seed Bomb* or *Horn Leech* in terms of raw utility. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact physical attack, meaning it does not trigger abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*. It is blocked by the ability *Sap Sipper* and has no effect on Grass-type Pokémon (which are immune to Leech Seed mechanics).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a "Partner Move" exclusive to the special starter mechanics of the Kanto region in Generation VII (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Partner Eevee** (the player's starter in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*). 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Partner Eevee has access to various "Partner Moves" of different types, Sappy Seed serves as its primary tool for countering heavy **Rock and Ground-type** walls like Rhydon or Golem, while providing Eevee with much-needed longevity through the drain effect.
* **Acquisition:** Available only via a specialized Move Tutor located in Pokémon Centers (specifically in Celadon City) within the *Let's Go* titles. It is not available via TM, TR, or Breeding in any other mainline generation.
