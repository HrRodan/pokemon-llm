## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Gem** is a Special Rock-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal mineral energy to discharge a brilliant, crystalline ray of light that sparkles as if refracted through gemstones. Unlike the majority of Rock-type maneuvers that rely on hurling physical debris or boulders, Power Gem is a pure energy-based attack, making it one of the rare Special-category Rock moves that utilize beams and light-based projectiles.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage with no additional secondary effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** 0% (None).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Power Gem is prized for its perfect accuracy, a rarity among Rock-type moves which are notorious for low accuracy (e.g., Stone Edge, Rock Slide). It serves as the primary Special STAB option for Rock-type special attackers. While it lacks the raw power of *Meteor Beam* or the stat-boosting potential of *Ancient Power*, its reliability makes it a staple in competitive formats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. This move does not trigger abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (105 learners), appearing on various crystalline, mineral, or light-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized as a primary STAB move by **Nihilego**, **Glimmora**, **Diancie**, and **Flutter Mane**. It is also a signature Special option for **Ampharos** (especially in its Mega form).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon such as **Starmie**, **Gholdengo**, and **Espeon** to provide crucial coverage against Fire and Flying-type switch-ins like Volcarona or Charizard.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible as a **TM (TM101 in Gen IX)**, allowing a vast array of Special Attackers to adopt it for type coverage.
