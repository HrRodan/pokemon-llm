## Identity & Mechanics
**Sunny Day** is a Status Fire-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user intensifies the sun's rays, creating a Harsh Sunlight weather condition that persists for five turns. This environmental shift bathes the battlefield in light, empowering thermal attacks, accelerating plant growth, and evaporating water-based maneuvers.
* **Effect:** Changes the weather to Harsh Sunlight for 5 turns (extended to 8 turns if the user holds a **Heat Rock**). While active:
    * **Fire-type moves** deal 50% more damage.
    * **Water-type moves** deal 50% less damage.
    * **Solar Beam** and **Solar Blade** skip their charging turn.
    * **Healing moves** (Synthesis, Morning Sun, Moonlight) recover 2/3 of max HP instead of 1/2.
    * **Thunder** and **Hurricane** have their accuracy reduced to 50%.
    * Pokémon cannot be **Frozen**.
* **Secondary Effect:** Triggers specific abilities including **Chlorophyll** (doubles Speed), **Solar Power** (boosts Sp. Atk by 50% at the cost of HP), **Protosynthesis** (boosts highest stat), and **Leaf Guard** (prevents status conditions).
* **Targeting:** Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Weather Setter / Field Utility.
* **Usage:** Sunny Day is the cornerstone of "Sun Teams." While often automatically triggered by the ability **Drought**, the manual move is used by utility leads or "Prankster" Pokémon to override opposing weather (Rain, Sand, or Snow). It serves as a massive force multiplier for Fire-type **Nukes** and provides essential **Speed Control** for Grass-type sweepers.
* **Context:** It is the direct rival to **Rain Dance**. While Rain favors defensive bulk and 100% accuracy Thunders, Sunny Day focuses on overwhelming raw power and speed.
* **Attributes:** Weather-changing move. Bypasses accuracy and checks.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (833 learners), being one of the most widely available TMs in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard**, **Venusaur**, **Torkoal**, and **Ninetales**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Prankster users like **Whimsicott** or **Sableye** to provide priority weather setup. It is also a staple on Paradox Pokémon like **Flutter Mane** or **Great Tusk** to manually trigger their **Protosynthesis** boost in the absence of Koraidon.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in almost every generation since its debut.
