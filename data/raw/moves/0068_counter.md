## Identity & Mechanics
**Counter** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user anticipates a physical strike, absorbing the impact before retaliating with an explosive, amplified blow. This reactive technique focuses the kinetic energy of the opponent's own attack to deliver a crushing counter-offensive. It is a staple of martial arts-themed combat, emphasizing patience and timing over raw aggression.
* **Effect:** Deals fixed damage equal to exactly twice the HP lost from the last physical move that hit the user during the same turn. This move has a **Priority of -5**, meaning it will almost always execute last in a turn. It fails if the user was not hit by a physical move or if the move dealt no damage (e.g., hitting a Substitute).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Targets the specific Pokémon that last hit the user with a physical attack.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reactive Nuke / Revenge Killer.
* **Usage:** Counter is a high-risk, high-reward **Punishment Tool** primarily used by Pokémon with high HP pools or those equipped with a **Focus Sash**. It is the physical counterpart to *Mirror Coat*. While it is a Fighting-type move, it ignores standard type effectiveness multipliers (it does not deal 2x damage to Steels or 0.5x to Poisons); however, **Ghost-types are immune** to Counter as it is a Fighting-type move. It is an excellent way to "trade" a weakened Pokémon for a healthy physical **Wallbreaker**.
* **Attributes:** Negative Priority (-5). Does not make contact (though the move that triggered it likely did).

## Distribution & Notable Users
Counter has an extremely wide distribution with 257 potential learners, appearing frequently as an Egg Move or through Move Tutors.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Wobbuffet:** The defining user of the move, utilizing its massive HP and *Shadow Tag* ability to trap and eliminate physical attackers.
    * **Lucario:** Often runs a "Sash-Counter" set to lure in and OHKO faster physical threats like Garchomp or Landorus-T.
    * **Annihilape:** Leverages its bulk and Fighting STAB identity to punish physical pivots.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Chansey**, **Blissey**, and **Snorlax**. These high-HP Normal-types use Counter to surprise physical attackers who expect them to be passive walls. **Cinderace** also uses it effectively to leverage its high speed and the threat of *Libero* to force predictable physical responses.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM18** in Generation I; it has since transitioned to a common Egg Move and Move Tutor option across most modern titles.
