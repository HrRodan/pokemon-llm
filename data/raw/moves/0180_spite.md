## Identity & Mechanics
**Spite** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user unleashes its bottled-up resentment and ghostly malice toward the target, cursing their last-used action. This supernatural pressure causes the opponent to lose focus and stamina, significantly draining the remaining energy (PP) of the technique they just performed.
* **Effect:** Lowers the PP of the target’s last-used move by **4 points**. The move will fail if the target has not used a move since entering the field, if the move failed that turn, or if the target's last move already has 0 PP remaining.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% success rate under correct conditions).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **PP Stall** / **Utility**.
* **Usage:** Spite is a niche but potent tool in "stall" or "semi-stall" compositions. It is primarily used to deplete the PP of powerful, low-use moves like *Hydro Pump*, *Close Combat*, or *Recovery* moves (Soft-Boiled, Recover). By forcing a move to run out of PP faster than usual, the user can effectively "neuter" a threat or force a switch. It is particularly effective when paired with the **Pressure** ability, which doubles PP consumption.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it bypasses traditional type immunities (e.g., it can affect Normal-types despite being a Ghost-type move).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses *Protect* and *Detect* in certain generations (Gen 2-4), but generally interacts with standard accuracy checks. It is not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (231 learners), appearing frequently on Ghost, Dark, and Poison-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Gengar**, **Giratina** (both forms), and **Umbreon**, who use it to facilitate long-term survival and stalling.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on defensive stalwarts like **Toxapex** and **Sableye** (who can use it with the *Prankster* ability for priority PP draining) to counter setup sweepers or walls that rely on limited recovery moves.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available via **TM/TR** in various generations, most recently appearing as a craftable TM in **Pokémon Scarlet & Violet**.
