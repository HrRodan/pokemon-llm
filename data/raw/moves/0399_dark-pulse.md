## Identity & Mechanics
**Dark Pulse** is a Special Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user manifests a wave of malevolent energy, radiating a sinister aura born from concentrated negative thoughts. This pulse of darkness ripples outward to strike the foe, potentially overwhelming their resolve and causing them to hesitate in terror.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20%** chance to make the target **flinch**, preventing their action for that turn if the user moves first.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Dark Pulse is the definitive Special Dark-type move, serving as the special-attacking counterpart to *Crunch*. While moves like *Night Daze* offer higher power, Dark Pulse is preferred for its perfect accuracy and flinch chance. It is particularly lethal on fast attackers who can fish for flinches to "hax" through checks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Pulse-based move (boosted by the **Mega Launcher** ability). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (**241** total learners), making it one of the most accessible special coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on STAB users such as **Darkrai**, **Hydreigon**, **Greninja**, and **Yveltal**. It is also a staple for **Meowscarada** and **Chi-Yu**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently carried by non-Dark Pokémon like **Gengar**, **Lucario**, and **Mewtwo** to hit rival Ghost and Psychic types. **Mega Blastoise** specifically utilizes it to take advantage of the Mega Launcher boost.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible; it has appeared as a **TM** (TM79, TM97) or **TR** (TR58) in almost every generation since its debut.
