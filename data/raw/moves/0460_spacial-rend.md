## Identity & Mechanics
**Spacial Rend** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user focuses its cosmic power to literally tear the fabric of the universe around the target, distorting reality to inflict massive damage. This spatial distortion is so violent and precise that it frequently bypasses the target's standard defenses by striking vital points.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with an increased critical-hit ratio.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **high critical-hit ratio** (+1 stage), meaning it has a 12.5% chance (in modern gens) to deal 1.5x damage and ignore the user's negative stat stages and the target's positive defensive stages.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Power Signature STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Spacial Rend is the signature move of Palkia. In competitive play (Ubers), it is prized for being a "reliable nuke." Unlike *Draco Meteor*, it does not force a Special Attack drop, and unlike *Dragon Pulse*, it has significantly higher damage output. The 5% chance to miss is a minor risk compared to its high crit-rate, which allows it to occasionally punch through defensive boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is not blocked by most specialized protection abilities (like Bulletproof) but is subject to standard Dragon-type immunities (Fairy).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (2 total learners), as it is a Legendary signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Palkia** and **Palkia-Origin**. These Pokémon rely on Spacial Rend as their primary Dragon-type STAB to pressure other legendary Dragons like Giratina or Rayquaza.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is almost never seen on non-Dragon Pokémon, though it can technically be used by **Smeargle** via Sketch in formats where Smeargle is permitted.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is tied strictly to the Palkia evolutionary line, though certain event Pokémon (like the Movie 10 Darkrai or Arceus) have historically been distributed with the move.
