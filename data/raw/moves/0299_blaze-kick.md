## Identity & Mechanics
**Blaze Kick** is a physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn) as the signature move of Blaziken.
* **Description:** The user launches a fierce, flaming kick at the target that glows with intense thermal energy. This move is executed with a focus on precision and impact, tearing through the air with a trail of embers to strike weak points. Because of its explosive physical force, it is more likely to land a critical hit than standard attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage. This move has an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage, meaning a 12.5% chance to crit normally).
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single-target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Crit Physical STAB / Mid-Tier Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Blaze Kick serves as a middle-ground option for physical Fire-type attackers. While **Flare Blitz** offers more raw power (120 BP), it causes heavy recoil; Blaze Kick provides decent power without self-damage. It is often preferred over **Fire Punch** (75 BP) for the higher damage ceiling and critical-hit potential, which allows the user to bypass an opponent's defensive stat boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, primarily limited to martial arts-themed Pokémon or those with powerful leg-based attacks (19 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Originally the signature move of **Blaziken**, it remains a staple for the Hoenn starter. It is also a core move for **Cinderace**, **Hitmonlee**, and **Lucario**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Fire types as a coverage option to hit Steel and Ice types. Notable examples include **Galarian Zapdos**, **Genesect**, and **Zeraora**, who use it to threaten targets that would otherwise wall their primary STAB types.
* **Acquisition:** While historically rare, it became more accessible in Generation VIII as a **TR (Technical Record 88)** in Sword & Shield.
