## Identity & Mechanics
**Acid Armor** is a **Status Poison-type** move introduced in **Generation I** (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user chemically alters its cellular structure, liquefying its body or creating a viscous, reactive coating to shrug off physical impacts. By changing its physical state into a more fluid or hardened form, the user dramatically increases its durability against direct attacks.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user’s **Defense stat by two stages (+2)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the **User** only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Defensive Setup** / **Wall-Building**.
* **Usage:** Acid Armor is the Poison-type equivalent to *Iron Defense*. It is used primarily by defensive "stalling" Pokémon or bulky setup sweepers to become virtually impenetrable to physical attackers. In competitive play, it is often paired with recovery moves (like Recover or Strength Sap) or moves that utilize the Defense stat (like Body Press, though Acid Armor users rarely have access to it compared to Iron Defense users).
* **Context:** While functionally identical to *Iron Defense*, its distribution is flavored toward "liquid" or "amorphous" Pokémon (slimes, jellies, and soft-bodied organisms).
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the user.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **moderate** distribution (**38** total learners), primarily concentrated among Poison-types, Amorphous Egg Group members, and "liquid-based" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Vaporeon**, which uses it to bolster its lower physical defense, **Tentacruel**, and **Muk**. 
* **Competitive Staples:** In modern formats, **Hisuian Goodra** and **Melmetal** (via its pre-evolution Meltan's lineage) are notable for their ability to stack massive physical bulk. **Glimmora** and **Reuniclus** also utilize it to become difficult to remove from the field.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it doesn't provide offensive coverage, it is a key survival tool for non-Poison types like **Alcremie** and **Jellicent** to check physical wallbreakers.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. Unlike its counterpart Iron Defense, it is **not widely available as a TM/TR** in most generations, making its distribution more exclusive to specific biological archetypes.
