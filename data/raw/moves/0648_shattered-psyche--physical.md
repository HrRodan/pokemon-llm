## Identity & Mechanics
**Shattered Psyche (Physical)** is a Physical Psychic-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user harnesses the concentrated Z-Power of a **Psychium Z** crystal to telekinetically seize the target, overwhelming their mind and body with a crushing physical manifestation of psychic energy. The user strikes with full force, exerting massive mental pressure that translates into a devastating physical impact.
* **Effect:** This is a **Z-Move** that can only be used once per battle. Its base power is determined by the power of the original move it is based on (e.g., Zen Headbutt or Psychic Fangs). 
* **Secondary Effect:** As a Z-Move, it **bypasses accuracy checks**, meaning it cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig). It also deals 25% of its total damage if the target uses a protection move like Protect or Detect.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Powered Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** It is primarily used to secure a One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) on a defensive threat that would otherwise survive a standard hit. In the Gen VII competitive meta, it serves as a way to bypass the accuracy issues of moves like *Zen Headbutt*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Z-Move manifestation; while the base move (like Zen Headbutt) might make contact, the Z-Move itself is a specialized kinetic strike.

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Z-Move, its distribution is "Universal" among Pokémon that know a physical Psychic-type move while holding a **Psychium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Necrozma (Dusk Mane/Ultra):** Often utilized this to provide a massive burst of damage to break through neutral targets or delete Poison-types like Toxapex.
    * **Metagross (Mega):** Used it in Alolan formats to guarantee a hit with massive power, often converting *Zen Headbutt* into a 160-power nuke.
    * **Mew:** Frequently utilized Physical Psychic Z-moves in specialized lure sets to catch opponents off guard.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on physical attackers like **Gallade** or **Medicham** to ensure a high-accuracy finishing blow against bulky Poison-type walls.
* **Acquisition:** This move is triggered via the **Psychium Z** crystal, which is obtained during the island challenge in the Alola region (specifically in the Malie Garden in Sun/Moon).
