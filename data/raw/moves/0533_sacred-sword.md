## Identity & Mechanics
**Sacred Sword** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user attacks by slicing the target with a blade, horn, or edge of pure energy. This disciplined strike is so precise that it cuts through the target's spiritual or physical enhancements, ensuring the blow lands with its intended force regardless of the opponent's defensive preparations.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. During damage calculation, this move **ignores the target’s stat modifiers**, specifically Defense and Evasion boosts. (Note: It does not ignore the user's own Attack drops or the target's Reflect/Aurora Veil).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% focused on bypassing defensive buffs).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Anti-Setup.** It serves as a consistent Fighting-type move for physical attackers who cannot afford the defensive drops of *Close Combat*.
* **Usage:** While it has lower raw power than *Close Combat* (120) or *High Jump Kick* (130), Sacred Sword is the ultimate counter to "re-set" or "stall" tactics. It is specifically designed to punish Pokémon using **Iron Defense, Acid Armor, or Double Team**, making it a vital tool for breaking through "Cursing" walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is boosted by the **Sharpness** ability (introduced in Gen IX), which increases its power by 50% to a devastating 135 BP.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (20 learners), restricted almost exclusively to Pokémon with sword-like appendages or thematic ties to "holy" or "just" warriors.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature thematic move of the **Swords of Justice** (Cobalion, Terrakion, Virizion, and Keldeo). It is also a staple for **Zacian-Crowned**, **Aegislash**, and **Kartana**, all of whom benefit from its high accuracy and reliability.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Chien-Pao** and **Samurott (Hisuian)**. In Chien-Pao's case, it provides essential coverage against opposing Steel and Ice types that resist its dual STAB.
* **Acquisition:** It is **not available as a TM/TR**; it is learned exclusively through leveling up or as a "Relearner" move for specific legendary and blade-themed Pokémon.
