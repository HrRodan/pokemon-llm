## Identity & Mechanics
**Veevee Volley** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** This move represents the ultimate bond between a Trainer and their Eevee. The user lunges at the opponent with a surge of affectionate energy, channeling their mutual trust into a powerful physical strike. The visual execution involves Eevee leaping into the air and slamming into the target with glowing aura, ensuring the attack never fails to connect.
* **Effect:** The power of this move is determined by the Pokémon's Friendship (Affection) level. At maximum friendship, its base power reaches **102**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** This move is a **Sure-hit** attack, meaning it bypasses all accuracy and evasion modifiers to always strike the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales to 102], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Let's Go, Eevee!*, this serves as the premier STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for the Partner Eevee. It is essentially a superior version of *Return*, offering the same maximum damage output but with the added benefit of being a **Sure-hit** move, making it a hard counter to evasion-stacking strategies or accuracy-lowering moves like Flash or Sand Attack. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, but provides neutral coverage against almost everything except Rock, Steel, and Ghost.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it will trigger effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users

* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the **Partner Eevee** in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a "Partner Move," it cannot be passed to other Pokémon via breeding or Sketch, nor is it available to standard Eevee caught in the wild or transferred to other generations.
* **Acquisition:** Available only via a special Move Tutor found in Pokémon Centers (specifically in Celadon City) in the *Let's Go* series. It is not available as a TM or TR in any other generation.
