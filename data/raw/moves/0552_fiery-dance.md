## Identity & Mechanics
**Fiery Dance** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user envelops its body in an aura of intense, swirling flames and performs a rhythmic, flapping dance. This elegant display of pyrotechnics combines offensive pressure with a self-empowering ritual, often associated with moth-like Pokémon mimicking the sun.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a high probability of increasing the user's offensive momentum.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to raise the user’s **Special Attack** stat by one stage (+1).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Snowball Sweeper / Offensive Setup.** 
* **Usage:** Fiery Dance is often preferred over Flamethrower (90 BP) or Fire Blast (110 BP) despite its lower base power because of its incredible 50% proc rate for Special Attack boosts. It allows a Pokémon to deal damage while simultaneously preparing for a sweep, making it a "low-risk, high-reward" move that punishes passive play or switches. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Steel, Grass, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. Bypasses certain defensive abilities that trigger upon contact (like Rough Skin), but is stopped by Bulletproof or Flash Fire.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (only 2 learners), serving as a signature move for the Volcarona lineage.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Volcarona:** The primary user; Fiery Dance synergizes perfectly with *Quiver Dance*, allowing Volcarona to boost its Special Attack to astronomical levels while maintaining offensive pressure.
    * **Iron Moth:** The Future Paradox relative of Volcarona, which utilizes this move to maintain its role as a high-speed Special Nuke and late-game cleaner.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is almost never seen as coverage on non-Fire types. It is strictly a specialized tool for these specific moth-themed Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** It is **not available as a TM or TR** in any generation. It must be learned via level-up, making it a prestigious and rare move in the competitive circuit.
