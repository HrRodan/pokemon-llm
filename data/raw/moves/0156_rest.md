## Identity & Mechanics
**Rest** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user curls up and enters a deep, restorative slumber, shielding itself from further exhaustion while its body rapidly heals. This move is a staple for defensive behemoths, allowing them to rejuvenate mid-battle at the cost of temporary vulnerability.
* **Effect:** The user falls asleep for exactly two turns and fully restores its HP. Crucially, the Sleep status inflicted by Rest replaces any existing major status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Poison, or Freeze), effectively acting as a full status cleanser.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it fails if the user is already at full HP, already asleep, or if the field/ability prevents sleep (e.g., Electric Terrain, Insomnia, or Uproar).
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Hard Recovery** / **Status Cleanser**.
* **Usage:** Rest is the most common form of recovery for Pokémon that lack access to "instant" healing moves like *Recover* or *Soft-Boiled*. Its primary drawback is the two turns of inactivity, making the user "setup bait" for the opponent. To mitigate this, it is almost exclusively paired with the move **Sleep Talk** (the "RestTalk" strategy) or a **Chesto Berry** (the "Chesto-Rest" strategy) to wake up immediately. It is a vital tool for **Stall** and **Bulky Offense** teams to outlast the opposition.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails under the effects of *Heal Block*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Rest has a **Universal** distribution (1,240 learners), making it one of the most widely available moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Snorlax:** The most iconic user of the move; its high bulk and access to *Curse* allow it to utilize Rest to become an unkillable late-game sweeper.
    * **Suicune:** Famous for the "Crocune" set (Calm Mind, Rest, Sleep Talk, Scald), using Rest to ignore status and chip damage.
    * **Dondozo:** A modern defensive titan that uses Rest to reset its health and ignore the Attack drop from Burn.
    * **Garganacl:** Often uses Rest in conjunction with its high natural defenses to stall out opponents.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a "coverage" move in the offensive sense, it is frequently seen on **Kyogre** and **Groudon** in restricted formats to provide them with a way to stay healthy against chip damage and entry hazards.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible, appearing as **TM44** (Gen 1-7), **TR21** (Gen 8), and **TM085** (Gen 9) in nearly every game.
