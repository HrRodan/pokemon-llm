## Identity & Mechanics
**Aerial Ace** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user confounds the target with blinding speed, then slashes with surgical precision. This attack is executed so rapidly that it is impossible to dodge, allowing the user to strike regardless of visibility, smoke, or the target's evasive maneuvers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move is guaranteed to hit the target, bypassing all accuracy and evasion modifiers (including *Minimize*).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy ∞%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Evasion Counter.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low compared to heavy-hitters like **Brave Bird** or **Dual Wingbeat**, Aerial Ace serves as a reliable finishing move. It is the premier answer to "Evasion-stalling" strategies or Pokémon utilizing moves like *Double Team* or *Minimize*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting,** and **Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Iron Barbs*. In newer generations, it can be boosted by the **Technician** ability, bringing its power to a respectable 90.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (417 learners), making it one of the most accessible coverage moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Scyther/Scizor** (who benefit from the *Technician* boost), **Staraptor**, and **Ninjask**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Flying Pokémon like **Kartana**, **Lucario**, and **Garchomp** to provide essential coverage against 4x-weak Bug or Fighting types when more powerful Flying-type options are unavailable.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in almost every generation since its debut, often found early to mid-game to help players deal with high-evasion opponents.
