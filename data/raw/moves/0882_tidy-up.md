## Identity & Mechanics
**Tidy Up** is a status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user meticulously tidies the battlefield, sweeping away debris, traps, and tactical obstructions. This focused burst of productivity leaves the user feeling refreshed and physically primed, significantly enhancing their combat readiness. It is a dual-purpose move that combines elite hazard removal with offensive stat amplification.
* **Effect:** Removes the effects of **Spikes, Stealth Rock, Sticky Web, and Toxic Spikes** from both sides of the field. Additionally, it removes any active **Substitutes** from both the user and the opponent.
* **Secondary Effect:** Upon successful use, it increases the user's **Attack** and **Speed** stats by one stage each (+1 Atk, +1 Spe).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user and the entire field state.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Setup Sweeper / Hazard Control.**
* **Usage:** Tidy Up is considered a strictly superior version of *Dragon Dance* for the Pokémon that learn it, as it provides the same offensive boosts while simultaneously performing the role of *Rapid Spin* or *Defog*. Its ability to bypass accuracy checks and clear the field of **Substitutes** makes it a potent counter to "Sub-Seed" strategies and heavy hazard stack teams. Because it clears hazards on both sides, it requires careful timing if the user has also set hazards on the opponent's side.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal direct damage but is highly effective at enabling sweeps against teams reliant on **Entry Hazards** for chip damage.
* **Attributes:** This move is not blocked by *Protect* or *Detect* (as it targets the user/field), and it is not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution, restricted to a small group of "tidy" or "organized" Pokémon (6 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Maushold** (both Family of Three and Four) and **Cinccino**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Maushold**, Tidy Up is a cornerstone of its kit, allowing it to clear the field before unleashing a devastating, STAB-boosted, Technician-amplified *Population Bomb*. **Furret** and **Minccino** also utilize it to transition from utility roles into late-game cleaners.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor, making it a specialized "signature" utility for its specific evolutionary lines.
