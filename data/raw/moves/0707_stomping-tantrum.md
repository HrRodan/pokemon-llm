## Identity & Mechanics
**Stomping Tantrum** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Driven by intense frustration, the user repeatedly stomps the ground with seismic force to strike the opponent. This move is specifically designed to channel the user's "rage" from a previous failure into a devastating tremor. It is a highly tactical move often used to punish defensive plays or predicted immunities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The power of the move doubles from 75 to **150** if the user’s previous move failed for any reason (e.g., the target used Protect, the user flinched, the move missed) or if the move was completely ineffective due to type immunities (e.g., a Fighting move used against a Ghost-type).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75 (Potential 150), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Technical Counter-play.
* **Usage:** Stomping Tantrum serves as a safer, single-target alternative to **Earthquake** (which hits allies in Doubles) and a more accurate alternative to **High Horsepower** (95% Accuracy). It is a staple in VGC (Doubles) because it punishes the opponent for using **Protect** or **Detect**—if an opponent blocks a Pokémon's move, that Pokémon can follow up with a 150 BP Stomping Tantrum on the next turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (315 learners), making it one of the most accessible Ground-type coverage options in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Incineroar**, **Metagross**, and **Garchomp**. It is also a thematic signature-style move for **Mudsdale** and **Excadrill**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Rillaboom**, **Tyranitar**, and **Dragonite** to provide a reliable way to hit Steel and Poison-type checks without the collateral damage of Earthquake.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in Gen VIII and Gen IX, ensuring almost any physical attacker with legs or a heavy body can learn it.
