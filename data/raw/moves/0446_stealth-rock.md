## Identity & Mechanics
**Stealth Rock** is a status Rock-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user summons a swarm of levitating, jagged stone shards that surround the opposing Pokémon’s field. These sharp rocks remain suspended in the air, creating a persistent entry hazard that pierces and gashes any foe that switches into battle. This move is designed to punish switching and break focus sashes or "Sturdy" abilities.
* **Effect:** Sets an entry hazard on the opponent's side. Any Pokémon switching in takes damage based on its elemental weakness to the Rock type.
    * **4x Resistance:** 3.125% (1/32) Max HP
    * **2x Resistance:** 6.25% (1/16) Max HP
    * **Neutral:** 12.5% (1/8) Max HP
    * **2x Weakness:** 25% (1/4) Max HP
    * **4x Weakness:** 50% (1/2) Max HP
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though it is removed from the field by moves like **Rapid Spin**, **Defog**, **Tidy Up**, or the ability **Court Change**.
* **Targeting:** Opponent's Side (Field Effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Entry Hazard / Meta-Defining Support.
* **Usage:** Widely considered the most important move in competitive singles. Unlike **Spikes**, which requires three layers for maximum impact and does not affect Flying-types, Stealth Rock requires only one turn to set and hits every Pokémon (unless they hold **Heavy-Duty Boots**). It is the primary tool for checking Fire, Flying, Bug, and Ice-type threats, often limiting their ability to switch in multiple times.
* **Matchups:** It is exceptionally lethal against Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Rock, such as **Charizard**, **Volcarona**, and **Moltres**, stripping half their health upon entry.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; ignores "Protect" (sets the hazard regardless).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (261 learners), primarily found among Rock, Ground, and Steel-types, though many Psychic and Fairy-types also have access.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Gliscor**, who often use it as a lead move or on a forced switch.
* **Defensive Setters:** Bulky walls like **Ferrothorn**, **Blissey**, and **Great Tusk** utilize their longevity to ensure the hazard stays on the field throughout the match.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon like **Clefable**, **Mew**, and **Jirachi** to provide team support while serving as utility pivots.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in almost every generation since its debut, making it a staple on almost every serious competitive team.
