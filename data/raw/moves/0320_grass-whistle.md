## Identity & Mechanics
**Grass Whistle** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** The user picks a blade of grass or a leaf and blows across it, producing a soothing, rhythmic melody. This pleasant whistle resonates through the air to lull the target into a deep slumber. Because it is a **Sound-based move**, it possesses the unique property of bypassing the move **Substitute**, though it is completely nullified by the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Effect:** Causes the target to fall under the **Sleep** status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 55%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** High-Risk Utility / Sleep Inducer.
* **Usage:** Grass Whistle is generally considered a high-risk, low-reward option compared to other sleep-inducing moves. It is the Grass-type equivalent of *Sing*. In competitive play, it is almost universally outclassed by **Sleep Powder** (75% Accuracy) and the 100% accurate **Spore**. Its only distinct niche is its **Sound** attribute, which allows it to put a target to sleep even if they are behind a Substitute—a feat Sleep Powder cannot achieve. Despite this, its 55% accuracy makes it highly unreliable in serious matches.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute, blocked by Soundproof). It does not affect Pokémon with the **Insomnia**, **Vital Spirit**, or **Sweet Veil** abilities. Unlike many Grass-type status moves, it is *not* a powder-based move, meaning it can technically affect other Grass-types and is not blocked by **Overcoat** or **Safety Goggles**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, primarily limited to 22 Pokémon, almost all of which are Grass-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously associated with the **Roselia** line (including Roserade and Budew), **Shaymin (Land Forme)**, and **Abomasnow**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** While it is not a "coverage" move in terms of damage, it provides a utility option for Pokémon like **Leafeon** or **Carnivine** that may lack more accurate sleep-inducing moves like Sleep Powder.
* **Acquisition:** It is a rare move that is primarily learned through level-up or as an **Egg Move**. It has never been available as a **TM or TR**, limiting its accessibility to a specific pool of botanical Pokémon.
