## Identity & Mechanics
**Diamond Storm** is a physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user magically compresses the carbon in the air, whipping up a glittering, lethal vortex of razor-sharp diamonds to shred opposing Pokémon. This move is characterized by its immense beauty and overwhelming physical force, serving as the definitive signature move of the Jewel Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to all adjacent opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** There is a **50% chance** to raise the user’s **Defense stat by two stages (+2)**. In Double Battles, this check occurs for each target hit, making it highly likely to trigger the boost if both opponents are struck.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Signature Wallbreaking Nuke** / **Tank Enabler**.
* **Usage:** Diamond Storm is one of the best Rock-type moves in the game, drastically outclassing Stone Edge due to its superior accuracy (95% vs 80%) and its transformative secondary effect. The 50% chance to double the user's Defense allows a Pokémon like Diancie to become an impenetrable physical wall while simultaneously dealing heavy damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact, Spread Move (reduces damage to 75% in doubles but hits both foes).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the exclusive signature move of the Diancie evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Mythical Pokémon **Diancie** and its powerful Mega Evolution, **Mega Diancie**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its exclusive nature, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon; however, for Mega Diancie, it provides essential STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) that punishes Flying-types like Yveltal or Ho-Oh.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned by Diancie via leveling up or upon evolving/encountering it in special events.
