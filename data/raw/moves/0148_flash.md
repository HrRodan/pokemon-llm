## Identity & Mechanics
**Flash** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user emits a sudden, searing burst of light from its body or eyes, momentarily blinding the target. This intense luminance disorients the opponent, causing their vision to blur and significantly reducing their ability to land precise strikes.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target's Accuracy stat by one stage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (Status), Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Flash is historically considered a "gimmick" or "niche" move in competitive play due to the unreliability of evasion-based strategies. While it provides an immediate **Accuracy Check** on the opponent, it is largely outclassed by moves that provide more concrete utility, such as *Will-O-Wisp* (burn/attack drop) or *Thunder Wave* (paralysis/speed drop). In early generations, it was notoriously known as a mandatory **HM (Hidden Machine)** required to navigate dark caves.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and therefore cannot hit for Super Effective damage. However, being a Normal-type status move, it **can** affect Ghost-types, unlike Normal-type physical or special attacks.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypassed by Pokémon with the *Keen Eye* ability or those under the effect of *Victory Star*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Flash has an exceptionally wide distribution (353 total learners), historically due to its status as HM05 or a common TM.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently learned by high-intellect or light-based Pokémon such as **Alakazam**, **Ampharos**, **Starmie**, and **Pikachu**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often found in the movepools of Pokémon that lack natural blinding capabilities but can produce light, such as **Zapdos** (Electric/Flying) and **Ferrothorn** (Grass/Steel). In a competitive "Stall" or "Troll" set, it may be used by **Sableye** to force switches by making the opponent's attacks unreliable.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/HM** across almost every generation except the most recent ones, where its field utility was replaced by Poke-Ride or automatic lighting mechanics.
