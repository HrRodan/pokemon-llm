## Identity & Mechanics
**Confusion** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user projects a pulse of telekinetic energy or a weak psychic wave directly into the target's mind. This mental assault causes minor physical damage and may disrupt the target's cognitive functions, leading to disorientation. It is often the first offensive Psychic-type move many Pokémon learn.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to inflict the **Confusion** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Confusion is almost never utilized as it is strictly outclassed by **Psybeam** (65 Power) and the standard-bearing **Psychic** (90 Power). Its primary function is to provide reliable STAB damage for Psychic-type Pokémon during the early leveling stages of a playthrough. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Special attack and does not make contact. It is not affected by properties like "Sound-based" or "Punching," but its damage is increased by the **Psychic Terrain** field effect.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (128 learners), serving as the foundational move for the majority of Psychic-type species.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic Psychic-types learn this naturally at low levels, including **Alakazam**, **Gardevoir**, **Mewtwo**, and **Metagross**.
* **Coverage Utility:** It is occasionally found on non-Psychic Pokémon as early-game coverage, notably by **Butterfree**, **Venomoth**, and **Golduck** to help them handle Poison or Fighting-type threats before they gain access to stronger moves.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a staple level-up move, it is rarely featured as a TM or TR in modern generations, as those slots are reserved for higher-power alternatives like *Psyshock* or *Psychic*.
