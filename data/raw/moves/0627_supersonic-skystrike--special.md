## Identity & Mechanics
**Supersonic Skystrike (Special)** is a Special Flying-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This move represents the absolute pinnacle of Flying-type offensive energy. The user builds up its Z-Power and strikes the target with the force of a supersonic gale. In its Special iteration, the user channels high-velocity winds or concentrated aerial pressure to overwhelm the opponent, often manifesting as a diving atmospheric blast or a devastating vortex.
* **Effect:** This is a **Z-Move** triggered by a Pokémon holding **Flyinium Z** while knowing a Special Flying-type base move (such as Air Slash or Hurricane). It deals massive damage and bypasses the accuracy check to always hit the target. It can also deal 25% "chip" damage through protection moves like Protect or Detect.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, its power is determined by the base move used to trigger it (ranging from 100 to 200 Power).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **One-Time Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the Generation VII competitive meta to bypass the low accuracy of **Hurricane** or to provide a massive burst of damage that can OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) bulky Fighting, Bug, or Grass-type threats. It is a "Consistency Option" that turns a high-variance move into a guaranteed hit for one crucial turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; Power scales based on the base move; consumes the user's Z-Move slot for the duration of the battle.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Distribution is "Universal" among any Pokémon that can learn a Special Flying-type move and hold the Flyinium Z crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Togekiss:** Often uses this move paired with *Air Slash* to secure KOs on Steel-types after chip damage or to eliminate bulky targets that resist its Fairy STAB.
    * **Tornadus-Therian:** Uses it in conjunction with *Hurricane* to provide a 100% accurate, high-power nuke that ignores the move's usual accuracy flaws in non-rain weather.
    * **Zapdos:** Occasionally carries Flyinium Z to turn *Hurricane* into a massive burst of Flying-type damage to catch traditional checks like Clefable off-guard.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Volcarona** or **Salamence (Special sets)**. Volcarona uses it via *Hurricane* to lure and destroy traditional counters like Toxapex or Araquanid. 
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Flyinium Z** crystal; the mechanic was retired in subsequent generations in favor of Dynamax and Terastalization.
