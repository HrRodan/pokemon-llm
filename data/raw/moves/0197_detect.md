## Identity & Mechanics
**Detect** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user sharpens its senses and focuses its reflexes to a peak, allowing it to completely evade all incoming attacks for the duration of the turn. This heightened state of awareness provides absolute protection against both physical and special moves, though its effectiveness drops sharply if used in rapid succession.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from nearly all move effects and damage for the remainder of the turn. It has a **+4 Priority** bracket, ensuring it almost always activates before the opponent can strike. The success rate of Detect is halved (50%) if the user successfully used Detect, Protect, Endure, Wide Guard, or Quick Guard on the previous turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Status Move).
* **Targeting:** Self (Affects the user).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Tactical Utility / Scouting.
* **Usage:** Detect is functionally identical to **Protect** but is significantly rarer and has much lower PP (5 vs. Protect's 10). In competitive play, Detect is often preferred over Protect to circumvent the move **Imprison**, as most Imprison users carry Protect to shut down opponents. It is essential for "stalling" out turns of weather (Rain/Sun), Trick Room, or Field Terrain, and for scouting an opponent's choice-locked move.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks. Can be broken by moves like **Feint**, **Phantom Force**, or **Shadow Force**. Notably, the ability **Unseen Fist** (held by Urshifu) allows contact moves to bypass this protection entirely.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (159 learners), often associated with Pokémon known for high reflexes or martial arts prowess.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Lucario**, **Blaziken**, **Iron Hands**, and **Zapdos-Galar**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Sableye** (Prankster) and **Medicham** to safely scout moves or facilitate Mega Evolution/Terastalization timing. 
* **Acquisition:** While it was a TM in the Johto era (Gold/Silver/Crystal), it has since become much more exclusive, primarily learned via level-up or as an Egg Move in modern generations.
