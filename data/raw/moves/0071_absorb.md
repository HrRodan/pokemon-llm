## Identity & Mechanics
**Absorb** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user siphons life energy from the target through roots, vines, or a bio-organic aura to replenish its own vitality. This move functions as a basic sustain tool, converting offensive pressure into immediate health recovery. It is the foundational move of the "Drain" family, preceding Mega Drain and Giga Drain.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and restores the user’s HP by 50% of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single adjacent target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game Sustain / Chip Recovery.
* **Usage:** In a competitive vacuum, Absorb is almost never utilized due to its extremely low base power, which results in negligible healing. It is strictly outclassed by **Giga Drain** (Power 75) and **Mega Drain** (Power 40). Its primary utility is restricted to "Little Cup" early levels or in-game progression where recovery options are scarce. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "King's Rock" flinch checks if the damage is zero; interacts with the **Big Root** item to increase HP recovery by 30%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution across Grass-types and certain biological "leech" themed Pokémon (98 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to early-stage Grass starters and plant-based Pokémon like **Treecko (Sceptile)**, **Oddish (Vileplume)**, and **Turtwig (Torterra)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically associated with the **Zubat** line (Crobat) as an early-game leveling tool, and surprisingly found on high-tier threats like **Volcarona** (via Larvesta) and **Celesteela**, though rarely used over more powerful options.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through natural level-up. It is rarely featured as a TM/TR in modern generations, as it is typically replaced by its higher-tier counterparts for mid-to-late game progression.
