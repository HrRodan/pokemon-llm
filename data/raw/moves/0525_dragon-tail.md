## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Tail** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user lashes out with a heavy, scale-covered tail, striking the target with immense force. The blow is so disruptive that it physically knocks the opponent away, forcing their trainer to send out a different Pokémon at random to continue the fight. In the wild, this concussive force is enough to end the encounter immediately.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and forces the target to switch out for a random teammate. Because of the winding-up motion required for such a heavy hit, this move has a **low priority (-6)**, ensuring the user usually moves last. It fails if the target has a **Substitute**, the ability **Suction Cups**, the move **Ingrain**, or is the trainer's last remaining Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Effect chance: N/A).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Phazing Utility** / **Entry Hazard Punisher**.
* **Usage:** Unlike the status moves *Roar* or *Whirlwind*, Dragon Tail deals chip damage while shuffling the opponent’s team. It is primarily used on defensive "walls" to rack up damage from **Stealth Rock**, **Spikes**, or **Toxic Spikes**. It is also a premier tool for stopping "setup sweepers" (Pokémon using Dragon Dance or Swords Dance), as forcing them out clears their stat boosts. However, its 90% accuracy and inability to affect **Fairy-types** (who are immune) make it a calculated risk.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Dragon Tail has a wide distribution (140 learners), primarily found among reptilian, draconic, or heavy-bodied Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a staple on defensive behemoths and legendary dragons such as **Garchomp**, **Zygarde (Complete/50%)**, **Giratina**, and **Dragonite**. **Duraludon/Archaludon** also utilize it effectively to control the field.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon defensive pivots like **Milotic**, **Steelix**, and **Tyranitar** to prevent opponents from using them as "setup fodder." **Salazzle** occasionally uses it for niche utility despite its frail stats.
* **Acquisition:** It has been a widely available **TM (TM82 in Gen 5-7, TM169 in Gen 9)** across almost every generation since its debut, making it easily accessible for most Pokémon with a tail.
