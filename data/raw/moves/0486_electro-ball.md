## Identity & Mechanics
**Electro Ball** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user concentrates electrical energy into a dense, glowing orb and hurls it at the target. This move is unique because its impact force is determined by the momentum of the user relative to the target; the more the user outpaces their opponent in terms of raw Speed, the more devastating the electrical discharge becomes upon impact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts variable damage based on the ratio of the user’s Speed stat to the target’s Speed stat.
    * **60 Power:** User's Speed is less than 2× the target's.
    * **80 Power:** User's Speed is 2× or more, but less than 3× the target's.
    * **120 Power:** User's Speed is 3× or more, but less than 4× the target's.
    * **150 Power:** User's Speed is 4× or more than the target's.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable 60–150], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Speed-Scaling Nuke / Conditional Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Electro Ball is a high-ceiling alternative to **Thunderbolt** (90 BP) or **Thunder** (110 BP). It becomes mathematically superior to Thunderbolt once the user is at least 3× faster than the target. It is most effective when paired with **Paralysis** support (which quarters the target's speed) or on Pokémon with extreme Speed tiers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. It is particularly lethal on "Speedsters" and can bypass the usual damage caps of reliable STAB moves when facing slow, defensive walls.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (107 learners), primarily concentrated among Electric-types and exceptionally fast Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Regieleki:** With the highest base Speed in the game, it reaching the 150 BP threshold against most of the unboosted metagame.
    * **Raichu-Alola:** Utilizes the *Surge Surfer* ability in Electric Terrain to double its Speed, making Electro Ball a massive STAB nuke.
    * **Pikachu:** Often uses this as a primary Special STAB option in various formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon like **Cinderace** and **Gholdengo**. Cinderace can use its high natural Speed and *Libero* ability to gain STAB on the move, providing unexpected Special coverage against bulky Water-types like Toxapex or Dondozo.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM80** (Sword/Shield) and **TM072** (Scarlet/Violet).
