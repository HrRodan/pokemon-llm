## Identity & Mechanics
**Tail Slap** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user lashes out with its tail in a rapid-fire sequence of strikes, whipping the opponent repeatedly with high-velocity kinetic energy. This move is a multi-strike attack that bypasses "one-hit" protections by delivering a flurry of blows in a single turn.
* **Effect:** Hits the target 2–5 times in one turn. Statistically, it has a 37.5% chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit 4 or 5 times. Each strike is calculated independently for Critical Hits.
* **Secondary Effect:** No direct secondary status effect, but its multi-hit nature allows it to interact uniquely with items like **King's Rock** (increased flinch chance) or **Loaded Dice** (ensures more hits).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (Per Hit), Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Multi-Strike Nuke** / **Focus Sash Breaker**. 
* **Usage:** While its base accuracy is shaky, Tail Slap is a devastating **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for Pokémon with the **Skill Link** ability, which forces the move to always hit 5 times. At 5 hits, it becomes a 125-power move with no recoil, outdamaging reliable options like Return or Body Slam. It is specifically used to pierce through **Substitute**, **Focus Sash**, and the **Sturdy** ability.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **resisted by Rock and Steel** and has **no effect on Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (26 total learners), primarily localized to Pokémon with prominent or dexterous tails.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Cinccino** (the premier Skill Link user), **Ambipom** (via Aipom), and **Greedent**.
* **Coverage & Legendaries:** Interestingly, it is learned by high-tier legendaries like **Zacian**, **Zamazenta**, and **Fezandipiti**, though it is rarely chosen over their signature steel or fairy-type physical moves.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **Technical Record 50 (TR50)** in Generation VIII, allowing various physical attackers to utilize it for niche multi-hit utility.
