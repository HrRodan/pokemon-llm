## Identity & Mechanics
**Glaive Rush** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user, typically utilizing the dorsal fin or "glaive" on its back, throws its entire body into a reckless, high-velocity charge. This devastating maneuver creates a massive opening in the user's defenses; until the user's next action, any incoming attacks are guaranteed to hit and will deal double damage. It is the signature move of the pseudo-legendary Pokémon **Baxcalibur**.
* **Effect:** Deals massive damage but applies a "vulnerable" state to the user. During this state, the user cannot evade attacks, and all damage received is multiplied by 2.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The drawback is a field effect/state rather than a stat drop).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Glaive Rush is an incredibly potent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option that serves as a more controlled alternative to **Outrage**. Unlike Outrage, it does not lock the user into the move for multiple turns, allowing for tactical switching or move selection. However, the double-damage penalty makes the user extremely susceptible to **Priority moves** (like Extreme Speed or Mach Punch) and **Revenge Killers**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a unique signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Baxcalibur**. The move defines Baxcalibur's identity in the competitive circuit (especially in Smogon OU or VGC), allowing it to dismantle defensive cores.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can learn this move via TM, TR, or Breeding. It is strictly limited to the Baxcalibur evolutionary line.
* **Acquisition:** Learned by Baxcalibur upon evolution or at high levels; it is not available as a TM.
