## Identity & Mechanics
**Judgment** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh) as the signature technique of the Alpha Pokémon, Arceus.

* **Description:** The user calls upon divine power to release a barrage of countless shots of cosmic light from the heavens upon the target. This move is unique in its elemental flexibility; while naturally a Normal-type attack, its energy shifting properties cause its type to change to match the elemental Plate or specific held item (like a Z-Crystal) equipped by the user. This ensures the move always benefits from **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** when used by Arceus.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. The move's type is determined by the Plate held by the user. If no Plate is held, it remains a Normal-type move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** Judgment is the gold standard for special attacking Arceus sets in the Ubers and Anything Goes tiers. It is prized for its perfect accuracy and high base power, making it more reliable than alternatives like *Hydro Pump* or *Focus Blast*. Because Arceus changes its own type to match its held Plate via the **Multitype** ability, Judgment functions as a universal STAB move that can hit any target for **Super Effective** damage depending on which form of Arceus is being utilized (e.g., Arceus-Ground using Ground-type Judgment to hit Electric types).
* **Attributes:** This move is non-contact and is not blocked by protection such as *Bulletproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, being the exclusive **Signature Move** of a single Mythical Pokémon.

* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Arceus**. It is the defining move for all 18 of its elemental forms (Arceus-Fairy, Arceus-Ghost, Arceus-Steel, etc.).
* **Coverage Utility:** While not used for coverage in the traditional sense (as it changes type with the user), it allows Arceus to bypass the need for diverse coverage by providing a high-powered, reliable STAB move for any elemental role it needs to fill on a team.
* **Acquisition:** Only available to Arceus via level-up (Level 100 in most generations). It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor.
