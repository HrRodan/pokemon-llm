* **Description:** The user centers their ki and heightens their mental focus to manifest a devastating sphere of pure energy, which is then launched at the opponent. This move represents the peak of special-based martial prowess, trading precision for immense destructive force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-magnitude special damage. It is a projectile-based move that does not make contact.

It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel,** and **Dark** types.
