## Identity & Mechanics
**Constrict** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user wraps its body, tentacles, or vines around the target and squeezes with persistent pressure. This restrictive grip is intended to hinder the opponent's mobility, though the physical force applied is minimal. It is a flavor-rich move typically associated with cephalopods, plants, and serpentine Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts negligible physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to lower the target’s Speed by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 10, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-game Filler / Obsolete Utility.
* **Usage:** Constrict is widely considered one of the weakest moves in the franchise. With a base power of only 10, it fails to provide any meaningful chip damage. Its secondary effect—a 10% chance to drop Speed—is statistically unreliable compared to moves like *Icy Wind* (100% Speed drop) or *Body Slam* (30% Paralysis chance). It is almost universally replaced as soon as a Pokémon learns a basic STAB move or a higher-power Normal move like *Return* or *Strength*.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **neutral damage** to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, and cannot hit **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (18 total learners), restricted primarily to Pokémon with physiological "binding" traits.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized in early level-up sets by **Tentacruel**, **Tangrowth**, and **Malamar**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for coverage, it appears in the movesets of the Ultra Beast **Nihilego** and the fossil Pokémon **Omastar** and **Cradily**, though it is never used in serious competitive builds for these Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** It is strictly a level-up move for most of its users. It has **no TM or TR availability**, emphasizing its status as a primitive, biological attack rather than a taught technique.
