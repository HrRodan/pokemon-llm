## Identity & Mechanics
**10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt** is a Special Electric-type Signature Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** Drawing upon the unique bond between Trainer and Pokémon, the user—specifically a Pikachu wearing a cap—concentrates an immense amount of Z-Power to discharge a colossal, rainbow-colored multi-pronged bolt of lightning. This move represents the pinnacle of Electric-type offensive power, saturating the battlefield with high-voltage energy that pierces through standard defenses.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive Special damage. This move has an **increased critical-hit ratio** (+2 stages), meaning it has a 50% chance to land a critical hit (in Gen VII mechanics), allowing it to bypass the target's defensive stat stages and screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** High Critical Hit Ratio.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **195**, Accuracy **—% (Never-Miss)**, PP **1**.
* **Role:** **Signature Z-Move Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** As a Z-Move, it is a one-time use tactical nuke. Unlike the standard Electric Z-Move, *Gigavolt Havoc*, this version has a slightly higher base power (if coming from Thunderbolt) and the crucial high-crit chance. It is specifically designed to delete a single threat from the field, regardless of evasion or defensive boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; requires the user to hold **Pikashunium Z** and know the move **Thunderbolt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, restricted exclusively to specific event Pokémon forms.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively usable by **Pikachu in a Cap** (including Original, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Partner Cap forms).
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is not used for coverage but rather as a specialized **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** finisher. Because it is tied to the Pikashunium Z crystal, the user cannot hold other items like Light Ball, making this move the primary reason to run Cap-form Pikachu in a competitive or casual setting.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the use of a Z-Crystal; it does not appear as a standard TM, TR, or HM.
