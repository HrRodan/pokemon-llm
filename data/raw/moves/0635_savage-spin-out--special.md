## Identity & Mechanics
**Savage Spin-Out (Special)** is a Special Bug-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user weaves a massive, sticky web to ensnare the target before spinning them at high speeds and violently slamming them down. This move represents the ultimate Special Bug-type attack, channeling Z-Power to create a inescapable, silk-themed vortex of destruction.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that upgrades a base Special Bug-type move (such as Bug Buzz or Signal Beam). Its Power is determined by the base move it is derived from.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, like most damaging Z-Moves, it **bypasses Accuracy checks** (Never-Miss) and can deal 25% of its total damage through protective moves like *Protect* or *Detect*.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–190], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats to bypass a Pokémon's usual checks. It allows a Special attacker to secure a "One-Hit Knockout" (OHKO) on a bulky Dark, Psychic, or Grass-type threat that might otherwise survive a standard Bug Buzz. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move; requires the user to hold **Buginium Z** and know a Special Bug-type move.
