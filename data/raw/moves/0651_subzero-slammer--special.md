## Identity & Mechanics
**Subzero Slammer (Special)** is a Special Ice-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** Utilizing the freezing energy of the Icium Z, the user manifests a colossal iceberg or unleashes a concentrated absolute-zero blizzard to crush the target. This move represents the peak of Ice-type offensive capability, channeling the bond between Trainer and Pokémon into a singular, devastating frost-based strike.
* **Effect:** This move is a Z-Move transformation of a base Special Ice-type move (such as Ice Beam or Blizzard). It bypasses all accuracy checks to always hit the target (unless the target is in the semi-invulnerable turn of a move like Fly or Dig). If the target uses a protection move like *Protect* or *Detect*, Subzero Slammer still deals 25% of its original damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Standard Z-Moves typically lose the secondary effects of their base moves in exchange for massive raw power).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200, based on base move], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Powered Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Subzero Slammer is used as a one-time "Delete Button" to secure a OHKO on a defensive threat that would otherwise survive a standard Ice-type attack. Unlike its rival Ice-type moves (Ice Beam's reliability or Blizzard's spread/power), Subzero Slammer provides a guaranteed hit with massive damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move; requires the user to hold an **Icium Z**; power scales based on the base move (e.g., a base *Blizzard* creates a 185 Power Z-Move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn at least one Special Ice-type move.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Kyurem (White/Black)** to break through extreme bulk, **Alolan Ninetales** for a high-accuracy alternative to Blizzard, and **Primarina** as a powerful secondary STAB option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon like **Greninja** or **Mew** to lure in and eliminate 4x Ice-weak threats such as Landorus-Therian, Gliscor, or Garchomp.
* **Acquisition:** Available to any Pokémon holding an **Icium Z** crystal that has a Special Ice-type move in its active moveset.
