## Identity & Mechanics
**Wide Guard** is a Status Rock-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova region).
* **Description:** The user creates a shimmering wide-angle barrier that shields itself and its allies from area-of-effect (AoE) attacks. This protective field is specifically designed to dissipate the energy of broad-reaching strikes such as shockwaves, tremors, and volleys that would otherwise hit multiple targets. 
* **Effect:** Protects the user and all allies from moves that target multiple Pokémon (spread moves) for the duration of the turn. This includes both damaging moves (e.g., Earthquake, Rock Slide) and status moves that hit multiple targets. It has a **Priority of +3**, ensuring it almost always activates before the opponent attacks. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, in modern generations (Gen VI onwards), its success rate may decrease if used consecutively with other protection moves like Protect or Detect.
* **Targeting:** Users-field (Affects all Pokémon on the user’s side).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Anti-Meta Tech.
* **Usage:** Wide Guard is a staple in **Double Battles (VGC)** and Triple Battles. Unlike Protect, which shields a single Pokémon from almost anything, Wide Guard specifically counters "Spread Move Spam." It is the premier answer to powerful multi-target threats like **Earthquake, Rock Slide, Heat Wave, Dazzling Gleam, and Hyper Voice**. While it does not deal damage, it provides immense "Value-Trading" by nullifying an opponent's entire turn if they relied on a spread move. It does not hit any types for damage but is categorized as a **Rock-type** move.
* **Attributes:** Priority move; fails if the user acts last in the turn; cannot be called by Assist or Metronome.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (71 learners), primarily found among Rock, Water, and Fighting-type Pokémon with defensive or "guardian" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Garganacl**, **Pelipper**, and **Zamazenta (Crowned Shield)**. Garganacl uses it to protect teammates while stalling with Salt Cure, while Pelipper uses it to shield allies from Electric-type spread moves like Discharge.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Araquanid** and **Swampert** to provide team support in VGC formats where spread-damage legendary Pokémon (like Calyrex-Shadow or Kyogre) are dominant.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up or as an Egg Move; it is notably **absent** from most TM/TR lists, making its presence on a team a deliberate and often telegraphed tactical choice.
