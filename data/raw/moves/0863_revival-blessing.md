## Identity & Mechanics
**Revival Blessing** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user performs a miraculous act of restoration, channeling a loving blessing to a fallen ally. This move reaches into the party's fainted reserves to breathe life back into a teammate, restoring them to a conscious state and mending their wounds. It is the first move in Pokémon history capable of reviving a fainted Pokémon during a standard battle.
* **Effect:** Revives one fainted Pokémon in the player's party, restoring **50% of its maximum HP**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** A fainted Pokémon in the user's party.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 1 (Max 2).
* **Role:** **High-Utility Game-Changer.** 
* **Usage:** Revival Blessing is a meta-defining move due to its ability to bring back a "win condition" or a crucial wall that has already been knocked out. Because it has only **1 PP**, it is often paired with a **Leppa Berry** to allow for a second use, effectively turning a 6v6 match into an 8v6. It is strictly superior to "Healing Wish" in terms of momentum preservation, as it doesn't require the user to faint, though the user must survive the turn to execute it.
* **Attributes:** This is a Status move; it is blocked by **Taunt**. As a non-damaging Normal-type move, its type rarely affects its performance unless facing "Liquid Voice" or similar ability-based type changes.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, being the signature mechanic for only two specific evolutionary lines (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Pawmot:** The most common user in competitive play. Pawmot benefits from high Speed and the "Iron Fist" or "Volt Absorb" abilities, allowing it to potentially pivot or KO an enemy before using Revival Blessing to bring back a heavy hitter like Gholdengo or Dragonite.
    * **Rabsca:** A slower, more defensive option. Rabsca is often used on **Trick Room** teams, where its low Speed allows it to move first under TR and safely revive a teammate.
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is not available as a TM/TR and cannot be learned by any Pokémon outside of the Pawmi and Rellor lines via breeding or Sketch (except by Smeargle).
* **Acquisition:** Exclusive to level-up learnsets in Generation IX for Pawmot and Rabsca.
