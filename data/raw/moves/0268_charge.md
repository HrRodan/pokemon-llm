## Identity & Mechanics
**Charge** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal battery or gathers ambient static electricity from the atmosphere, surrounding its body with a crackling aura of power. This concentration of energy fortifies the user's mental and molecular resilience against special attacks while priming its electrical conduits for a devastating discharge.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s **Special Defense by one stage**. Additionally, if the user successfully executes an Electric-type attacking move on the following turn, that move's **base power is doubled**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The power doubling is a primary mechanic of the move).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Setup / Defensive Utility / Damage Multiplier.
* **Usage:** While often considered slower than immediate offensive pressure, Charge serves a dual purpose as a "Bulk-up" tool for Special Defense and a "Nuke" primer. It is most effective when paired with high-accuracy STAB moves like *Thunderbolt* or high-risk/high-reward moves like *Thunder*. In modern competitive play, it has found a specific niche with Pokémon like **Bellibolt**, whose ability *Electromorphosis* synergies with the "Charged" state. It is generally outperformed by *Calm Mind* in long-term setups, but offers a more explosive immediate damage ceiling for Electric attacks.
* **Type Matchups:** Priming this move allows for massive damage against **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks (Self-targeting); effect is lost if the user switches out before using an Electric move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (97 learners), almost exclusively granted to Electric-type Pokémon or those with mechanical/metallic themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Zapdos**, **Ampharos**, and the Paradox Pokémon **Miraidon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Porygon-Z** or **Lanturn** to bolster their special bulk while threatening a massive retaliatory STAB hit. 
* **Strategic Niche:** Highly synergetic with **Bellibolt**, which can utilize the move to stack Special Defense while preparing a doubled-power *Parabolic Charge* for massive recovery.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
