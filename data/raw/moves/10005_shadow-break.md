## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Break** is a Physical Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically appearing in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user, a corrupted Shadow Pokémon, strikes the target with a burst of dark, suppressed energy. It represents a physical manifestation of the "door to the heart" being closed, resulting in a violent, aura-infused tackle or strike.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage. In the context of *Gale of Darkness* mechanics, Shadow moves are unique for being **Super Effective** against all non-Shadow Pokémon and "not very effective" against other Shadow Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (Shadow moves utilize a unique "Heart Gauge" mechanic rather than standard PP).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Universal Coverage.
* **Usage:** Within the Orre region games (*Pokémon XD*), Shadow Break serves as a mid-tier consistency move. It is the Shadow equivalent of moves like *Brick Break* or *Elemental Punches* (pre-Gen IV), providing high accuracy and decent power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow Pokémon**, making it an incredibly potent tool for clearing through standard trainers.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a **Shadow** move; it cannot be used outside of the Orre-based titles and is replaced if the Pokémon is "Purified."

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, restricted entirely to **Shadow Pokémon** encountered in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously used by **Shadow Teddiursa** (the first Shadow Pokémon obtained in *XD*), **Shadow Poochyena**, and **Shadow Houndour**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Shadow moves ignore traditional type matchups in favor of the Shadow-vs-Non-Shadow mechanic, this move is used by Shadow Pokémon to bypass their usual type resistances (e.g., a Shadow Pokémon using this to hit a Steel or Rock type for Super Effective damage).
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor. It is a "natural" move known by corrupted Pokémon upon capture.
