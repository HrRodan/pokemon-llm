## Identity & Mechanics
**Sludge Wave** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user summons a massive, biohazardous tsunami of toxic filth and industrial sludge that swamps the entire battlefield. This deluge of caustic miasma is designed to drown opponents in pollution, leaving a lingering corrosive residue.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent Special damage to all adjacent Pokémon. It is a staple for Poison-type special attackers looking for raw power over utility.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to inflict the Poison status condition on the target(s).
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (Hits both opponents in Doubles; also hits ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Fairy-Type Check / Spread Attacker.
* **Usage:** Sludge Wave is often preferred over its rival, *Sludge Bomb*, in two specific scenarios: when the user has the **Sheer Force** ability (to maximize damage) or to bypass the **Bulletproof** ability (which grants immunity to "ball and bomb" moves like Sludge Bomb). In Doubles, it acts as a powerful spread move, though it requires a teammate with the Steel type, Telepathy, or Protect to avoid friendly fire. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses effects that specifically block "bomb" or "ball" projectiles.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (112 learners), making it the gold standard for special Poison-type offense.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Nidoking** and **Landorus-Incarnate** (who both utilize *Sheer Force* to turn Sludge Wave into a devastating nuke), **Gengar**, **Nihilego**, and the legendary **Eternatus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon like **Landorus**, **Thundurus**, and **Greninja** to provide vital coverage against Fairy-type threats that otherwise resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a TM (TM95 in Gen 5/6, TR22 in Gen 8, TM148 in Gen 9) across almost every generation since its debut.
