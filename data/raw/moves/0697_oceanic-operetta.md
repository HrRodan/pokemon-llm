## Identity & Mechanics
**Oceanic Operetta** is a Special Water-type move introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** As a signature Z-Move, Primarina uses its Z-Power to manipulate a massive sphere of water through its lyrical singing. It levitates the orb over the target before causing it to explode with immense pressure, drenching the battlefield in a cinematic display of oceanic force.
* **Effect:** This is a **Signature Z-Move** that can only be used by Primarina holding a Primarium Z. It converts the move **Sparkling Aria** into a one-time high-damage nuke.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (This move focuses purely on raw damage output).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **195**, Accuracy **—%** (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP **1**.
* **Role:** **Signature Wallbreaker / One-time Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Oceanic Operetta serves as Primarina’s ultimate weapon in Generation VII competitive formats (like VGC 2017/2018 or Smogon OU). At 195 Power, it is significantly stronger than a standard *Hydro Vortex* (which would have 175 power if converted from Sparkling Aria). It is used to delete defensive checks or to secure a knockout on bulky neutral targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **Sound-based** in its thematic execution, though mechanically it is treated as a standard Z-Move. It ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers, making it a guaranteed hit unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Dive or Dig).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (Only 1 evolutionary line).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Primarina**. It requires the Pokémon to know the move **Sparkling Aria** and be holding the **Primarium Z** crystal.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature Z-Move, it has no coverage utility for other Pokémon. It is the defining feature of offensive Primarina sets in Alola-based formats, allowing it to bypass its usual reliance on the lower-accuracy Hydro Pump for heavy burst damage.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Primarium Z** crystal, often obtained after receiving the Primarina-specific Z-Crystal from Hau or Professor Kukui during the main story or post-game.
