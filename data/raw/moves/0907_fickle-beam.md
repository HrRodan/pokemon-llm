## Identity & Mechanics
**Fickle Beam** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a concentrated beam of draconic energy from its multiple heads. While usually a standard beam of light, the "fickle" nature of the user’s focus means that occasionally all heads fire simultaneously in a devastating, synchronized blast. This move is characterized by its high-variance output and visual flair involving multiple laser-like projectiles.
* **Effect:** Deals damage with a baseline power of 80. However, there is a **30% chance** that the move will "double in power," effectively hitting with a **160 Base Power** for that turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** Power doubling (30% activation rate).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80 (standard) / 160 (boosted), Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Roll Nuke / Signature STAB.
* **Usage:** Fickle Beam serves as a unique alternative to *Dragon Pulse* or *Draco Meteor*. While its base power is consistent with Dragon Pulse, the 30% chance to transform into a 160 BP nuke—exceeding even Draco Meteor without the Special Attack drop—makes it a high-reward option. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, beam-based move. It is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution, functioning as a signature move (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently the signature move of **Hydrapple**. Its multiple heads (the "Syrpents" living inside the apple) are thematic requirements for the move's power-doubling mechanic.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is limited to Hydrapple, it is primarily used as a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option rather than a coverage move for other Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via leveling up or upon evolution of Dipplin into Hydrapple; it is not available as a TM or Move Tutor move for other species.
