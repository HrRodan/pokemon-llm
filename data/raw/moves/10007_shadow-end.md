## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow End** is a Physical Shadow-type move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically appearing in the spin-off title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user harnesses the chaotic, suppressed energy of its closed heart to deliver a devastating, reckless physical tackle. Surrounded by a dark, swirling aura of negative energy, the Pokémon throws its entire weight into the opponent, resulting in a violent collision that strains the user's own life force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant physical damage to the target. However, the sheer force of the move causes the user to take **recoil damage equal to 1/2 of its current HP**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 60%, PP [N/A].
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke.** It functions as a powerful but highly inaccurate finishing move for Shadow Pokémon.
* **Usage:** In the context of *Pokémon XD*, Shadow moves are uniquely **Super Effective** against all non-Shadow Pokémon. While Shadow End boasts immense power comparable to *Double-Edge* or *Brave Bird*, its abysmal 60% accuracy makes it a "glass cannon" option. It is often passed over for the more reliable *Shadow Blitz* or the superior *Shadow Blast* (Special). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow** types.
* **Attributes:** Contact (The user physically strikes the opponent).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow distribution**, restricted exclusively to "Shadow Pokémon" encountered in the Orre Region. It cannot be learned by purified or standard Pokémon in the main series games.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Shadow Pokémon in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness* include **Shadow Lugia** (as its secondary physical option), **Shadow Snorlax**, and **Shadow Salamence**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Since Shadow moves hit every type for super effective damage (except other Shadow Pokémon), it serves as an omni-coverage nuke, though the recoil and miss chance make it a desperate play against bulky walls.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is a temporary "fixed" move that is lost once a Pokémon undergoes the **Purification** process to regain its normal moveset and type.
