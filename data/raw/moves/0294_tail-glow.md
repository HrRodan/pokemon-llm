## Identity & Mechanics
**Tail Glow** is a status Bug-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy to emit a brilliant, rhythmic strobe of light from its tail. This intense radiance supercharges the user’s cognitive and mystical power, drastically increasing their offensive potential. This move is a premier **Setup** tool for Special sweepers.
* **Effect:** Raises the user's **Special Attack** stat by **three stages (+3)**. (Note: Prior to Generation V, this move raised Special Attack by only two stages).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **High-Value Setup** / **Wallbreaking Catalyst**.
* **Usage:** Tail Glow is arguably the most powerful setup move in the game for Special Attackers. While *Nasty Plot* provides a +2 boost (doubling damage), Tail Glow provides a +3 boost (2.5x damage), allowing a Pokémon to become an immediate threat after just one turn. It is used to bypass traditional defensive walls and initiate a sweep.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, non-damaging status move. Because it is **Bug-type**, it interacts with specific mechanics like *Prankster* (if used by Volbeat) but is generally not affected by type-based immunities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (3 total learners), making it one of the rarest and most coveted moves in the competitive circuit.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Manaphy:** The most iconic user. "Tail Glow Manaphy" is a legendary threat in higher tiers (Smogon OU/Uber), using its natural bulk to survive a hit while setting up a game-ending sweep.
    * **Xurkitree:** An Ultra Beast with a massive base Special Attack. Combined with Tail Glow, it becomes a terrifying **Nuke** capable of one-shotting almost any Pokémon that does not resist its attacks.
    * **Volbeat:** The original user from Generation III. While it lacks offensive presence, it can use the ability **Prankster** to use Tail Glow with priority and then utilize *Baton Pass* to transfer the massive +3 boost to a teammate.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme rarity, it is never found as a coverage option on non-native learners.
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor**. It is strictly a signature-style level-up move for its very limited pool of users.
