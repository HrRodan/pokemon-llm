## Identity & Mechanics
**Aqua Jet** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user envelops its body in a high-pressure stream of water and launches itself at the opponent like a torpedo at speeds that make it nearly invisible to the naked eye. This rapid aquatic lunge allows the user to strike with extreme velocity, effectively bypassing the normal turn order to land a hit before the target can react.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and possesses a **priority bracket of +1**. This allows the user to move before other Pokémon using moves with standard priority, regardless of their Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Priority Finisher** / **Revenge Killer**.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Aqua Jet is a staple in competitive play for picking off weakened threats, breaking **Focus Sashes**, or bypassing the Speed tier of "Glass Cannons." It is the Water-type equivalent of *Quick Attack*, but significantly more dangerous due to potential **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) and Rain weather boosts. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**; affected by *Protect*, *Mirror Move*, and abilities like *Dazzling* or *Queenly Majesty* which block priority.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (72 learners), primarily found among Physical attackers with aquatic themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely utilized by **Azumarill** (where it becomes a nuclear threat when paired with the *Huge Power* ability and *Belly Drum*), **Feraligatr**, and **Samurott (Hisuian)**.
* **Coverage & Technical Utility:** Frequently seen on **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike** and **Palafin-Hero** to ensure they can finish off faster opponents. It is also a key tool for **Dragonite** and **Kabutops** to mitigate their middling Speed stats.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up or as a frequent **Egg Move**; notably, it is rarely available as a TM, making its natural presence on a moveset a significant competitive trait.
