## Identity & Mechanics
**Mist Ball** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user creates a pressurized sphere of mist and downy feathers, launching it at the target to trigger a psychic explosion. This mist-based assault is designed to shroud the opponent, clouding their focus and dampening their offensive capabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a high probability of debilitating the target's offensive potential.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s **Special Attack** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Utility Debuff.
* **Usage:** Mist Ball serves as a powerful signature STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option that prioritizes longevity and defensive disruption. While its low PP is a significant drawback compared to the standard move *Psychic* (90 Power, 10% SpDef drop), the **50% proc rate** for a Special Attack drop makes it incredibly effective for winning "Special Attacker vs. Special Attacker" duels. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a **Ball/Bomb move**, meaning it is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the signature move of the Eon Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Latias** and **Mega Latias**. It reflects Latias's more defensive and supportive nature compared to Latios (who uses *Luster Purge*).
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its signature status, it is not found as coverage on non-Psychic types. It is used by Latias to check Special Wallbreakers like **Iron Valiant** or **Keldeo**, forcing them to switch out or face diminished damage output.
* **Acquisition:** Historically, this move is learned via leveling up; it is **not available as a TM or TR**, further limiting its presence in the competitive meta to teams featuring Latias.
