## Identity & Mechanics
**Calm Mind** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user centers their spirit and clears their thoughts, entering a state of heightened mental focus. By eliminating distractions and calming the mind, the user simultaneously sharpens their offensive psychic potential and bolsters their resilience against elemental and mental assaults.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Special Attack and Special Defense stats by one stage each (+1 SpA, +1 SpD).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Setup / Win Condition.
* **Usage:** Calm Mind is the gold standard for **Special Sweepers** and **Bulky Setup** Pokémon. Unlike *Nasty Plot*, which provides a faster offensive boost (+2 SpA), Calm Mind increases longevity, allowing the user to survive incoming Special attacks while slowly becoming an unstoppable **Wallbreaker**. It is frequently paired with recovery moves (like Recover or Soft-Boiled) to create a "win condition" where the Pokémon becomes impossible to KO from the Special side.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks (targets self). It is a non-contact, mental-based status move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (307 learners), being accessible to nearly every Psychic-type and many Fairy, Ghost, and Electric-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Alakazam**, **Gardevoir**, **Mewtwo**, and **Latios/Latias**, who use it to transition from fast attackers to overwhelming nukes. 
* **Bulky Setup Users:** It is a core component of "CroCune" (Bulky **Suicune** with Rest/Sleep Talk) and Magic Guard **Clefable**, who uses the Special Defense boosts to ignore common Special checks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Raikou** or **Keldeo** to allow them to break through dedicated Special walls like Blissey after several boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (TM04 in many gens) or **TR** (TR49), making it a staple of competitive team building across all generations since its debut in Hoenn.
