## Identity & Mechanics
**Forest's Curse** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user channels ancient, arboreal magic or spectral woodland spirits to place a botanical hex upon the foe. This infusion of forest energy permeates the target’s essence, forcibly adding the Grass type to their existing elemental composition.
* **Effect:** Adds the Grass type to the target's current type(s). This can result in a Pokémon having three types simultaneously (e.g., a Fire/Flying-type Charizard becomes Fire/Flying/Grass). The effect lasts until the target switches out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the type change).
* **Targeting:** Single selected target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Type-Manipulation Utility.
* **Usage:** Forest's Curse is a highly niche, strategic move used to manufacture weaknesses on an opponent. By adding the Grass type, the user makes the target vulnerable to **Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug** moves. It is often used in Double Battles to set up a partner's STAB attack, turning a neutral hit into a Super Effective one, or a Super Effective hit into a 4x "nuke." It is the Grass-type equivalent of the move *Trick-or-Treat*.
* **Type Matchups:** While it deals no direct damage, it forces the target to be **Super Effective** against **Water, Ground, and Rock** types while simultaneously inheriting the five standard Grass-type weaknesses.
* **Attributes:** This move is blocked by *Protect* and *Detect* but does not make contact. It fails if the target is already a Grass-type.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, functioning as a signature move for a specific evolutionary line (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Trevenant** and its pre-evolution **Phantump**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its exclusive nature, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. In competitive play, Trevenant occasionally uses it to capitalize on its own Ghost-type STAB or to assist teammates in specialized "Gimmick" teams.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned strictly through Level Up by the Phantump line.
