## Identity & Mechanics
**Round** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).

* **Description:** The user emits a rhythmic vocal attack that resonates with the voices of allies. This musical performance creates a synchronized soundwave; if multiple Pokémon use this move in a single turn, they harmonize to increase the volume and intensity, overwhelming the target with a cumulative wall of sound.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. If another Pokémon has already used Round during the same turn, the power of this move is doubled from 60 to **120**. Furthermore, once the first Round is initiated, any other Pokémon selected to use Round will immediately follow the first user, ignoring their natural Speed tiers or priority brackets.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Teamwork-Dependent Nuke / Speed-Control Tech.
* **Usage:** While underwhelming in Singles, Round is a niche "gimmick" strategy in Double Battles. A fast Pokémon (the "Lead Singer") can trigger the first Round, allowing a slower, high-Special Attack partner to immediately follow up with a 120-BP hit, effectively bypassing the slower Pokémon's Speed deficit. It is often compared to **Hyper Voice**, which is generally preferred for its spread damage and higher base power without requiring setup.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **Resisted** by Rock and Steel, and has **No Effect** on Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based move**, meaning it bypasses the move **Substitute** but is completely negated by Pokémon with the **Soundproof** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive, near-universal distribution (**1,068 learners**), as it was a standard TM (TM48 in many regions) for several generations.

* **Prominent Users:** Iconic sound-themed Pokémon such as **Meloetta**, **Exploud**, **Primarina**, **Toxtricity**, and **Sylveon** frequently have access to it.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for coverage due to its Normal typing, it is occasionally seen on **Porygon-Z** or **Mega Gardevoir** (utilizing Pixilate to convert it to Fairy-type) in specialized doubles compositions. 
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common; it has been available via **TM or TR** in every mainline game from Pokémon Black & White through Pokémon Sword & Shield.
