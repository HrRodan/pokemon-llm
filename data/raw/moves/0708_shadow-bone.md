## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Bone** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user violently beats the target with a bone imbued with a lingering, vengeful spirit. This spectral strike channels the supernatural energy of the afterlife into a physical blow, often visualized as a bone wreathed in ghostly, eerie flames. The spiritual residue left behind weakens the opponent's physical fortitude.
* **Effect:** Inflicts direct physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to lower the target’s Defense by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Shadow Bone serves as the gold standard for Physical Ghost-type STAB for its users. It is preferred over *Phantom Force* because it deals damage in a single turn, providing immediate pressure. While *Poltergeist* (Gen 8+) offers higher raw power, Shadow Bone remains more reliable as it does not require the opponent to hold an item and has a beneficial secondary effect. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (2 learners), functioning as a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Alolan Marowak** and **Totem Alolan Marowak**. When paired with the **Thick Club** item, this move becomes a terrifying "Nuke," capable of 2HKOing many neutral threats in competitive tiers like UU or RU.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusivity, it is not used as a coverage option by other types. For Alolan Marowak, it provides a reliable way to bypass Physical walls; if the 20% Defense drop procs, very few Pokémon can switch in safely.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or HM. It is a natural level-up move or accessible via the Move Reminder for the Marowak-Alola line.
