## Identity & Mechanics
**Baby-Doll Eyes** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user gazes at the target with endearing, wide-eyed innocence, momentarily disarming their competitive spirit. This adorable distraction causes the opponent to hesitate, effectively lowering their physical damage output. Because of its charm, the move is executed with high speed, often catching the opponent off-guard before they can strike.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s **Attack stat by one stage**. Unlike standard stat-lowering moves, Baby-Doll Eyes possesses a **+1 Priority bracket**, allowing it to execute before most standard attacks.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the debuff unless the move misses or is blocked).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** **Priority Utility / Reactive Debuff.**
* **Usage:** While its effect is identical to *Growl*, its **+1 Priority** makes it significantly more viable in competitive play. It is primarily used as a "clutch" survival tool; a Pokémon can use it to weaken a faster Physical Sweeper (like Garchomp or Zacian) immediately before being hit, potentially turning an OHKO (One-Hit Knock Out) into a 2HKO. It is a direct rival to *Charm* (-2 Attack), which offers a stronger debuff but lacks the priority needed to outpace faster threats.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Fairy-type** move, but as a status move, it does not deal damage or benefit from type-effectiveness multipliers. It is notably effective against Pokémon with the *Defiant* or *Competitive* abilities only if the user intends to bait a stat boost (otherwise, it backfires). It is blocked by *Substitute* and the *Good as Gold* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (72 learners), primarily found among Pokémon categorized as "cute," mammalian, or Fairy-type.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly iconic on **Sylveon** and the other **Eeveelutions** (Vaporeon, Jolteon, etc.), **Clefable**, and **Tinkaton**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon)** and **Stoutland** as a niche way to mitigate physical pressure. In earlier generations, it was a mechanical requirement for Eevee to evolve into Sylveon.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up; it is notably absent from TM/TR lists in most generations, making it a specialized part of a Pokémon's natural move pool.
