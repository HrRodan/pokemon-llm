## Identity & Mechanics
**Worry Seed** is a status-class Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user plants a distressing, fast-growing seed on the target that induces a state of persistent anxiety and restlessness. This mental burden prevents the target from falling asleep or finding peace, mechanically replacing their innate biological or mystical traits with the Insomnia ability.
* **Effect:** Changes the target’s Ability to **Insomnia**. This effect lasts until the target switches out or the battle ends. The move fails if the target already has the Insomnia ability or possesses specific "hard-coded" abilities that cannot be overwritten, such as *Truant*, *Multitype*, *Stance Change*, *Schooling*, *Comatose*, *Shields Down*, *RKS System*, or *Battle Bond*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the ability change upon hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Utility / Ability Disruptor.**
* **Usage:** Worry Seed is a niche but potent tool for neutralizing Pokémon that rely heavily on their abilities to function. It is a hard counter to **Rest-Talk** strategies (as Insomnia prevents the use of Rest) and "nuke" abilities like **Huge Power**, **Pure Power**, or **Libro/Protean**. In Doubles, it can be used on an ally to prevent them from being put to sleep by *Spore* or *Sleep Powder*. It is often compared to *Gastro Acid* (which nullifies abilities) or *Skill Swap*, but Worry Seed is unique because it forces a specific, often useless ability onto the foe. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Grass-type status move, it deals no damage but is notably **blocked by Pokémon with the Overcoat ability**, **Grass-type Pokémon** (as of Gen VI), and targets holding a **Safety Goggles** item.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; reflected by *Magic Coat* and *Magic Bounce*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution among Grass-types (125 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Whimsicott** (who can use it with +1 Priority via *Prankster*), **Venusaur**, **Amoonguss**, and **Serperior**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-standard Grass-types or dual-types like **Nihilego** and **Mew**, who use it as a "tech" choice to cripple defensive walls that rely on *Regenerator* (like Toxapex or Slowbro).
* **Acquisition:** While it is rarely a TM/TR, it is a staple **Move Tutor** offering in games like *Platinum*, *HeartGold/SoulSilver*, and the *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon* eras, and frequently appears as an **Egg Move** for many Grass-type starters.
