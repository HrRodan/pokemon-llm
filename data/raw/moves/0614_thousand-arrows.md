## Identity & Mechanics
**Thousand Arrows** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user manifests a relentless barrage of shimmering, emerald-energy arrows that rain down from the sky to pierce all foes on the battlefield. This move is unique among Ground-type attacks for its ability to reach high-altitude targets, physically dragging them down to the earth and stripping away their aerial immunity.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and "Grounds" the target. It successfully hits Pokémon that are Flying-type, possess the Levitate ability, or are under the effects of Magnet Rise or Telekinesis. Once hit, the target is knocked to the ground and remains vulnerable to all Ground-type moves (and hazards like Spikes) until they switch out.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Ground the target upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** All adjacent opponents (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Meta Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Thousand Arrows is widely considered one of the most "spammable" and broken moves in competitive Pokémon history. Unlike Earthquake, which is blanked by Flying-types, Thousand Arrows has **zero natural immunities**. It allows the user to click a single Ground-type move without fear of the opponent safely switching in a Flying-type or Levitator. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types, and hits Flying-types for neutral damage while removing their immunity for subsequent turns.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move, meaning it bypasses effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin. In Double Battles, it hits both opponents with a 25% damage reduction.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (5 specific forms of a single Legendary Pokémon).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Zygarde** (including its 10% Forme, 50% Forme, and the massive Complete Forme).
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a Signature Move, it is the cornerstone of every Zygarde set. It allows Zygarde to run defensive "Sub-Coil" or "Dragon Dance" sets with only one attacking move, freeing up three slots for utility or setup because no Pokémon in the game is immune to its STAB.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM or TR. In most games, it is taught to Zygarde via the Zygarde Cube or a special Move Tutor, reflecting its status as a legendary power.
