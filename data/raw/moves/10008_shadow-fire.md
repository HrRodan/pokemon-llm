## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Fire** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically appearing in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a torrent of corrupted, dark flames fueled by a closed heart. Unlike standard fire, this shadow energy manifests as a purple-black blaze that seeks out and sears any opponent that is not a fellow Shadow Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage to a single target. It is one of the "elemental" Shadow moves designed to mirror traditional Pokémon attacks while retaining the unique properties of the Shadow type.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to Burn the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (N/A).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB (Shadow) / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, Shadow Fire serves as a mid-tier reliable damage source. Because Shadow-type moves are **Super Effective** against all non-Shadow Pokémon in *XD*, it functions as a universal nuke with perfect accuracy. It is often compared to *Shadow Bolt* and *Shadow Chill*, forming a trio of elemental shadow coverage. 
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow** types and is **not very effective** against other **Shadow** Pokémon.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is unaffected by most standard fire-related abilities (like Flash Fire) because it is technically Shadow-type, not Fire-type.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, limited exclusively to Shadow Pokémon encountered in the Orre Region during the events of *Pokémon XD*.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably utilized by **Shadow Moltres**, **Shadow Magmar**, and **Shadow Houndoom**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move is essentially "typeless" in its effectiveness against the standard roster, it is the primary tool for Shadow-type Special Attackers to break through defensive walls like Shuckle or Blissey during the main story of *XD*.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be learned via TM, TR, or Breeding. It is hard-coded into the movesets of specific Shadow Pokémon until they undergo **Purification**, at which point the move is replaced by a standard Fire-type move (typically *Flamethrower* or *Fire Blast*).
