## Identity & Mechanics
**Payback** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user bides its time, absorbing the opponent's momentum to launch a devastating retaliatory strike. This move is designed for reactive combat; by waiting for the target to commit to an action or attempt to retreat, the user finds a critical opening to strike with doubled force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target has already moved or switched out during the current turn, the base power of this move is doubled from 50 to 100. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power amplification is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (100 if moving second), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Reactive Wallbreaker** / **Low-Speed STAB**.
* **Usage:** Payback is a specialized tool for "bulky" or slow Pokémon. In a metagame where high speed is usually king, Payback rewards Pokémon with low Speed stats, allowing them to hit harder than they would with **Crunch** (80 Power) or **Night Slash** (70 Power). It is often preferred over **Knock Off** in specific defensive sets where raw damage against a moving target is more valued than item removal. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a contact move; it is affected by King's Rock and triggers abilities like Iron Barbs or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very wide** distribution (350+ learners), making it one of the most accessible Dark-type coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on bulky Dark-types and slow tanks such as **Umbreon**, **Tyranitar**, and **Mabosstiff**, who can reliably guarantee moving second to trigger the power boost.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Physical bruisers like **Machamp**, **Conkeldurr**, and **Ferrothorn** to punish Ghost-type switch-ins or to hit Psychic-type threats like Reuniclus or Slowbro.
* **Acquisition:** It has been a staple **TM (TM66)** or **TR (TR37)** across almost every generation since its debut in Sinnoh, ensuring most Physical attackers have access to it.
