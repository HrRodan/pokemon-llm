## Identity & Mechanics
**Soak** is a Status Water-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user douses the opponent in a pressurized, saturating torrent of water, completely masking their original elemental identity. This thematic "drenching" causes the target to lose its natural resistances and types, effectively becoming a pure Water-type Pokémon. This is a powerful tool for identity-erasure in tactical play.
* **Effect:** Changes the target's type to pure **Water**. This effect persists until the target leaves the field. The move fails if used against a Pokémon with the *Multitype* or *RKS System* abilities (like Arceus or Silvally).
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Status Move).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Tactical Utility / Setup Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Soak is primarily used to strip an opponent of their **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** and to force new weaknesses onto them. By turning a foe into a Water-type, they become immediately vulnerable to **Electric** and **Grass** attacks. It is famously used in "Catching" builds to allow *False Swipe* to hit Ghost-types or to allow *Spore* to affect Grass-types. In doubles, it can be paired with a partner holding a Choice Band or Specs to "force" a super-effective matchup against a wall.
* **Type Matchups:** While the move itself deals no damage, it forces the target to become weak to **Electric** and **Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Type-based immunities" once the type is changed (e.g., a Steel-type can be poisoned after being Soaked).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), almost exclusively restricted to Water-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Pelipper**, **Tapu Fini**, and **Dondozo**. These Pokémon use it to disrupt defensive cores or, in Pelipper's case, to enable powerful Thunder or Hurricane strikes.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on defensive stalwarts like **Pyukumuku** and **Alomomola**. These users utilize Soak to allow them to hit Steel or Poison-types with *Toxic*, which would otherwise be impossible.
* **Acquisition:** Limited primarily to natural level-up or Egg Moves; it is notably **not available via TM/TR** in most generations, making its distribution narrow and specialized.
