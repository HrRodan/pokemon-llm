## Identity & Mechanics
**Mach Punch** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user throws a blindingly fast punch from a distance, moving with such speed that it strikes before the target can react. This maneuver relies on momentum and specialized martial arts technique rather than raw brute force, allowing the user to bypass the standard speed order to land a blow.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and always moves first within its priority bracket (+1 Priority). It will strike before moves with lower priority, regardless of the Pokémon's actual Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** **Priority Finisher** / **Revenge Killer**.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Mach Punch is invaluable for picking off weakened, faster opponents or frail sweepers. It is frequently compared to *Vacuum Wave* (the Special equivalent) and *Bullet Punch*. It is a mandatory choice on Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (boosting it to 60 BP) or the **Iron Fist** ability (boosting it by 20%). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Punching move**, meaning it is boosted by the Iron Fist ability and interacts with items like Protective Pads or Rocky Helmet upon **Contact**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (21 learners), primarily concentrated among humanoid Fighting-types and certain Fire-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Breloom** (where it becomes devastatingly powerful thanks to the *Technician* ability), **Conkeldurr** (often utilizing *Iron Fist* for a boosted STAB priority), and **Infernape** (providing essential speed control).
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Magmortar** or **Lucario** to provide physical priority or to surprise Dark-type threats like Weavile or Roaring Moon. 
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via level-up or as an **Egg Move**; it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its presence on a team highly predictable based on the Pokémon's species.
