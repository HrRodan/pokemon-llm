## Identity & Mechanics
**Freezing Glare** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental energy into a piercing stare, projecting a beam of chilling psychic power from its eyes. This move is the signature attack of Galarian Articuno, visually representing the transition of the Articuno lineage from Ice-type mastery to psychic prowess while retaining a "cold" thematic element.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent special damage to a single target. It is notable for its rare secondary effect, being one of the few Psychic-type moves that can manipulate the "frozen" status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Freeze** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / Signature Special Attacker.
* **Usage:** Freezing Glare is the primary offensive tool for Galarian Articuno. In terms of raw power and consistency, it is a direct rival to the standard move **Psychic**. While *Psychic* offers a 10% chance to lower Special Defense, Freezing Glare offers a 10% chance to **Freeze**, which is often considered more impactful in a competitive setting as freezing effectively removes a Pokémon from play until they thaw. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, beam-like move. Despite the flavor text mentioning eyes, it is not categorized as a "Gaze" move that can be blocked by certain abilities like *Inner Focus* (which only blocks flinching) or *Mirror Coat* (which reflects it).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Galarian Articuno**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is exclusive to a single Legendary Pokémon, it does not see play as a coverage option on other archetypes. It defines Galarian Articuno’s offensive presence, allowing it to threaten Poison-types like **Toxapex** or Fighting-types like **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike** with high-accuracy, high-reward STAB damage.
* **Acquisition:** This move is learned upon evolution or at a high level by Galarian Articuno; it is **not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor** for any other Pokémon.
