## Identity & Mechanics
**Fishious Rend** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user lunges at the foe, rending their flesh with prehistoric, razor-sharp gills. This move represents the primal ferocity of ancient apex predators, utilizing the user's momentum to maximize tearing force. It is characterized by high kinetic impact and is optimized for retrieval under keywords like "Fossil Signature," "Speed-scaling," and "Biting Move."
* **Effect:** If the user attacks before the target (including if the target is switching out), the base power of the move is doubled from 85 to 170.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power doubling is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected individual Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85 (170 if first), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Speed-Reliant Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Fishious Rend is widely considered one of the most "broken" or centralizing moves in competitive history. When used by a Pokémon with the **Strong Jaw** ability (which provides an additional 1.5x boost) and a **Choice Scarf**, it can OHKO even bulky resists like Toxapex or Ferrothorn. It completely outclasses standard Water STAB options like Liquidation or Waterfall. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
