## Identity & Mechanics
**Trump Card** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user focuses its remaining energy into a final, tactical strike that grows in desperation and force as the user's stamina depletes. This move is a "final gambit" style attack where the user exhausts its technical capacity to unleash a devastating burst of power. Because it is a calculated strike, it never misses the target, bypassing all evasion and accuracy checks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the remaining PP of the move *after* the PP for the current turn is deducted. The power increases as PP decreases: 4+ PP (40 Power), 3 PP (50 Power), 2 PP (60 Power), 1 PP (80 Power), and 0 PP (200 Power).
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but it possesses a **Never-Miss** mechanic (ignores accuracy/evasion modifiers).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [—]%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Tactical Nuke / Last Resort.
* **Usage:** Trump Card is a niche gimmick move that requires careful PP management to be effective. Its primary draw is the **200 Power** hit on its final usage, which matches the raw power of *Explosion* or *Self-Destruct* without the drawback of fainting, and benefits from being a Special attack. However, its low initial power (40-60) makes the user vulnerable while "priming" the move. It deals **neutral damage** to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; considered a Special attack, making it unique among high-power Normal-type moves which are typically Physical.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (12 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously associated with **Eevee**, which often uses it as a flavor-thematic "hidden ace." It is also utilized by the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna** and the tactical **Slowking**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Dunsparce** or **Oshawott** during playthroughs as a high-power option for finishing long battles.
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is not a TM/TR move and is primarily learned through level-up by a select group of Pokémon, making it a rare sight in standard competitive tiers.
