## Identity & Mechanics
**Refresh** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy to revitalize its body and purge debilitating ailments. This cleansing process allows the user to shake off restrictive or damaging conditions that would otherwise hinder its combat performance.
* **Effect:** The move removes **Burn**, **Paralysis**, or **Poison** (including Bad Poison/Toxic) from the user. It does not affect Sleep or Freeze.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Defensive Sustain.
* **Usage:** Refresh is a niche but effective tool for defensive walls and setup sweepers to bypass **Passive Damage** and speed reduction. While it lacks the team-wide utility of *Heal Bell* or *Aromatherapy*, its high PP and specific distribution make it a strong choice for Pokémon that need to outlast "Toxic stalling." It ensures that a physical attacker remains unhindered by the Attack drop of a Burn, and that a speed-reliant Pokémon is not crippled by Paralysis.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect/Detect**, reflected by **Magic Coat**, and is blocked by **Taunt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (35 learners), primarily concentrated among bulky Normal, Water, and Psychic-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by defensive staples such as **Blissey**, **Milotic**, and the Legendary Eon duo, **Latias** and **Latios**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Altaria** (especially its Mega Evolution) to prevent status from cutting short a *Dragon Dance* sweep. It is also a rare utility option for **Tapu Fini** in specific formats to maintain longevity.
* **Acquisition:** Refresh is generally not available via TM or TR; it is primarily learned through level-up or as an Egg Move, making its presence on a moveset a deliberate teambuilding choice to counter stall-oriented strategies.
