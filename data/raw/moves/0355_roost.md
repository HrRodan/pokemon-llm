## Identity & Mechanics
**Roost** is a Status Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user temporarily descends from the sky to the ground, perching to rest its wings and restore its vitality. This restorative action heals the user for up to 50% of its maximum HP. By physically landing, the user sheds its airborne vulnerabilities—and its aerial advantages—briefly becoming grounded.
* **Effect:** Restores 50% of the user's maximum HP. A unique mechanical quirk of Roost is that if the user is a **Flying-type**, it loses its Flying typing for the remainder of the turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Self-targeted healing).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Recovery / Sustainability / Utility.
* **Usage:** Roost is the gold standard for longevity for Flying-types and various dragonoids. Unlike *Recover*, Roost carries a strategic defensive utility: by losing the Flying type for one turn, a Pokémon can potentially survive a predicted Super Effective **Electric, Ice, or Rock** attack. Conversely, the user becomes susceptible to **Ground-type** moves (like Earthquake) during that window. It is the cornerstone move for "Stall" and "Bulky Offense" archetypes.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (153 learners), making it one of the most accessible recovery moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Essential for defensive stalwarts like **Corviknight**, **Skarmory**, and **Gliscor**, who rely on it to wall opponents. It is also a staple on legendary birds such as **Zapdos** and **Moltres**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on powerful offensive Dragon-types like **Dragonite**, **Salamence**, and **Roaring Moon** to provide them with the staying power needed to set up multiple *Dragon Dances*. It is also a rare recovery option for non-Flying types like **Hydreigon** and **Flygon**.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM (Technical Machine)** in almost every generation since its debut, though its PP was significantly reduced in Generation IX to limit stall tactics.
