## Identity & Mechanics
**Sandstorm** is a Status Rock-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user summons a fierce, swirling whirlwind of grit and sand that envelops the entire battlefield for five turns. This shifting desert environment obscures vision and scours the skin of any combatant not adapted to harsh arid climates. In a competitive RAG context, this move is the foundation for "Sand Teams," providing both residual chip damage and significant defensive stat modifiers.
* **Effect:** Changes the battlefield weather to a Sandstorm for 5 turns (extended to 8 turns if the user holds a **Smooth Rock**). 
    * **Damage:** All Pokémon that are not **Rock, Ground, or Steel** type take 1/16th of their maximum HP in residual damage at the end of every turn.
    * **Buffs:** The Special Defense of all **Rock-type** Pokémon is increased by 50%.
    * **Synergy/Interactions:** Reduces the healing of *Morning Sun*, *Synthesis*, and *Moonlight* to 25%. Halves the base power of *Solar Beam* and *Solar Blade*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Field Effect).
* **Targeting:** Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Field Control / Weather Setter.
* **Usage:** While often set automatically via the Ability **Sand Stream**, the manual move is used on dedicated weather teams to override opposing Rain, Sun, or Snow. It is a cornerstone of "Stall" and "Balance" archetypes, using passive chip damage to break **Focus Sashes** and wear down "Wall" Pokémon. It provides a massive defensive spike to Rock-types, allowing them to tank Special Attacks that would otherwise OHKO them.
* **Type Matchups:** Deals residual damage to all types except **Rock, Ground, and Steel**. It is particularly effective at neutralizing **Fire, Grass, and Fairy** types that rely on weather-based healing or solar-based attacks.
* **Attributes:** Weather-modifying move; bypassed by Pokémon with the *Overcoat* or *Magic Guard* abilities and those holding *Safety Goggles*.

* **Coverage/Utility:** Frequently seen on fast leads like **Aerodactyl** or **Lycanroc** to disrupt opposing strategies or on defensive pivots like **Regirock** to maximize their Special Defense.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in nearly every generation since its debut.
