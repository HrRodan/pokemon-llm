## Identity & Mechanics
**Knock Off** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user delivers a jarring strike or slap intended to disarm the target, forcibly knocking their held item to the ground and rendering it unusable for the remainder of the battle. This move is tactically vital for dismantling strategies reliant on specific held items like Choice Scarf, Eviolite, or Leftovers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and removes the target's held item. Since Generation VI, this move deals **1.5x damage** (approx. 97.5 base power) if the target is holding a removable item. The item cannot be recovered via the move *Recycle*.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to remove the held item (unless the target has the *Sticky Hold* ability or the item is protected, such as Mega Stones, Z-Crystals, or Orbs on certain Legendaries).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65 (97.5 with item boost), Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Premier Utility/Wallbreaker and Disruption.
* **Usage:** Widely considered one of the best moves in competitive Pokémon history. It serves as a "progress maker" by permanently weakening defensive threats (e.g., removing **Heavy-Duty Boots** or **Eviolite**) and punishing switch-ins. Unlike *Crunch* (80 BP), Knock Off provides higher immediate damage on the first hit and massive utility. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (**370 learners**), making it a staple across various team archetypes.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Bisharp / Kingambit**, **Weavile**, **Roaring Moon**, and **Meowscarada**.
* **Coverage/Utility Users:** Frequently equipped by non-Dark types for its sheer utility, such as **Landorus-Therian**, **Rillaboom**, **Toxapex**, and **Gliscor** to cripple counters on the switch.
* **Acquisition:** It has historically been a highly sought-after **Move Tutor** move and is available as a **TM** in more recent iterations like *Scarlet & Violet*.
