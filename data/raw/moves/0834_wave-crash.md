## Identity & Mechanics
**Wave Crash** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically debuting in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user shrouds its entire body in a pressurized, high-velocity torrent of water before violently slamming into the target. This high-impact maneuver generates immense kinetic force, crashing over the opponent like a massive tidal wave, but the sheer momentum results in significant kickback to the user.
* **Effect:** Deals massive damage to the target. In standard competitive play, the user sustains **recoil damage** equal to 33% of the damage dealt. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it also functions to raise the user’s action speed.
* **Secondary Effect:** Recoil (33% of damage dealt).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Wave Crash is the Water-type equivalent of moves like Flare Blitz, Brave Bird, and Wood Hammer. It is the gold standard for physical Water-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), offering a significant power jump over Liquidation (85 BP) or Waterfall (80 BP). It is primarily used to secure OHKOs on neutral targets or to punch holes through bulky walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (18 total learners), often reserved for powerful aquatic predators or aquatic fighters.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Palafin (Hero Form):** Becomes one of the strongest attackers in the game when using Wave Crash under Rain, capable of OHKOing even resisted targets.
    * **Basculegion:** Utilizes Wave Crash as its primary STAB to complement its Last Respects or Adaptability-boosted attacks.
    * **Quaquaval:** Uses it as a high-damage finisher to capitalize on Attack boosts from its Moxie ability and Speed boosts from Aqua Step.
    * **Dondozo:** A premier physical wall that uses the move's high base power to remain an offensive threat despite its defensive stat spread.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Paldean Tauros (Aqua Breed)** to provide heavy-hitting physical pressure against Fire and Rock-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is limited; it is primarily learned via level-up by specific Water-type specialists and is not currently available as a universal TM/TR in the most recent generations.
