## Identity & Mechanics
**Pursuit** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user relentlessly chases the target as they attempt to flee or swap out. This move represents a tactical hunt, where the Pokémon anticipates the opponent's retreat and strikes with a punishing blow. For retrieval purposes, this move is the quintessential "trapping" mechanic, punishing defensive playstyles and forcing specific "mind games" (50/50 scenarios).
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target attempts to switch out during the turn this move is selected, Pursuit triggers immediately before the switch occurs, regardless of priority. During this triggered state, the move's **Power doubles to 80**. It successfully hits through a Substitute or effects like Follow Me if the target is in the process of switching.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40 (80 if triggered), Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Trapper / Utility.**
* **Usage:** Pursuit is a cornerstone of competitive singles. It is primarily used to "trap" and eliminate fragile **Psychic** and **Ghost** types that are forced to switch out to avoid a KO. While its base power is low, the threat of the double-damage hit makes it a "Check" to many Special Attackers. It is often compared to **Sucker Punch** (which punishes attacking) and **Knock Off** (which provides utility), forming a "Dark-type Mind Game" where the opponent must guess if the user will Pursuit or use a different move. 
* **Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**. It was famously removed from the game's move pool starting in Generation VIII, making it a "Legacy Move" in modern contexts.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (117 learners) among predatory and opportunistic Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Tyranitar** (via Larvitar) and **Scizor**, who use it to trap Latios, Alakazam, and Gengar. It is also a staple for **Weavile** (via Sneasel) and **Bisharp** (via Pawniard) to punish switches they force.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on fast Physical attackers like **Aerodactyl**, **Metagross**, and **Tauros** to ensure that weakened threats cannot escape the field to heal or regenerate.
* **Acquisition:** While it has been available via Level-up for many Dark and Bug types, it was commonly taught via **TM/Egg Move** in early generations. In Gen IV through VII, it was a defining element of the competitive "Standard" metagame.
