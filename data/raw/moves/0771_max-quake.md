## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Quake** is a Physical Ground-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A monumental tectonic shift triggered by a Dynamaxed Pokémon that causes the earth to rupture and surge toward the target. This massive release of seismic energy creates a protective resonance that bolsters the special resilience of the user and its allies, manifesting as an increase in Special Defense.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the power of the move it was transformed from. Upon successful hit, it raises the Special Defense of the user and its allies by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the Special Defense of the user and its teammates.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target), though the secondary effect benefits the entire side of the field in Double Battles.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales: 90–140], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Stat-Buffing Nuke / Special Bulk Setup.**
* **Usage:** Max Quake is a cornerstone of Dynamax strategy in the VGC (Double Battles) and Generation VIII Smogon (Single Battles) formats. Unlike its counterpart *Max Steelspike* (which raises Defense), Max Quake allows physical attackers to survive incoming Special attacks from threats like Kyogre or Calyrex-Shadow. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types, making it one of the most valuable offensive coverage types in the game.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; Power is determined by the base move (e.g., Earthquake becomes a 130 BP Max Quake, while Scorching Sands becomes a Special-based Max Quake).

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Max Move, it is not "learned" directly but is accessible to any Pokémon that knows a Ground-type move while it is Dynamaxed.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Landorus-Therian**, **Garchomp**, and **Groudon** to punish Steel and Rock types while simultaneously becoming harder to revenge-kill with Special attacks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Gyarados**, **Tyranitar**, or **Dragonite** via Earthquake to break through Steel-type checks (like Zacian-C) and provide much-needed Special Defense boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Dynamax-exclusive mechanic; available to any Pokémon with a Ground-type movepool (TM/TR/Egg Moves) in Pokémon Sword and Shield.
