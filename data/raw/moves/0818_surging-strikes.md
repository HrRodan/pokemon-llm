## Identity & Mechanics
**Surging Strikes** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user manifests the pinnacle of the "Rapid Strike Style," unleashing a fluid, rhythmic sequence of three devastating blows. This relentless torrent of water mimics the unstoppable flow of a river, crashing into the target with such precision that every strike finds a vital opening.
* **Effect:** The move strikes the target **three times** in a single turn. Each of the three hits is **guaranteed to be a Critical Hit**, unless the target is protected by abilities like Shell Armor or Battle Armor.
* **Secondary Effect:** Always results in a critical hit (100% crit rate). Because it is a multi-hit move, it effectively bypasses **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, and **Substitute**.
* **Targeting:** Single Enemy.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (per hit), Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Multi-hit Wallbreaker / Setup-Punisher.
* **Usage:** While its base power appears low (75 total), the guaranteed critical hit multiplier (1.5x) raises its effective power to **112.5**, before factoring in STAB. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to **ignore the target's Defense boosts** and the **user's Attack drops** (such as from Intimidate). It is the premier tool for Punishing "Iron Defense" or "Cosmic Power" stalling. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes Contact; Multi-hit move; Affected by King's Rock (three chances to flinch).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of a specific Forme.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Urshifu (Rapid Strike Style)**. It is the defining move of this Pokémon, distinguishing it from its Single Strike counterpart.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can learn this move via Sketch or Mimic in standard competitive formats, making it a unique identifier for Urshifu-RS. It allows Urshifu to pressure defensive staples like **Garganacl** and **Great Tusk** with relentless, un-resisted damage.
* **Acquisition:** This is a signature move learned upon evolution/interaction with the Scroll of Waters in the Isle of Armor; it is **not available** via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to any other species.
