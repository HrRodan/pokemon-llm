## Identity & Mechanics
**Bulldoze** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user violently stomps the ground, sending out a localized shockwave that ripples through the battlefield. This seismic disturbance causes the earth to shift and buckle, physically hindering all nearby opponents and forcing them to navigate unstable terrain, effectively slowing their movement.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to the target. It is a guaranteed form of Speed control, as it has a 100% chance to lower the target's Speed stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Speed.
* **Targeting:** In Double Battles, it targets **all adjacent Pokémon** (including allies).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Utility / Speed Control**. While its base power is low, its utility as a reliable method to manipulate Speed tiers makes it a niche but effective tactical choice.
* **Usage:** Bulldoze is frequently compared to **Earthquake**. While Earthquake is the preferred "High-Power Nuke" for Ground types, Bulldoze is chosen when the player prioritizes **Speed Control** over raw damage. It is particularly valuable in the VGC (Doubles) format to slow down faster threats, though players must be careful as it also hits their partner unless they are Flying-type or have the Levitate ability. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; does not trigger abilities like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet. It is a "ground-based" move that fails against Flying-type Pokémon or those with Levitate.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (446 learners), making it one of the most accessible Ground-type coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) users include **Garchomp**, **Mamoswine**, **Great Tusk**, and **Hippowdon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy Physical attackers like **Tyranitar**, **Incineroar**, and **Metagross** to provide both Ground-type coverage and utility against faster offensive threats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in almost every generation since its debut, ensuring most Physical attackers can access it for their movepools.
