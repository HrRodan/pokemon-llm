## Identity & Mechanics
**Defense Curl** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user curls its body into a tight, protective ball, shielding its vital organs and softening its exterior to better absorb physical impact. This tactical bracing increases the Pokémon's physical bulk and streamlines its form for rolling-based momentum.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Defense stat by one stage (+1). Additionally, as long as the user remains active on the field, the base power of the moves **Rollout** and **Ice Ball** are doubled.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Stat self-buff).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 40 (Max 64).
* **Role:** Utility / Setup / Combo Piece.
* **Usage:** While outclassed in higher tiers by moves like *Iron Defense* or *Acid Armor* (which provide +2 Defense), Defense Curl remains a niche **Setup** tool in lower tiers (ZU/PU) or in specific "Rollout-core" strategies. Its primary value lies in the hidden multiplier: a Defense Curl-boosted Rollout starts at an effective 60 BP and can scale to devastating levels, turning the user into a **Wallbreaker** over successive turns. It is a vital tool for survivability against Physical attackers, helping the user withstand hits from **Fighting**, **Rock**, and **Ground** type threats.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; compatible with *Z-Moves* (raises Accuracy by 1 stage in addition to the Defense boost).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (214 learners), primarily given to Pokémon with round, armored, or flexible anatomies.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Golem**, **Sandslash**, and **Miltank** (notorious for the Defense Curl/Rollout combo in the Johto region). It is also core to **Shuckle's** defensive identity.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Chansey** or **Blissey** in older formats to mitigate their naturally low Physical Defense, or on **Scolipede** and **Great Tusk** as a filler move to increase longevity during a sweep.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available via **TM40** in Generation II and has remained a common Level-up or Egg Move for most "spherical" or "armored" Pokémon throughout every generation.
