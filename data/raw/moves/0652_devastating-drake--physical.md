## Identity & Mechanics
**Devastating Drake (Physical)** is a Physical Dragon-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user harnesses its Z-Power through a Dragonium Z crystal, materializing a colossal, draconic aura to strike the target with overwhelming physical force. This move manifests as a localized explosion of dragon energy, designed to bypass traditional defensive maneuvers through sheer scale and intensity.
* **Effect:** This is a transformed move. Its power is derived from the user's base physical Dragon-type move (such as Dragon Claw or Outrage). It acts as a one-time-use tactical nuke.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, like most Z-Moves, it **bypasses accuracy checks** and can hit through protective moves like Protect or Detect (dealing 25% of its original damage).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the Gen 7 competitive meta to eliminate specific threats that would otherwise survive a standard STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. Because it is a one-time-use ability, it is often reserved to "punch a hole" in the opponent's defensive core. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Context:** Compared to its base moves like *Outrage*, Devastating Drake is superior because it does not lock the user into the move for multiple turns and lacks the confusion drawback, while offering a significantly higher base power for a single turn.
* **Attributes:** Contact (depends on the base move, but generally considered physical contact), Z-Move mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn a physical Dragon-type move and hold the **Dragonium Z** crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Garchomp:** Often used Dragonium Z with *Dragon Claw* or *Outrage* to lure in and OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) defensive Landorus-T or opposing Dragon-types.
    * **Dragonite:** Utilized this to secure KOs after a *Dragon Dance* boost, ensuring its sweep wasn't ended by a sturdy physical wall.
    * **Haxorus:** Combined its massive Attack stat with this move to act as a premier **Wallbreaker**, capable of dismantling even the sturdiest neutral targets.
    * **Kommo-o:** While often associated with its signature Z-Move, it frequently utilized physical Dragonium Z sets to surprise opponents.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Charizard X** (Mega Evolution) or **Salamence** to provide a guaranteed, high-damage hit that ignores evasion or accuracy drops.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII by giving a Pokémon with a physical Dragon move the **Dragonium Z** crystal, obtained at the Vast Poni Canyon.
