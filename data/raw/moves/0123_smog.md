## Identity & Mechanics
**Smog** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user exhales or expels a thick, billowing cloud of noxious, filthy gases at the target. This industrial-strength pollution chokes the opponent with toxic fumes, potentially leaving them poisoned. It is often associated with waste-based organisms, volcanic entities, and mechanical Pokémon that emit exhaust.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a high probability of inducing the Poison status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 40% chance to **Poison** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30, Accuracy 70%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Early-game Status Inflictor / Flavor Move.
* **Usage:** Smog is generally considered unviable in competitive play due to its dangerously low accuracy and negligible base power. It is strictly outclassed by **Sludge Bomb**, which offers 90 Power, 100% Accuracy, and a 30% Poison chance. In the context of status spreading, **Toxic** is preferred for its "Badly Poisoned" (scaling damage) effect and higher accuracy. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. It is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof** in certain generations and has no effect on Steel-types or Pokémon with the **Immunity** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (34 learners), primarily concentrated among Poison, Fire, and Ghost types.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic to the **Koffing/Weezing** line and **Grimer/Muk**, representing living pollution. It is also a signature flavor move for the **Magmar** and **Torkoal** lines to represent volcanic soot.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally found on Fire-types like **Houndoom**, **Salazzle**, and **Chandelure**, as well as the Dragon-type **Turtonator**, though it is rarely chosen over more powerful STAB or coverage options.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is notably absent from the TM/TR lists of most modern generations, limiting its availability to natural learners.
