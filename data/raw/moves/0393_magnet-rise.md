## Identity & Mechanics
**Magnet Rise** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user generates a localized electromagnetic field to suspend itself in mid-air, effectively defying gravity for five turns. This creates a hovering state similar to the Levitate ability, allowing the Pokémon to float above the battlefield to avoid seismic tremors, mud-based attacks, and ground-entry hazards.
* **Effect:** For five turns, the user gains a total immunity to Ground-type moves. The move fails if the user is already under the effect of **Ingrain** or possesses the **Levitate** ability. The effect is temporarily suppressed by the move **Gravity** or if the user is hit by **Smack Down** or **Thousand Arrows**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The effect can be passed to a teammate via **Baton Pass**).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Anti-Meta Tech.
* **Usage:** Primarily used by Steel and Electric types to temporarily remove their most common and devastating weakness: Ground. Unlike an **Air Balloon**, which pops upon taking any damage, Magnet Rise provides a reliable 5-turn window of immunity that can be refreshed. It is particularly effective for "Choice-locking" opponents who expect to revenge kill with **Earthquake**. It also grants immunity to **Spikes** and **Toxic Spikes** for the duration.
* **Type Matchups:** Specifically designed to neutralize **Ground**-type threats. 
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact Status move; it can be reflected by **Magic Coat** or stolen by **Snatch**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (138 learners), appearing frequently across Electric, Steel, and Psychic types.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by **Magnezone**, **Metagross**, and **Probopass**—all of whom suffer from crippling Ground weaknesses. **Klefki** is a notable user due to the ability **Prankster**, which allows it to use Magnet Rise with priority, potentially dodging an incoming Earthquake before the opponent moves.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a "tech" choice on Pokémon like **Excadrill** (to win the mirror match against other Ground types) and **Volcarona**, which can use the immunity to set up Quiver Dances safely against defensive Ground types.
* **Acquisition:** While often not available as a standard TM, it has historically been a staple **Move Tutor** move across several generations (Sinnoh, Unova, Hoenn/ORAS, and Alola).
