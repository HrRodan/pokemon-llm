## Identity & Mechanics
**Head Charge** is a physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user lowers its head and delivers a devastating, high-speed ramming attack, utilizing its thick, protective guard hair to cushion the impact. This move represents a brutal head-on collision, often associated with the raw power of a stampeding buffalo.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant physical damage. However, the sheer force of the impact causes the user to sustain **recoil damage** equal to 1/4 (25%) of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **High-Power Wallbreaker** / **Signature STAB**.
* **Usage:** Functionally identical to the move *Double-Edge*, Head Charge serves as a high-reward, high-risk primary attacking option. Because it is a Normal-type move, it provides excellent neutral coverage against most of the Pokédex, though it deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, and **Ghost** types are completely immune.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is the **signature move** of the Bash Buffalo Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Bouffalant**. It is the cornerstone of Bouffalant’s offensive presence, particularly when paired with the ability **Reckless**, which increases the power of recoil-inducing moves by 20%, or **Sap Sipper** to provide a free Attack boost.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found as a coverage option on other Pokémon. In competitive tiers (like ZU or PU), a Reckless-boosted Head Charge is a terrifying "Nuke" capable of OHKOing many offensive threats that do not resist Normal-type attacks.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned by Bouffalant through leveling up.
