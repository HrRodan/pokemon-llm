## Identity & Mechanics
**Ice Shard** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user instantaneously flash-freezes moisture in the air to create jagged, crystalline slivers of ice, hurling them at the target with extreme velocity. This move is designed for speed over raw power, allowing the user to strike before the opponent can act. Its quick-fire nature makes it a staple for cold-climate predators and ice-elemental specialists.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and possesses a **Priority of +1**, meaning it will typically strike before other moves in the same turn unless the opponent also uses a priority move with higher speed or a higher priority bracket.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** **Priority Revenge Killer** / Finisher.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Ice Shard is a top-tier competitive tool because it exploits the 4x weakness many top-tier threats (like Dragon/Flying or Ground/Dragon types) have to Ice. It is primarily used to "check" faster threats such as **Garchomp**, **Dragonite**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Salamence**, picking them off once they are weakened. It bypasses the speed advantage of "Choice Scarf" users and "Dragon Dance" sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Ground, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range (non-contact), bypasses speed tiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (38 learners), primarily concentrated among Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) users include **Mamoswine**, **Weavile**, **Chien-Pao**, and **Baxcalibur**. For these Pokémon, Ice Shard is an essential tool to compensate for mid-tier speed or to secure KOs on faster opponents.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ice types like **Donphan** (via Phanpy) and **Inteleon**, providing them with vital priority to finish off targets that would otherwise outspeed them.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up or Egg Move. According to historical data, it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making it a specialized trait of specific evolutionary lines rather than a universal coverage option.
