## Identity & Mechanics
**Return** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** A powerful physical attack fueled by the emotional bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon. The user channels its loyalty and affection into a strike that grows more devastating as the Pokémon's Friendship (Happiness) level increases. Visually, it is often depicted as a focused, energetic lunge or strike radiating with a white or pink aura.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. Its base power is determined by the Pokémon's Friendship value, calculated by the formula `Friendship * 2 / 5`. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, at maximum Friendship (255), the move reaches a consistent Base Power of **102**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: Max 102], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** For generations, Return was the gold standard for Physical Normal-type STAB. It is preferred over *Body Slam* for raw damage (102 vs 85) and over *Double-Edge* for longevity, as it lacks recoil damage. It serves as a highly spammable "bread-and-butter" move for physical attackers who need a high-accuracy, reliable hit. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, but offers excellent neutral coverage against most of the Pokédex, being resisted only by **Rock** and **Steel**, and ignored by **Ghost**.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (942 learners), as it was historically a universal TM move (TM27) available to almost every Pokémon capable of learning moves.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Snorlax**, **Mega Kangaskhan** (where Parental Bond made it devastating), **Lopunny**, and **Tauros**.
* **Coverage Utility:** In earlier competitive eras, Physical Dragons and high-attack threats like **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, and **Salamence** utilized Return as a reliable neutral-coverage option when their primary STABs were resisted.
* **Acquisition:** Return was a staple TM (TM27) from Generation II through Generation VII. Notably, the move was **cut** from the data in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and has remained largely unavailable in standard play since, replaced by moves like *Facade* or *Double-Edge*.
