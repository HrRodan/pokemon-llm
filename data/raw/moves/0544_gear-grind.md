## Identity & Mechanics
**Gear Grind** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user launches a pair of high-speed, interlocking metallic gears at the target, which grind against the opponent to inflict damage. This mechanical assault is a multi-strike move that emphasizes the industrial nature of its users.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage twice in a single turn. Each hit has its own accuracy check and calculation for critical hits.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (effectively 0%), though its multi-hit nature allows it to bypass **Focus Sashes, Sturdy**, and **Substitutes**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (Per hit, Total 100), Accuracy 85%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Multi-hit STAB / Substitute Breaker.
* **Usage:** Gear Grind serves as a high-power but slightly unreliable STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option. While it matches the 100 Power of *Iron Tail*, it offers better accuracy (85% vs 75%) and the unique ability to break through **Multiscale** (Dragonite) or **Disguise** (Mimikyu) with the first hit, allowing the second hit to deal full damage. It is often compared to *Iron Head*; while Gear Grind lacks the flinch chance, its higher total base power and multi-hit utility make it the preferred choice for dedicated physical attackers that can access it.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Iron Barbs* twice.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (3 learners in its debut, expanding slightly in later generations).
* **Prominent Users:** Almost exclusively utilized by the **Klinklang** line (**Klink, Klang, and Klinklang**), serving as their signature offensive tool.
* **Coverage Utility:** Extremely rare on non-Steel types; however, it is notable as an Egg Move for **Toxtricity** (Amped Form) in Generation VIII, providing it with a niche physical option to punish Fairy-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Highly restricted; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor in most games, requiring level-up or specific breeding chains to obtain.
