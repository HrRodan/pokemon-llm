## Identity & Mechanics
**Nuzzle** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user approaches the target and rubs its electrified cheeks against them in a deceptively cute gesture. This friction generates a discharge that deals minor physical damage while guaranteed to overstimulate the target's nervous system. Because it is an attacking move rather than a status move, it carries the unique benefit of bypassing effects like **Taunt**.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage and has a guaranteed secondary effect.
* **Secondary Effect:** **100% chance** to inflict the **Paralysis** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Utility / Status Spreader.**
* **Usage:** Nuzzle is a superior alternative to *Thunder Wave* for the Pokémon that can learn it. While its damage is negligible, the fact that it is a damaging move means it cannot be blocked by **Taunt** or **Magic Coat**. It is primarily used to cripple fast sweepers by cutting their Speed by 50% and granting a 25% chance for them to be "fully paralyzed" each turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types, though its main purpose is the status rather than the HP reduction.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move; users must be wary of items like *Rocky Helmet* or abilities like *Rough Skin* and *Effect Spore*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (34 learners), almost exclusively limited to "Pikachu-clones" and rodent-like Electric types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Pikachu** and **Raichu**, but most famously utilized by **Pachirisu** (notably in its 2014 World Championship win) and **Togedemaru** for disruptive support.
* **Coverage Utility:** Modern Generation IX users like **Pawmot** use Nuzzle to force switches and create setup opportunities for teammates. It is also seen on **Toxtricity** and **Hatenna** (via breeding/evolution), providing rare utility for Special attackers or slow support builds.
* **Acquisition:** This move is generally part of a Pokémon's natural level-up pool or an Egg Move; it is **not available via TM or TR**, making its distribution strictly controlled.
