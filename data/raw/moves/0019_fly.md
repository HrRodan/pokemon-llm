## Identity & Mechanics
**Fly** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user takes to the skies on the first turn, soaring high above the battlefield to enter a semi-invulnerable state. On the second turn, the user descends rapidly to strike the target with high-velocity force. This move is historically significant as both a tactical combat tool and a vital Hidden Machine (HM) for overworld travel.
* **Effect:** A two-turn move. On the first turn, the user becomes semi-invulnerable, causing most moves to miss. On the second turn, damage is dealt. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, specific moves like **Gust, Hurricane, Sky Uppercut, Smack Down, Thunder, Twister,** and **Whirlwind** can still hit the user while in the air. Gust and Twister deal double damage to a flying target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Semi-Invulnerable STAB / Tactical Stall.
* **Usage:** In standard singles, Fly is often considered a "Low-Consistency" move because the two-turn delay allows the opponent to switch to a resistant "Check" (like a Rock or Steel type). However, it sees niche use for stalling out turns of **Terrain, Weather, or Poison/Burn damage**. In Generation 8, it was highly prized as the base for **Max Airstream**, providing a massive Speed boost. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is blocked by the move **Gravity** and cannot be used while that effect is active. It is also incompatible with **Sleep Talk**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (135 learners), as nearly every avian or winged Pokémon has access to it.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Dragonite**, **Charizard**, **Corviknight**, **Salamence**, and the legendary **Rayquaza**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-traditional flyers like **Golurk** (Ground/Ghost) or **Flygon** (Ground/Dragon) to provide Flying-type coverage or to bypass Ground-type immunities.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common acquisition; it has functioned as **HM02** in most early generations and remains a staple **TM** in modern releases (e.g., TM097 in Scarlet/Violet).
