**## Identity & Mechanics**
**Instruct** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user exerts a powerful mental command over a target, focusing its psychic energy to orchestrate the flow of battle. By telepathically guiding the target, the user compels them to immediately repeat their most recent action. This move is a tactical masterstroke, allowing for the immediate duplication of powerful attacks or crucial utility moves.
* **Effect:** The target immediately uses its most recently used move again. This repeat action is independent of the target’s normal move for the turn, meaning a Pokémon can effectively move twice in a single round. The move consumes PP from the target as usual and functions even if the repeated move is currently Disabled or affected by Torment.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (most effectively used on an ally in Double Battles).

**## Competitive Profile**
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Tactical Support / Force Multiplier.**
* **Usage:** Instruct is a cornerstone of specific **VGC and Double Battle** archetypes. Unlike *Helping Hand*, which simply boosts power, Instruct allows an ally to trigger secondary effects twice or bypass "once-per-turn" limitations. It is most commonly paired with **Spread Move** attackers (e.g., Torkoal's *Eruption* or Ursaluna-Bloodmoon's *Blood Moon*) to overwhelm the opponent with sheer volume of damage. It is frequently used within **Trick Room** teams to ensure the slow Instruct-user can command a heavy hitter before the opponent can react.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, Psychic-category status move. It fails if the target has not moved yet in the turn or if the last move used was one of a specific set of "un-instructible" moves (like *Transform* or *Focus Punch*).

**## Distribution & Notable Users**
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of the Sage Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Oranguru**. The move defines Oranguru's niche in competitive play, transforming it from a standard Trick Room setter into a unique offensive enabler.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a status move, it provides no type coverage, but its Psychic typing means it is blocked by Pokémon with the **Good as Gold** ability or those behind a **Substitute** (if targeted aggressively), and it can be reflected by **Magic Coat**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it must be learned naturally via leveling up by its singular user.
