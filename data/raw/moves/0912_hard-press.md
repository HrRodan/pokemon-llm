## Identity & Mechanics
**Hard Press** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user exerts immense mechanical pressure or physical force, crushing the target with a heavy limb, claw, or metallic body part. This move utilizes hydraulic-like strength to punish healthy opponents, making it a "reverse-execute" style attack where the force is dictated by the target's remaining vitality.
* **Effect:** The power of this move is variable, scaling directly with the target's remaining HP. The formula generally follows: **100 × (Current HP / Max HP)**. This means the move is most devastating when the opponent is at full health and loses potency as the target's HP decreases.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Early-game Wallbreaker / Anti-Lead STAB.
* **Usage:** Hard Press serves as a reliable alternative to *Heavy Slam* or *Iron Head*. Unlike *Heavy Slam*, its damage is not dependent on the user's weight, making it superior for lighter Steel-types or when facing extremely heavy opponents like Dondozo. It is best used on the first turn an opponent hits the field to maximize damage output. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), primarily found among heavy-set, metallic, or physically imposing Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Metagross**, **Scizor**, **Archaludon**, and **Tinkaton**. Archaludon, in particular, leverages this move in competitive VGC and Singles as a consistent Steel-type STAB option that doesn't rely on weight tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Steel Pokémon like **Snorlax**, **Tyranitar**, and **Ursaluna-Bloodmoon** to provide vital coverage against Fairy-type switch-ins that otherwise resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM225** in the Scarlet & Violet DLC (The Indigo Disk), allowing a vast array of physical attackers to adopt it for specialized coverage.
