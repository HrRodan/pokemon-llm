## Identity & Mechanics
**Dual Wingbeat** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rapid aerial assault, slamming the target twice in quick succession using its wings. This kinetic, multi-strike maneuver allows winged combatants to exert pressure through a flurry of feathers and force, often overwhelming the opponent's immediate defenses.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage twice in a single turn. This allows the move to break through **Focus Sashes**, the **Sturdy** ability, and **Substitutes**, with the second hit dealing damage to the target's HP directly if the first hit breaks the protection.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Multi-hit property is the primary utility).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40 (Per hit; Total 80), Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Multi-hit Utility / Technician Core.
* **Usage:** It serves as a reliable middle-ground for Physical Flying-type attackers. Compared to **Brave Bird**, it lacks recoil damage, making it safer for long-term survival. Compared to **Acrobatics**, it does not require the user to forgo a held item. It is particularly devastating on Pokémon with the **Technician** ability, which boosts each hit's power from 40 to 60 (120 total). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs twice.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (133 learners), primarily granted to Pokémon with visible wings or avian features.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Scyther** and **Scizor** (who benefit from the Technician boost), **Dragonite** (providing a rare Physical Flying STAB option), and **Corviknight**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Flying Pokémon like **Flygon**, **Gligar**, and **Slither Wing** to provide essential coverage against Fighting and Bug-type threats that might otherwise wall their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a move tutor option in the Sword & Shield Expansion Pass and as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in Scarlet & Violet.
