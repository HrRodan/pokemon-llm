## Identity & Mechanics
**Sweet Kiss** is a **Status Fairy-type** move introduced in **Generation II**.
* **Description:** The user approaches the target with an endearing or affectionate gesture, delivering a distracting kiss that leaves the foe dazed and bewildered. This thematic charm serves as a psychological disruption, inducing a state of disorientation.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Confusion** status condition on the target. While confused, the target has a 33% chance (as of Gen 7) to hurt itself in its confusion instead of executing its intended move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the status condition).
* **Targeting:** Single non-user target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 75%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Disruption / RNG Utility.**
* **Usage:** Sweet Kiss is generally considered a high-risk disruption tool. It is strictly inferior to **Confuse Ray** due to its 75% accuracy compared to Confuse Ray's 100%. In competitive play, it is often bypassed in favor of more reliable status moves like *Thunder Wave* or *Will-O-Wisp*. However, it can be used in "Para-Fusion" strategies (combining Paralysis and Confusion) to significantly reduce the opponent's chance of successfully attacking. It was originally a **Normal-type** move but was reclassified as **Fairy-type** in Generation VI.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; blocked by **Substitute**, **Magic Bounce**, and Pokémon with the **Own Tempo** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (45 learners), primarily limited to Pokémon characterized as "cute," "feminine," or "fairy-like."
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with the **Togekiss** line, **Clefable**, **Wigglytuff**, and **Alcremie**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Raichu (Alolan)** and **Pachirisu**, providing these Electric-types with a niche flavor-based disruption tool to force switches. **Tinkaton** also learns the move, fitting its mischievous persona.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through level-up or as an **Egg Move**. It is rarely available via TM/TR, making its presence in a moveset highly dependent on a Pokémon's natural learning pool.
