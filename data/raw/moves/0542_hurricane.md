## Identity & Mechanics
**Hurricane** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user manifests a devastating tempest, wrapping the target in a fierce, localized vortex that lofts them into the sky. This move represents the pinnacle of atmospheric power, often used by avian and elemental Pokémon to command the weather itself.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive special damage. It possesses the unique property of being able to strike targets during the semi-invulnerable turns of **Fly**, **Bounce**, and **Sky Drop**. Its accuracy is dynamic based on weather conditions: it never misses in **Rain** but drops to 50% accuracy in **Sun**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Confuse** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 70%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Rain-Abuser.
* **Usage:** Hurricane is the primary Flying-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for special attackers. Due to its low base accuracy, it is almost exclusively seen on **Rain Teams** where it becomes a perfectly accurate, spammable nuke. It is significantly more powerful than the more reliable *Air Slash*, making it a vital **Wallbreaker** tool. The 30% confusion chance provides a secondary "hax" win condition, making it difficult to switch into safely. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Fighting, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks in Rain; interacts with semi-invulnerable states.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among avian and dragon-like Pokémon (98 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Pelipper:** The premier Rain-setter (Drizzle) that utilizes Hurricane as its primary offensive threat.
    * **Tornadus (Therian/Incarnate):** The most iconic user of the move, often utilizing it to force progress in competitive tiers like OU.
    * **Pidgeot-Mega:** Leverages the *No Guard* ability to bypass Hurricane’s accuracy check regardless of weather.
    * **Zapdos:** Frequently carries the move in offensive or defensive Rain-based sets to punish Grass and Fighting types.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Flying Pokémon like **Volcarona**, **Dragonite**, and **Iron Moth** to provide high-power neutral coverage or to punish checks like Keldeo or Amoonguss.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** in modern generations (Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple late-game addition for many special attackers.
