## Identity & Mechanics
**Plasma Fists** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** The user coats its fists in high-voltage, crackling blue plasma and strikes the target with immense force. The resulting electrical discharge ionizes the battlefield, momentarily altering the molecular properties of the surrounding area so that even standard kinetic impacts resonate with electrical energy.
* **Effect:** After inflicting damage, all Normal-type moves used for the remainder of the turn—including Status moves—are converted into Electric-type moves. This effect is applied after type-changing abilities such as Pixilate, Aerilate, or Normalize have already triggered.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for status), but creates a temporary field-type effect on move types.
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Signature Nuke / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Plasma Fists is widely considered one of the best Physical Electric-type moves in the game. Unlike *Wild Charge*, it has no recoil damage, and it boasts significantly higher Power than *Thunder Punch*. Its secondary effect is highly technical: if the user outspeeds the opponent, it can turn an opponent's predicted Normal-type move (like *Extreme Speed*, *Fake Out*, or *Boomburst*) into an Electric-type move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, benefiting from the Iron Fist ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner), as it is a unique signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Mythical Pokémon **Zeraora**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move turns Normal moves into Electric moves, **Zeraora** can use it to gain a tactical immunity. Since Zeraora possesses the **Volt Absorb** ability, any Normal-type move directed at it after it has used Plasma Fists will instead heal it by 25% of its Max HP.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned only by Zeraora via level-up.
