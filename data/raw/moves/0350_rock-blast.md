## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Blast** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user gathers rocky debris or solid boulders and hurls them in a rapid-fire volley at the target. This multi-hit bombardment is visually depicted as a series of projectiles that can strike up to five times, making it ideal for overwhelming defensive measures that rely on single-hit protection.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage 2 to 5 times in a single turn. It has a 37.5% (3/8) chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% (1/8) chance to hit 4 or 5 times.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but its multi-hit nature allows it to bypass **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, and destroy a **Substitute** while still dealing damage to the Pokémon behind it.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (Per hit), Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Focus Sash/Sturdy Breaker.
* **Usage:** While its average power (approx. 75 across 3 hits) is lower than *Stone Edge* or *Rock Slide*, its utility in breaking through defensive gimmicks makes it a staple. In Generation IX, the introduction of the **Loaded Dice** item significantly buffed this move, guaranteeing 4 to 5 hits (100–125 base power). It is the preferred Rock-type STAB for Pokémon with the **Skill Link** ability, ensuring a devastating 125 base power every turn.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Bullet**/Projectile move, meaning it is blocked by the *Bulletproof* ability (e.g., Chesnaught).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (142 learners), primarily found among Rock, Ground, and heavy Physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Tyranitar**, **Gigalith**, **Garganacl**, and **Golem**. It is also a signature tool for **Mega Heracross**, which utilizes *Skill Link* to turn it into a high-powered nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon like **Cloyster** and **Cinccino** (with *Skill Link*) to provide essential coverage against Ice and Fire types, or **Machamp** (with *No Guard*) to ensure the move never misses its 90% accuracy check.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (specifically TM076 in SV and TM54 in SwSh).
