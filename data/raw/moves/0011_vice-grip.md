## Identity & Mechanics
**Vice-Grip** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The target is gripped and crushed with hard, powerful pincers or large mandibles. This move represents a physical feat of strength common among Pokémon with crustacean-like claws or mechanical crushing parts, delivering a straightforward strike of crushing force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target with no additional properties.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 55, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game Progression Move / Low-tier Filler.
* **Usage:** Vice-Grip serves as a basic physical attack for many Pokémon in their early levels. In competitive play, it is almost entirely outclassed by higher-output Normal-type moves such as **Return**, **Body Slam**, or **Double-Edge**. Because it is a Normal-type move, it deals **neutral damage** to most types but provides **no Super Effective coverage**.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, naturally learned by only **19** Pokémon, typically those possessing pincers or specialized jaws.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically associated with **Pinsir** and **Kingler**, who utilize their massive pincers for the attack. It is also a signature part of the early movepool for **Mawile** and **Crawdaunt**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on the Bug/Electric-type **Vikavolt** or the Steel/Bug-type **Durant** during the leveling process, though it offers no significant coverage advantage over their primary STAB options.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM or TR in any generation, making it strictly a level-up or "natural" move for its specific learner set.
