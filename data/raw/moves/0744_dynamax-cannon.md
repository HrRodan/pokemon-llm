## Identity & Mechanics
**Dynamax Cannon** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar Region).
* **Description:** The user focuses an immense surge of draconic energy within its core before unleashing it as a concentrated, high-intensity beam of light. This move is specifically designed as an anti-Dynamax weapon, radiating energy that reacts violently with the Galar particle signature of transformed Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Deals standard damage to normal targets but inflicts **double damage** (2.0x) if the target is currently Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. (Note: This move does not affect Eternamax Eternatus in the same way).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Meta Nuke.
* **Usage:** In its debut generation, Dynamax Cannon serves as a premier Special Dragon-type move. It is mathematically superior to *Dragon Pulse* (85 Power) and more reliable than *Draco Meteor* (130 Power) because it lacks the Special Attack drop drawback. Its niche as a "Max Move Killer" makes it indispensable in VGC or Ubers formats where Dynamaxing is permitted. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types and neutral damage to most others, being resisted only by Steel and ineffective against Fairy.
* **Attributes:** This is a beam-based move. It is not a contact move and is not affected by Iron Fist or similar contact-based abilities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the signature move of the Legendary Pokémon **Eternatus**. It is also utilized by its boss-only form, **Eternamax Eternatus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is an exclusive signature move, it is never seen as coverage on non-Dragon types. It is the primary tool used by Eternatus to check G-Max threats like Charizard, Lapras, or Venusaur.
* **Acquisition:** This move is learned naturally by Eternatus and cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to any other Pokémon. It remains one of the most exclusive high-power moves in the series.
