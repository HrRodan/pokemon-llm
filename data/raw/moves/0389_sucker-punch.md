## Identity & Mechanics
**Sucker Punch** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region). 
* **Description:** The user anticipates the opponent's strike and lunges forward to deliver a preemptive blow. Despite the name "Punch" in English, the move is categorized as a "Surprise Attack" in its original context, involving the user outmaneuvering the foe the moment they drop their guard to initiate an attack. This creates a high-stakes psychological "mind game" on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** This move has a **Priority of +1**, allowing the user to strike before most other moves. However, it **fails** if the target is not preparing a damaging move (e.g., using a Status move like *Substitute* or *Will-O-Wisp*) or if the target has already moved within the same priority bracket.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. Its success is entirely dependent on the target's move selection.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Priority Revenge Killer / Mind Game Utility.
* **Usage:** Sucker Punch is a staple in competitive play used to bypass a target's superior Speed. It is often compared to **Knock Off**; while Knock Off provides utility and consistent damage, Sucker Punch provides the essential ability to "check" faster threats or sweepers. It is notoriously used to create "50/50" scenarios where the opponent must decide between attacking (and getting hit by Sucker Punch) or using a status move to force a failure. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite its name, this move is **not** boosted by the Ability *Iron Fist*. It is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rough Skin* or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Sucker Punch has a wide distribution, learned by 171 different species across various generations, making it a common sight in almost every tier of play.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Kingambit / Bisharp:** Perhaps the most iconic users, utilizing STAB-boosted Sucker Punch to sweep teams late-game.
    * **Yveltal:** A legendary powerhouse that uses its *Dark Aura* ability to turn Sucker Punch into a terrifying priority nuke.
    * **Cinderace:** Often uses the move to gain priority and change its type via *Libero*.
    * **Chien-Pao:** Leverages its massive Attack and *Sword of Ruin* ability to pick off weakened foes.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Gengar**, **Toxicroak**, and **Dragapult**. These Pokémon use it as a "bracket-breaker" to hit faster Psychic or Ghost-type threats that would otherwise outspeed and KO them.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a Move Tutor or Egg Move, it has become more accessible in recent generations through TMs and natural level-up progression for deceptive or predatory Pokémon.
