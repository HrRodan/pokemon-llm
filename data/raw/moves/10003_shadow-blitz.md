## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Blitz** is a physical Shadow-type move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically exclusive to the GameCube titles *Pokémon Colosseum* and *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user cloaks itself in a dark, ominous aura and tackles the target. This move represents the raw, unrefined aggression of a Shadow Pokémon whose heart has been artificially closed. It is characterized by a purple and black energy discharge upon impact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage. In the context of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, Shadow moves like Shadow Blitz are unique in that they deal **Super Effective** damage to all non-Shadow Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (Shadow moves do not utilize standard PP).
* **Role:** Early-game Chip Damage / Shadow STAB.
* **Usage:** Within the Orre-region games, Shadow Blitz serves as the basic, reliable physical attack for newly captured Shadow Pokémon. While its base power is low (comparable to *Tackle* or *Pound*), its unique typing makes it a versatile tool for weakening other Pokémon for capture. In *Pokémon XD*, its "Super Effective" properties against all non-shadow types make it significantly more potent than its base power suggests.
* **Type Matchups:** Deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow Pokémon** (in *XD*) or **Neutral** damage to all types (in *Colosseum*). It is **Not Very Effective** against other Shadow Pokémon.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Static or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Shadow Blitz has a narrow distribution, limited strictly to Shadow Pokémon encountered in the Orre Region. It cannot be learned by purified Pokémon or moveset-imported Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently the starting Shadow move for early-game captures such as **Shadow Teddiursa**, **Shadow Poochyena**, and **Shadow Gulpin**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Shadow moves are replaced upon purification, this move provides temporary "universal coverage" for Shadow Pokémon during the main story of *Pokémon XD*, allowing physical attackers like **Shadow Houndour** to hit traditionally resistant types for super effective damage.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Breeding; it is a "natural" move known by Shadow Pokémon upon encounter.
