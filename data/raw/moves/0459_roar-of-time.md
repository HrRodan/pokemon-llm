## Identity & Mechanics
**Roar of Time** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh) as the signature move of the Legendary Pokémon Dialga.
* **Description:** The user lets out a primordial roar that releases a concentrated blast of temporal energy, distorting the very fabric of time to annihilate the target. The sheer force of this chronal disruption is so taxing that the user is momentarily frozen in time, requiring a turn to recover.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage, but the user must "recharge" on the following turn. During the recharge turn, the user cannot move, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The recharge is a mandatory negative mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Roar of Time is the Dragon-type equivalent of Hyper Beam or Giga Impact. While its base power is immense, the mandatory recharge turn is a significant "Momentum Killer" in competitive play, often allowing the opponent a free switch-in or a "setup turn" to use Dragon Dance or Calm Mind. In the Uber tier, it is often bypassed in favor of **Draco Meteor**, which allows for pivoting and immediate switching despite the Special Attack drop. However, it can be used as a desperate "Final Gambit" to secure a knockout on a critical threat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-like special attack. Despite the name, it is not classified as a "Sound-based" move and is not blocked by the Soundproof Ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), as it is the unique signature move of the temporal deity.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Dialga** and its **Dialga-Origin Forme**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it has no coverage utility on other Pokémon. It provides Dialga with the highest potential Special Dragon-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage in a single hit.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned naturally by Dialga upon reaching a high level or appearing in its Origin Forme.
