## Identity & Mechanics
**Night Slash** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user focuses their energy into a single, swift strike, slashing the opponent the moment their guard drops. By channeling dark energy into a blade, claw, or appendage, the user executes a high-precision attack designed to bypass defenses by striking a vital point.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move possesses an inherently high critical-hit ratio (increased by one stage), making it significantly more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages and Reflect/Aurora Veil.
* **Secondary Effect:** Increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Crit-Fishing Offense.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than **Crunch** (80) or **Knock Off** (65/97.5), Night Slash is valued for its reliability and synergy with critical-hit-focused builds. In Generation IX, it gained significant viability as a **Slicing Move**, receiving a 50% power boost from the **Sharpness** ability, effectively raising its base power to 105. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Slicing/Sharp** move, benefiting from specific ability-based modifiers and being blocked by effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution across the physical attacker pool (115 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Dark-type physical threats utilize this move for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), most notably **Kingambit**, **Bisharp**, **Weavile**, and **Hisuian Samurott** (which utilizes its Ceaseless Edge alongside Night Slash for a Sharpness-boosted offensive core).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon that require ways to hit Ghost-types, such as **Gallade** (Sharpness synergy), **Ceruledge**, and **Sceptile**. **Kartana** also utilizes it as a vital coverage option in higher competitive tiers.
* **Acquisition:** While initially learned via level-up by many "bladed" Pokémon, it has been widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in every generation since its debut.
