## Identity & Mechanics
**Baneful Bunker** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user hunkers down within a reinforced, toxic shell to create an impenetrable barrier. This defensive maneuver completely negates incoming damage and secondary effects for the turn, while simultaneously secreting a potent toxin that infects any opponent foolish enough to make physical contact. It is a signature defensive tool designed for high-endurance "stall" tactics.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all effects of moves (including damage) for the duration of the turn. If an opponent targets the user with a move that makes **contact**, that opponent is immediately inflicted with the **Poison** status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Poison the attacker upon contact. Success rate halves (1/2, 1/4, etc.) if used consecutively with other protection moves (Protect, Detect, Endure, etc.).
* **Targeting:** Affects the User; Priority +4.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —- %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Defensive Punisher / Stall.
* **Usage:** Baneful Bunker is a strictly superior version of *Protect* for its users. It is primarily used to scout the opponent's choice of move, rack up "passive damage" from weather or existing status, and punish physical attackers (like U-turn users or Close Combat users). While it does not chip health like *Spiky Shield*, the Poison status is often more valuable for long-term "walling," as it limits the longevity of the attacker throughout the entire match. It deals **Super Effective** damage to nothing (as it is a status move), but the Poison status it inflicts is particularly effective at wearing down **Fairy** and **Grass** types that lack immunity.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; Priority +4 ensures it almost always moves first; Does not protect against certain moves like *Feint*, *Phantom Force*, or Pokémon with the *Unseen Fist* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move with only **1** natural learner.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Toxapex**. Toxapex is a premier defensive wall in competitive play, and Baneful Bunker is a cornerstone of its "Merciless" or "Regenerator" sets, allowing it to scout threats while slowly draining the opponent's resources.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not seen on other Pokémon. It is the primary reason physical attackers are hesitant to target Toxapex directly, forcing them to rely on non-contact moves like *Earthquake* or *Psychic*.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it must be learned naturally by the Mareanie line.
