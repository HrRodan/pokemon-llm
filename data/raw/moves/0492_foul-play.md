## Identity & Mechanics
**Foul Play** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user deceptively exploits the opponent's aggression, turning their own physical momentum against them. Rather than relying on its own muscle, the user waits for the target to commit to an attack and redirects that power into a punishing counter-strike. This makes it a premier tool for defensive Pokémon to deal significant damage regardless of their own offensive shortcomings.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the **target's Attack stat** and Attack stat modifiers (e.g., Swords Dance boosts) instead of the user’s. However, it still benefits from the user’s held items (like Choice Band or Life Orb) and the user’s STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Defensive Punisher / Anti-Sweeper Utility.
* **Usage:** Foul Play is the ultimate "Equalizer." It is the preferred Dark-type STAB for defensive walls who lack high Attack stats. It is specifically designed to punish **Physical Sweepers** and **Setup Sweepers**; the more the opponent boosts their Attack, the more damage Foul Play deals. It is frequently compared to **Knock Off** (which provides utility by removing items) and **Crunch** (which relies on the user's own Attack). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (198 learners), making it a common sight in both casual and competitive play.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Umbreon:** Perhaps the most iconic user; it utilizes its massive bulk to stay on the field and Foul Play to threaten physical attackers it couldn't otherwise scratch.
    * **Mandibuzz:** A premier defensive pivot that uses Foul Play to prevent itself from being passive.
    * **Grimmsnarl:** Often pairs this move with *Prankster* screens to survive hits and then retaliate against boosted foes.
    * **Yveltal:** In Ubers, its *Dark Aura* ability boosts the power of Foul Play to nuclear levels, making it a terrifying check to physical legendary threats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Klefki**, **Amoonguss**, and **Porygon2** as a "disincentive" move. It prevents opponents from using them as "setup fodder" to gain free Attack boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet, and was a common Move Tutor option in previous generations.
