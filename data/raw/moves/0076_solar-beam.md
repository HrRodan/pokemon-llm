## Identity & Mechanics
**Solar Beam** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user absorbs concentrated sunlight to charge a massive reserve of thermal and botanical energy. On the following turn, it releases this stored power as a high-intensity, destructive pillar of golden light. This move represents the peak of photosynthetic offensive capability.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn move. The user spends the first turn "charging" and attacks on the second turn. However, if **Harsh Sunlight** is active, the charge turn is skipped, allowing the move to be used instantly. 
* **Secondary Effect:** In Weather conditions other than Sun (Rain, Sandstorm, Hail/Snow), the base power of the move is halved to 60. This move cannot be called by Sleep Talk.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Weather-Dependent Nuke** / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Solar Beam is a staple on **Sun Teams**. Outside of the sun, it is generally considered unviable because the charge turn allows the opponent to switch into a resistant Pokémon or KO the user. Within the sun, it becomes one of the strongest Special Grass moves with no drawbacks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Considered a beam-based move (interacts with Mega Launcher in some side games, though not traditionally a "Pulse" move in mainline mechanics).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (403 learners), being one of the most common TMs in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Venusaur:** The premier user, often utilizing the **Chlorophyll** ability to double its speed and fire off instant Solar Beams in the sun.
    * **Mega Charizard Y / Groudon:** Both possess the **Drought** (or Desolate Land) ability, setting their own weather to turn Solar Beam into a reliable 120-power coverage tool.
    * **Exeggutor:** A classic Gen I threat that uses the move to punish bulky Water types.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Fire-type Pokémon like **Volcarona**, **Typhlosion**, and **Ninetales**. It provides essential coverage to hit the Water, Rock, and Ground types that typically check Fire-types.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has appeared as **TM22** or a Technical Record (TR) in nearly every generation, including the original Kanto games through to *Scarlet & Violet*.
