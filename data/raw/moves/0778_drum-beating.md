## Identity & Mechanics
**Drum Beating** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user, typically Rillaboom, rhythmically strikes its drum with primal intensity, channeling the sound to command thick, gnarled roots that erupt from the earth. These roots lash out and entangle the target, physically battering them while hindering their movement through the constricting vines.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and provides guaranteed utility by reducing the opponent's mobility.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s **Speed** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Speed Control Utility.
* **Usage:** Drum Beating serves as a high-utility signature move. While it lacks the sheer raw power of *Wood Hammer* (120 BP) or the priority of *Grassy Glide* (in Grassy Terrain), it provides essential **Speed Control**. By guaranteed-slowing the opponent, it can force switches, break Choice Scarf momentum, or allow the user to outspeed and land a finishing blow on the following turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move (despite being physical), meaning it avoids chip damage from abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of the Galar region's Grass-type starter evolution line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Rillaboom**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not seen on non-Grass Pokémon. However, on Rillaboom, it is often paired with the ability **Grassy Surge** to boost its damage output by 30% via Grassy Terrain, making the 80 BP much more threatening.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned strictly via evolution or leveling within the Rillaboom line.
