## Identity & Mechanics
**Anchor Shot** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user hurls a massive, rusted anchor at the opponent, entangling them in heavy iron chains upon impact. This seafaring strike combines blunt force with restrictive metalwork to ensure the target cannot escape the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and prevents the target from switching out or fleeing as long as the user remains active.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the **Trapping** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Trapping Utility / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** While its base power is comparable to *Iron Head*, Anchor Shot is significantly more dangerous due to its trapping mechanic. It allows the user to lock in a passive wall or a favorable matchup, preventing the opponent from "Pivoting" to a counter. It is one of the few physical Steel moves that offers guaranteed utility beyond simple damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is the signature move of Dhelmise.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Dhelmise**. Because Dhelmise possesses the "Steelworker" ability (which boosts Steel-type moves by 50%), Anchor Shot effectively functions as a third STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move despite Dhelmise being a Grass/Ghost type.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently unavailable as a coverage option for other Pokémon, as it cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to other species.
* **Acquisition:** Learned naturally via leveling up by Dhelmise. It serves as the cornerstone of Dhelmise's competitive identity, allowing it to trap and eliminate Fairy-type threats like Clefable or Tapu Bulu.
