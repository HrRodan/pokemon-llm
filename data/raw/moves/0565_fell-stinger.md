## Identity & Mechanics
**Fell Stinger** is a physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user stabs the target with a sharp stinger or barb to deliver a finishing blow. If the attack successfully knocks out the opponent, the user's adrenaline and momentum surge, resulting in a massive increase to their physical offensive power. This move is designed for "snowballing" through teams by capitalizing on weakened foes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is fainted by this move, the user’s Attack stat rises by **three stages** (since Generation VII; it was two stages in Gen VI).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the Attack boost **only upon KO**.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** **Revenge Killing Finisher** / **Setup Sweeper**.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low (often weaker than X-Scissor or U-turn), its utility lies in its astronomical reward for securing a KO. It is a high-risk, high-reward move typically used on fast, frail attackers to "clean up" a weakened Pokémon and immediately become an unstoppable threat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic, Dark, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (24 learners), primarily limited to insectoid or venomous Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Mega Beedrill:** Perhaps the most iconic user, utilizing its massive Speed and *Adaptability* ability to make this low-power move hit hard enough to snag KOs.
    * **Buzzwole:** Combined with its *Beast Boost* ability, a Fell Stinger KO can result in a +4 Attack boost in a single turn, making it a terrifying physical wallbreaker.
    * **Genesect:** Occasionally carries this in niche physical sets to capitalize on its Steel/Bug STAB.
* **Coverage Utility:** It is seen on non-Bug types like **Inteleon** and **Overqwil**. Inteleon uses it as a surprise physical tech, while Overqwil leverages it to complement its Dark/Poison offensive pressure.
* **Acquisition:** It is not a common TM; it is mostly learned via level-up or as an Egg Move in specific biological groups (Bug and Water 3).
