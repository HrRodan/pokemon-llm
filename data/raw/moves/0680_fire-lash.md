## Identity & Mechanics
**Fire Lash** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user manifests a searing, whip-like cord of concentrated flame to strike the opponent with intense heat and physical force. This lashing motion is not only thermal but abrasive, searing through the target's armor and weakening their physical fortitude.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and guaranteed secondary effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target's **Defense** stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Progressive Wallbreaker / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Fire Lash is an exceptionally potent utility move because of its guaranteed stat drop. Unlike *Flare Blitz*, which offers higher immediate power but inflicts recoil, Fire Lash rewards longevity. By lowering Defense every turn, it forces switches and effectively increases its own damage output (and that of physical teammates) with every successful hit. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution (4 learners), making it a rare and specialized tool in the competitive circuit.
* **Prominent Users:** Originally the signature move of **Heatmor**, it is most effectively utilized by **Centiskorch**, which leverages its high Attack and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) to dismantle defensive walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** While **Salazzle** is primarily a Special Attacker, it can use Fire Lash in niche physical or mixed sets to punish Specially Defensive switch-ins. **Sizzlipede** serves as the early-game representative for this move in the Galar region.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is **not available via TM or TR**, restricted entirely to the natural level-up learnsets of its few users.
