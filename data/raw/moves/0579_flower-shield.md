## Identity & Mechanics
**Flower Shield** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** The user manifests a mysterious, mystical floral power that resonates with nature, creating a protective botanical barrier. This energy specifically hardens the cellular composition of plant-based life forms on the battlefield, shielding them from physical harm.
* **Effect:** Raises the **Defense** stat of all **Grass-type** Pokémon currently on the field by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the Defense of valid targets. 
* **Targeting:** **All Pokémon** (Field-wide). It affects every Grass-type on the field, including the user, allies, and even opponents.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Always hits), PP 10.
* **Role:** **Niche Support / Tribal Utility.**
* **Usage:** Flower Shield is a highly specialized move primarily designed for **Doubles or Triple Battles**. Unlike *Iron Defense* or *Acid Armor* which only buff the user, Flower Shield acts as a "tribal" buff. It is most effective in dedicated "Sun Teams" or Grass-heavy compositions where it can boost multiple teammates simultaneously. Because it targets the field, its primary drawback is the potential to accidentally buff an opponent's Grass-type. It helps Grass-types mitigate their physical weaknesses to types like **Flying, Poison, and Bug.**
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, status-based field effect. It is blocked by *Protect* or *Detect* and can be stolen by *Snatch*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (only 5 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably utilized by **Florges**, **Comfey**, and **Cherrim**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** The move is rarely used by the user for self-buffing (as most users are not Grass-types themselves, with the exception of Sunflora and Cherrim). Instead, it is used by **Florges** or **Comfey** as a **Support Pivot** to increase the physical bulk of a Grass-type partner like Rillaboom, Ferrothorn, or Kartana.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor in any generation, restricted entirely to natural level-up or egg move pools for its few users.
