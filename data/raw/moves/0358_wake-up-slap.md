## Identity & Mechanics
**Wake-Up Slap** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user delivers a forceful, stinging slap to the target. While it functions as a standard martial arts strike under normal conditions, it is specifically designed to shock a dormant opponent back to consciousness. The impact is calibrated to exploit the vulnerability of a sleeping target, delivering a jarring blow that disrupts their slumber.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is currently under the **Sleep** status condition (including self-induced sleep from *Rest*), this move’s base power is doubled. However, the target is immediately cured of sleep upon being hit.
* **Secondary Effect:** Power doubles to **140** against sleeping targets, but removes the Sleep status.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Conditional Nuke / Niche Utility.**
* **Usage:** Wake-Up Slap is a high-risk technical move. While its base 70 power is respectable, it is generally outclassed by more consistent Fighting STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) options like *Close Combat* or *Drain Punch*. Its primary value lies in its massive 140 power potential against sleepers, though this comes at the cost of losing the free turns provided by the Sleep status. It is most effective in "Sleep-Trap" strategies involving *Sing*, *Hypnosis*, or *Spore*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow but diverse distribution (30 total learners), appearing mostly on humanoid or "hand-based" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is most iconic on heavy-hitting Fighting types like **Machamp**, **Hariyama**, and **Conkeldurr**, who can utilize their high Attack stats to turn the doubled power into a one-hit knockout (OHKO).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on unexpected non-Fighting Pokémon such as **Clefairy**, **Miltank**, and **Froslass** to provide physical coverage against Steel and Dark-type threats that might otherwise wall them. **Meloetta (Pirouette Forme)** also utilizes this move as a flavor-accurate STAB option.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it is rarely available as a TM or TR, making its presence in a moveset highly specific to the Pokémon's natural kit.
