## Identity & Mechanics
**Rising Voltage** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** The user channels high-frequency electrical energy into the ground, causing a violent surge of voltage to erupt beneath the target. This move is specifically designed to resonate with environmental electricity, becoming a devastating pillar of light when the battlefield is charged.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. If the target is currently "grounded" (affected by Electric Terrain), the base power of this move is doubled from 70 to 140.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power amplification is the primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70 (140 in Terrain), Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Terrain-Dependent Nuke / Field Abuser.
* **Usage:** Rising Voltage is the premier choice for "Electric Terrain" teams. While its base power is lower than **Thunderbolt** (90) or **Thunder** (110) under normal conditions, its 140 BP potential makes it one of the strongest non-recoil Special attacks in the game. It is used to punish any grounded Pokémon, dealing **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types (though Flying-types are typically immune to the terrain boost unless grounded by Iron Ball, Gravity, or Smack Down).
* **Attributes:** This move does not make contact. It relies entirely on the presence of **Electric Terrain** to reach its maximum damage ceiling, often paired with the **Electric Surge** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (62 learners), primarily concentrated among Electric-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Alolan Raichu:** Its *Surge Surfer* ability doubles its Speed in Electric Terrain, making it a terrifying "Terrain Sweeper" when using a 140 BP STAB Rising Voltage.
    * **Regieleki:** Combined with the *Transistor* ability and Electric Terrain, Rising Voltage becomes a near-unstoppable nuke capable of OHKOing even neutral resists.
    * **Raging Bolt:** As a high-Special Attack Paradox Pokémon, it utilizes this move in VGC and Singles formats when paired with a terrain setter.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Tapu Koko** (in formats where both exist) or **Pincurchin**, who can set the terrain themselves before attacking. **Toxtricity** also utilizes it to capitalize on its high Special Attack during terrain-heavy matchups.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a **Move Tutor** move in the *Isle of Armor* expansion (Gen VIII). Its availability in later generations is more restricted, often requiring specific move-reminder or TM access depending on the regional Pokédex.
