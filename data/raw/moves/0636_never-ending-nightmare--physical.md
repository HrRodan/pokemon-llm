## Identity & Mechanics
**Never-Ending Nightmare (Physical)** is a Physical Ghost-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** Fueled by the user's deep-seated grudges and channeled through Ghostium Z, the user manifests a terrifying void of spiritual energy. Ethereal, shadowy hands and dark apparitions emerge from the ground to seize and overwhelm the opponent in a relentless assault. As a Z-Move, it represents the absolute peak of Ghost-type offensive power, often used to bypass the limitations of standard physical Ghost moves like low base power or contact-related penalties.
* **Effect:** This move can only be used if the trainer possesses a Z-Ring (or Z-Power Ring) and the Pokémon is holding **Ghostium Z** while knowing a physical Ghost-type move. It inflicts massive damage based on the power of the original base move.
* **Secondary Effect:** As a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy checks (cannot miss) and penetrates **Protect** and **Detect**, dealing 25% of its total power through these shields.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–200], Accuracy --%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used to secure a One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) on bulky Psychic or Ghost-type threats that could otherwise survive a standard hit. Because physical Ghost-type moves like **Shadow Claw** (Base 70) and **Shadow Bone** (Base 85) have relatively low power, Never-Ending Nightmare provides a necessary burst of damage to break through defensive cores. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; power is determined by the base move (e.g., Shadow Bone becomes a 160 BP nuke; Phantom Force becomes 175 BP).

## Distribution & Notable Users
While the move is technically available to any Pokémon capable of learning a physical Ghost-type move, its usage is concentrated among specific physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Mimikyu:** Frequently uses this via *Shadow Claw* to shore up its damage output alongside Disguise-enabled setup.
    * **Marowak-Alola:** Utilizes its signature *Shadow Bone* as a base to create a devastatingly high-powered STAB nuke.
    * **Decidueye:** While it has a signature Z-Move, it can utilize this version via *Spirit Shackle* or *Leaf Blade* (if using Ghostium Z) for specific type-matchup needs.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Necrozma-Dusk-Mane** or **Aegislash** to provide a massive physical Ghost-type hit that doesn't require a charge turn (unlike Phantom Force).
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Ghostium Z** crystal, typically obtained in the Thrifty Megamart (Abandoned Site) during the Alolan Island Challenge.
