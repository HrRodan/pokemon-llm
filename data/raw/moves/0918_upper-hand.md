## Identity & Mechanics
**Upper Hand** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user anticipates the target's attack and strikes preemptively with the heel of its palm. This reactionary martial arts strike is designed to intercept and punish fast-acting opponents, causing them to flinch before they can execute their own move. As a specialized "counter-priority" technique, it relies entirely on the opponent attempting a quick strike.
* **Effect:** This move has a **Priority of +3**. It succeeds only if the target has selected a priority move (e.g., Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, Fake Out). If the target is not using a priority move, Upper Hand fails.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **Flinch** the target upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Anti-Priority Utility / Technical Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Upper Hand serves as a hard "check" to priority-heavy attackers. Because it sits at **+3 Priority**, it outspeeds common +2 priority moves like **Extreme Speed** and +1 moves like **Sucker Punch, Jet Punch, and Mach Punch**. It is particularly effective in VGC (Doubles) to shut down Fake Out leads, as it shares the same priority bracket but requires the opponent to be targeting the user or their ally with a priority move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution with **63** different Pokémon capable of learning it, primarily those with martial arts themes or high dexterity.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by Fighting-type specialists like **Hariyama**, **Lucario**, **Gallade**, and the Paldean starter **Quaquaval**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Fighting Pokémon such as **Greninja**, **Sneasler**, and **Talonflame** to provide a technical answer to priority-reliant revenge killers.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in the Paldea region, specifically within the Blueberry Academy curriculum.
