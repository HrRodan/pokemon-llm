## Identity & Mechanics
**Substitute** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user sacrifices exactly 25% of its maximum HP to create a decoy doll that acts as a tactical decoy. This construct absorbs direct damage and serves as a barrier against most status conditions, stat-lowering effects, and certain technical moves. It is a cornerstone of defensive stalling and safe offensive setup.
* **Effect:** Transfers 1/4 of the user’s max HP into a doll. The doll uses the user's current defensive stats and typing for damage calculation. While the doll is active, the user is immune to primary status (Poison, Burn, Sleep, Paralyze, Freeze) and most secondary effects of moves.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Status Move). However, it effectively "blocks" the secondary effects of opposing moves, such as the 10% Freeze chance from Ice Beam.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Setup Buffer / Stall Tool.
* **Usage:** Substitute is a premier tactical move used to punish "passive" play. If an opponent switches or uses a Status move (like Will-O-Wisp or Toxic), the user gains a "free" Substitute, providing a buffer that must be broken before the user can be damaged. It is often paired with **Baton Pass** to transfer the shield to a teammate, or with **Leech Seed** (the "SubSeed" strategy) to drain the opponent while remaining protected.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage.
* **Attributes:** Bypassed by **Sound-based moves** (e.g., Boomburst, Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice) and Pokémon with the **Infiltrator** ability. It also blocks the **Intimidate** ability upon the user switching in.
