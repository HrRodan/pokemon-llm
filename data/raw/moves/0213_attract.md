## Identity & Mechanics
**Attract** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user exerts an irresistible charm, a mesmerizing scent, or an endearing display of affection to captivate the opponent. This psychological maneuver induces the "Infatuation" status condition, clouding the target's judgment and making them hesitant to land an attack against the object of their affection.
* **Effect:** Causes the target to become infatuated. While infatuated, the target has a **50% chance to fail** to use a move each turn. The move automatically fails if used against a Pokémon of the same gender, a genderless Pokémon, or if the user itself is genderless. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The infatuation is the primary effect). The effect is removed if either the user or the target switches out.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Disruptive Utility / "Luck-based" Crowd Control (Hax).
* **Usage:** Attract is often categorized as a "high-variance" move. In competitive play, it is generally considered less reliable than **Thunder Wave** (Paralysis) or **Confuse Ray** because of its strict gender requirements. However, it is a staple in "Para-Flinch" or "Annoyer" sets, where it is stacked with paralysis and moves like Air Slash to virtually guarantee the opponent cannot move. It is completely countered by the **Oblivious** ability and the **Mental Herb** item.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage; however, it can be used against any type (including Ghosts) but fails against **Genderless** targets (e.g., Mewtwo, Metagross, Wash Rotom).
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not blocked by Protect if the user has the Unseen Fist ability (though standard Protect/Detect do block it).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (917 learners), being one of the most widely available TMs in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic "cute" or "beautiful" Pokémon such as **Pikachu**, **Milotic**, **Sylveon**, and **Gardevoir** frequently utilize it in casual and niche competitive sets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on bulky setup sweepers or stallers like **Blissey** or **Clefable** to force switches or create a 50% "free turn" to heal or boost stats. **Salazzle** is a notable user, fitting its thematic role as a pheromone-based predator.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM45** (Gens 2-7) and **TR06** (Gen 8). It is accessible to nearly every Pokémon that has a gender.
