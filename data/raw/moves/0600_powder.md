## Identity & Mechanics
**Powder** is a Status Bug-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user scatters a cloud of highly volatile, microscopic spores or scales over the opponent. These particles react violently to heat, causing immediate combustion that engulfs the foe in a localized explosion if they attempt to ignite a Fire-type attack. This provides a unique defensive layer for Bug-types, transforming their greatest weakness into a hazard for the opponent.
* **Effect:** Powder has a **Priority of +1**. If the target attempts to use a Fire-type move during the turn Powder is applied, the move fails instantly, and the target takes damage equal to **1/4 (25%) of its maximum HP**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None; the explosion is a guaranteed result of the target's move selection.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reactive Counter / Anti-Fire Utility.
* **Usage:** Powder is a high-skill, "prediction-reliant" move used to punish Fire-type attackers. Because it operates at +1 Priority, it can be applied before the opponent moves, effectively "priming" them to explode. It is particularly effective against Choice-locked Pokémon (like Entei or Chi-Yu) or Sun-team sweepers who rely on STAB Fire moves. It differs from *Protect* by not only stopping the damage but also stripping a quarter of the opponent's health.
* **Type Matchups:** While the move itself is Bug-type, its mechanic specifically targets **Fire-type** move users. Note: It does not deal Super Effective damage; it deals fixed percentage-based damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Powder-based move**. Pokémon with the Ability *Overcoat*, or those holding *Safety Goggles*, are immune to its effects. Grass-type Pokémon are also immune to powder-based moves as of Gen VI.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily associated with **Vivillon** (its signature move upon introduction) and **Ribombee** (via Cutiefly). 
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a "coverage" move in the traditional sense, it is utilized by these Bug-types to punish "Check" or "Counter" Pokémon like **Charizard**, **Incineroar**, or **Heatran** who expect an easy KO with Fire-type STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Very rare; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor, and is restricted to the level-up sets of specific Bug/Flying or Bug/Fairy evolutionary lines.
