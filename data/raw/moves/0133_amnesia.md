## Identity & Mechanics
**Amnesia** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user clears its mind and empties its thoughts to forget its immediate concerns. This mental reset allows the user to focus entirely on its inner fortitude, creating a psychic barrier that minimizes the impact of incoming elemental and mental assaults. This flavor is often associated with Pokémon that are either dim-witted, highly meditative, or biologically resilient.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user’s Special Defense stat by two stages (+2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Special Tanking.
* **Usage:** While often overshadowed by **Calm Mind** (which provides offensive pressure by boosting Special Attack alongside Defense), Amnesia is the preferred **Consistency Option** for dedicated "Stall" or "Wall" archetypes that need to reach maximum Special Defense quickly to survive powerful **Nukes** from Special Sweepers. Historically, in Generation I, Amnesia was arguably the most powerful move in the game, as it boosted the "Special" stat, effectively doubling both Special Attack and Special Defense simultaneously.
* **Type Matchups:** While it deals no damage, it is used to neutralize threats from **Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Ice, Psychic,** and **Fairy** types, which primarily utilize Special moves.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; not blocked by Protect (unless targeted by specific items/abilities); not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (167 learners), primarily found among bulky Water-types, Ground-types, and Pokémon with high HP pools.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Snorlax** (to become an impenetrable special wall), **Slowbro** (a classic Gen I staple), and **Quagsire/Clodsire** (where it synergizes with the **Unaware** ability to ignore the opponent's stat changes while stacking its own defenses).
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Volcarona** or **Regice** to transform them into specialized tanks capable of weathering 4x effective or high-powered special hits.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) across multiple generations, including Sword/Shield (TR17) and Scarlet/Violet (TM128).
