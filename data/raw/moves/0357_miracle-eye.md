## Identity & Mechanics
**Miracle Eye** is a **Status Psychic-type** move introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental energy and sharpens its psychic perception to see through illusions and shadows. This enables the user to track even the most elusive foes and bypass the natural mental barriers of Dark-type Pokémon, exposing them to psychic assault.
* **Effect:** Resets the target’s evasion stat to normal and prevents the target from increasing its evasion while it remains on the field. Crucially, it negates the Dark-type's immunity to Psychic-type moves, allowing them to be hit for neutral damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** This move itself ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring it never misses.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 40.
* **Role:** **Niche Utility / Evasion Counter.**
* **Usage:** Miracle Eye serves as the Psychic-type equivalent to *Foresight* and *Odor Sleuth*. In competitive play, it is rarely used because Psychic-types typically prefer to run coverage moves (like *Focus Blast* or *Dazzling Gleam*) to deal with Dark-types directly rather than spending a turn to remove an immunity. However, it can be a "gimmick" counter to **Evasion-stacking** strategies (like Double Team/Minimize) or used in specific "Monotype" formats where a Psychic-type must find a way to damage a Dark-type wall. It allows Psychic moves to deal **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types even if they have a secondary Dark typing (like Drapion or Toxicroak in specific scenarios).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; Not a contact move; Not reflected by Magic Coat (in some generations).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution, restricted almost exclusively to pure or primary Psychic-types (**17 learners**).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly found in the level-up sets of high-tier Psychic threats like **Alakazam**, **Metagross**, and the Legendary **Mewtwo**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by Pokémon like **Sigilyph** and **Xatu** who may use it to ensure their secondary STAB or status moves bypass evasion-heavy opponents. 
* **Acquisition:** Very limited availability; it is primarily learned via **level-up** and has historically never been available as a **TM or TR**, making its presence in the meta extremely rare.
