## Identity & Mechanics
**Reflect** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user manifests a shimmering, translucent wall of psychic energy that reinforces the team's defenses. This barrier acts as a physical buffer, absorbing the impact of incoming strikes and shielding all Pokémon on the user’s side of the field from blunt force and kinetic weaponry.
* **Effect:** Erects a barrier that reduces damage from physical attacks by 50% (1/2) for five turns. In Double Battles, the damage reduction is adjusted to approximately 33% (1/3). The effect lasts for eight turns if the user is holding the **Light Clay** item.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is important to note that **Critical Hits** bypass the damage reduction, and the barrier can be instantly shattered by the moves **Brick Break**, **Psychic Fangs**, or removed via **Defog**.
* **Targeting:** User's Side (Field Effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Screen Setter.
* **Usage:** Reflect is a cornerstone of "Dual Screens" strategies, typically paired with *Light Screen* to provide comprehensive damage mitigation. It is a staple on **Hyper Offense** teams, allowing fragile sweepers to survive hits while setting up. While *Light Screen* handles special attackers, Reflect is the primary answer to powerful physical "Wallbreakers." 
* **Matchups:** Indirectly counters high-attack threats such as **Ground**, **Fighting**, and **Steel** types by halving their damage output.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; remains active even if the user switches out.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution (395 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Grimmsnarl** (who uses the *Prankster* ability to set it with priority), **Mew**, **Tapu Koko**, and **Alakazam**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on high-speed non-Psychic Pokémon like **Dragapult** and **Regieleki**, who use their natural speed to set the barrier before the opponent can land a hit, effectively functioning as "Suicide Leads."
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM33** (Gen 1-7) or **TM18/TR68** in later generations, ensuring almost any team can find a compatible user.
