## Identity & Mechanics
**Stoked Sparksurfer** is a Special Electric-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** After obtaining Z-Power, the user, Alolan Raichu, channels immense electrical energy into its tail to ride it like a surfboard. It surges forward at high speeds, crashing into the target with a massive discharge of lightning. This cinematic attack saturates the battlefield with static, ensuring the opponent is left incapacitated.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. As a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy checks to hit the target unerringly (unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Paralyze the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 175, Accuracy —%, PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** Exclusive Z-Move Nuke / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** This move is the signature Z-Move of Alolan Raichu, requiring it to hold **Aloraichium Z** and know the move **Thunderbolt**. Unlike the generic Electric Z-Move, *Gigavolt Havoc* (which has 175 BP when used with Thunderbolt), Stoked Sparksurfer provides a guaranteed Paralysis secondary effect. This makes it a superior "Panic Button" or Wallbreaker tool, as it ensures that even if the opponent survives the hit, their Speed is halved and they risk losing turns to full paralysis. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Requires a specific Held Item; Cannot be used more than once per battle.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Z-Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Alolan Raichu**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Alolan Raichu is a Dual-type (Electric/Psychic), this move serves as its ultimate STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option, allowing it to bypass its otherwise mediocre bulk by nuking a threat or slowing it down for the rest of the team.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not learned via leveling or TMs; it is accessed only when an Alolan Raichu holding the **Aloraichium Z** crystal uses Thunderbolt. It is primarily featured in *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*.
