## Identity & Mechanics
**Speed Swap** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** The user exerts psychic influence over the field to synchronize and then trade its kinetic momentum with the target. This results in an instantaneous exchange of the user's and target's current Speed stats. Unlike moves that modify stat stages (like Agility), Speed Swap trades the raw, calculated Speed values (including IVs, EVs, and Natures) for the duration of the Pokémon's stay on the field.
* **Effect:** Exchanges the original Speed stats of the user and the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% execution).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Can target allies or opponents; bypasses accuracy/evasion checks).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- | Accuracy —-% | PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Tactical Speed Control / Support Pivot.
* **Usage:** Speed Swap is a niche but devastating tool in **Doubles/VGC** formats. Its primary utility is to "fix" the low speed of a powerful Wallbreaker by having a fast support partner swap their high Speed stat to them. It can also be used offensively to cripple an opponent's fast Sweeper by forcing them to take the user's lower Speed stat. Unlike Trick Room, this effect is localized and cannot be reversed by simply waiting out turns. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and ignores traditional type-effectiveness charts. However, as a Psychic-type move, it can be blocked by certain abilities like *Good as Gold* or specific protection moves like *Crafty Shield*.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not blocked by *Bulletproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (29 total learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic and Bug-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Pheromosa:** The most iconic user due to its naturally massive Speed tier; it can effectively "gift" its speed to a slow ally or ruin an opponent's speed.
    * **Calyrex-Ice:** Often used in conjunction with a faster teammate to overcome its naturally low Speed and become an unstoppable offensive force.
    * **Ribombee:** A common high-speed support user that utilizes Speed Swap to enable teammates in VGC.
    * **Alolan Raichu:** Uses its Surge Surfer-boosted Speed to redistribute momentum across the field.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Porygon-Z** or **Alakazam** as a tech choice to punish faster Choice Scarf users or to support a bulky partner in 2v2 scenarios.
* **Acquisition:** Speed Swap was widely distributed via **TR62** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), allowing many Pokémon to access it through technical records.
