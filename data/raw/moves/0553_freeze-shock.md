## Identity & Mechanics
**Freeze-Shock** is a physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation V (Pokémon Black 2 and White 2).
* **Description:** The user harnesses extreme sub-zero temperatures and condenses them with massive amounts of electrical energy. On the first turn, the user gathers this frozen, high-voltage power; on the second turn, it unleashes a devastating discharge of electrically charged ice shards at the opponent. This move combines the freezing lethality of frost with the disruptive potential of lightning.
* **Effect:** The user charges for one turn before attacking on the second. It deals massive physical damage upon execution.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Paralyze** the target, making it a rare Ice-type move capable of inflicting a status condition usually reserved for Electric moves.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Due to the two-turn charge requirement, Freeze-Shock is rarely used without a **Power Herb** to trigger the attack instantly. In competitive play, it serves as a massive **STAB** nuke for Kyurem-Black, capable of OHKOing many neutral threats. It is often compared to its counterpart, *Ice Burn*, and its viability is frequently weighed against more consistent options like *Icicle Spear* or *Ice Beam*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ground, Flying, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move. It is considered a "charging move" similar to *Sky Attack* or *Solar Beam*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of a specific legendary form (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kyurem-Black**. The move is gained when Kyurem fuses with Zekrom using the DNA Splicers (replacing *Glaciate*).
* **Coverage Utility:** While it has a high paralysis chance (30%), it is rarely seen on sets that cannot afford the item slot for a Power Herb, as the charge turn allows opponents to switch into a resist like a Steel-type or use *Protect*.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is tied strictly to the form-change mechanics of the Tao Trio.
