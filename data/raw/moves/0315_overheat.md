## Identity & Mechanics
**Overheat** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy to exhale or radiate a catastrophic burst of intense, white-hot flames at the target. While it delivers a massive amount of thermal damage instantly, the sheer exertion of the attack exhausts the user’s internal heat reserves, resulting in a significant drop in offensive capability. This move is a premier choice for fire-based "hit-and-run" tactics.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-power special damage to a single target. Immediately following the attack, the user’s Special Attack stat is lowered by two stages (Sharply Lowered).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's Special Attack by 2 stages.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Overheat is the premier "burst" move for Special Attackers. It is frequently compared to **Fire Blast** (more consistent over multiple turns) and **Flamethrower** (lower power but 100% accurate). Overheat is most effective on **Choice Specs** users or Pokémon utilizing an **Eject Pack**, which allows them to pivot out immediately after the stat drop. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Does not have punching or sound-based properties. It is a non-contact, projectile-like special attack.

* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon to bypass Steel-type walls. Notable coverage users include **Manectric**, **Miraidon**, and **Galarian Weezing**, who use it to melt threats like Ferrothorn or Scizor.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM (TM50 in many gens)** or **TR**, appearing in almost every regional dex since its debut in Hoenn.
