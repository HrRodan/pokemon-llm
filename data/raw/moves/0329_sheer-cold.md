## Identity & Mechanics
**Sheer Cold** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user releases a blast of absolute-zero temperature air that instantly freezes the target to its core, resulting in an immediate knockout. This move is the ultimate gamble, representing the lethality of extreme arctic environments. In modern generations, Ice-type Pokémon are immune to this move, and its accuracy is further penalized when used by non-Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Effect:** This is a **One-Hit Knock Out (OHKO)** move. It deals damage equal to the target's maximum HP. It ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers. The move's success depends heavily on level: it will always fail if the user is a lower level than the target. The base accuracy is 30%, increasing by 1% for every level the user is above the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The move results in immediate fainting if it connects).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [OHKO], Accuracy 30%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Sheer Cold is used primarily as a "panic button" or a way to force progress against incredibly bulky defensive walls (like Blissey or Toxapex) that a team otherwise cannot break. Unlike other OHKO moves like *Fissure* or *Guillotine*, Sheer Cold is generally considered the best of its class because no type was immune to it prior to Generation VII. In restricted formats (like VGC) or Battle Facilities, it is a notorious "clutch" move.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage (effectively instant death) to any target it hits, though **Ice-type Pokémon** have been immune to it since Generation VII.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; fails against targets with the **Sturdy** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, primarily restricted to Ice-types and powerful Water-types (26 learners total).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Ice-types such as **Articuno**, **Lapras**, **Walrein**, and **Vanilluxe**. It is also a signature high-pressure move for the Legendary **Kyogre** and the Ruinous Pokémon **Chien-Pao**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by **Suicune** (via special events or specific generations) to threaten counters that it couldn't otherwise damage. **Articuno** is particularly famous for the "Mind Reader + Sheer Cold" combo, which guarantees a hit on the following turn if the opponent does not switch.
* **Acquisition:** Very rare; almost exclusively learned via level-up by high-level Ice Pokémon. It is generally not available as a TM or TR.
