## Identity & Mechanics
**Origin Pulse** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation VI (specifically in *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*).
* **Description:** The user manifests primordial oceanic energy, firing countless beams of shimmering, deep-blue light that erupt from the ground or water's surface to pierce all opponents. This move is the signature attack of the legendary Sea Basin Pokémon, Kyogre, representing its control over the world's oceans.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive special damage to all adjacent opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for secondary status effects).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (ideal for Doubles and VGC formats).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Spread Damage Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Origin Pulse serves as Kyogre's primary STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option when its HP is too low to effectively utilize **Water Spout**. While it suffers from the same 85% accuracy check as **Hydro Pump**, its ability to hit both opponents in Doubles without the power reduction of **Surf** (which hits allies) makes it a premier choice in Restricted formats. It is frequently boosted by Kyogre's **Drizzle** ability (Rain), effectively increasing its base power by 50%. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Pulse-based (boosted by Mega Launcher), though this interaction is rare due to its limited distribution. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, being a signature move restricted to only 2 forms of a single legendary species.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively used by **Kyogre** and its **Primal Kyogre** form.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not utilized by non-Water types for coverage. It is the Water-type counterpart to Groudon's **Precipice Blades**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned by Kyogre upon reaching Level 45 (Gen VI-VIII) or via Move Relearner.
