## Identity & Mechanics
**Tectonic Rage (Special)** is a Special Ground-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** Through the power of Groundium Z, the user manifests the raw, destructive force of shifting tectonic plates. The ground beneath the opponent erupts into a violent, localized earthquake, dragging the target into a massive sinkhole or crushing them between tremors of concentrated earthen energy.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that upgrades a base Special Ground-type move (such as *Earth Power* or *Mud-Slap*). Its Power is determined by the base move, significantly increasing the damage output for a single turn. It bypasses accuracy checks and cannot be fully protected against by moves like *Protect* (dealing 25% chip damage).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Z-Moves generally do not inherit secondary effects of the base move unless specified).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–190], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Tactical Nuke / Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** In the Generation VII competitive meta, Tectonic Rage served as a "one-time-only" solution to bypass traditional defensive checks. A Special attacker using this move can lure in and eliminate bulky Pokémon that would otherwise survive a standard *Earth Power*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power is derived from the base special move (e.g., *Earth Power* results in a 175 BP Tectonic Rage).

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move has **Universal Distribution** among Pokémon that can learn any Special Ground-type move in Generation VII.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Landorus-Therian:** Often utilized a special set with *Earth Power* to surprise physical walls with a massive Special Tectonic Rage.
    * **Nidoking:** Leveraging its *Sheer Force* capabilities, Nidoking used this to secure KOs on Steel-types that resisted its other coverage.
    * **Gastrodon:** Used this to turn its defensive presence into a sudden offensive threat against Heatran or Toxapex.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Heatran** or **Garchomp** (Special/Mixed sets) to provide a high-damage burst against grounded Steel and Poison types.
* **Acquisition:** Available only in Generation VII by equipping a Pokémon with **Groundium Z** while it knows a Special Ground-type move.
