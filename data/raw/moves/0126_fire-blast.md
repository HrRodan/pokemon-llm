## Identity & Mechanics
**Fire Blast** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user launches an intense, multi-pronged burst of white-hot fire shaped like the Japanese kanji for "great" (大). This incinerating blast engulfs the target in a massive conflagration, radiating extreme thermal energy that can melt through Steel-type defenses and scorch the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-magnitude Special damage to a single target. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to Burn the target, which periodically deals damage and halves the victim's Attack stat.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 85%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Special Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Fire Blast is the gold standard for offensive Fire-type coverage. It is chosen over **Flamethrower** when a Pokémon needs to secure specific KOs against bulky threats, trading 15% accuracy for significantly higher damage output. It is often preferred over **Overheat** on sets that intend to stay on the field, as it does not trigger a Special Attack drop. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses certain defensive abilities like *Fluffy* (if making contact, though this is a non-contact special move) and is boosted by **Sun** (Sunny Day/Drought), which increases its damage by 50%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (241 learners), making it one of the most accessible high-power moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) users include **Charizard**, **Heatran**, **Volcarona**, and **Chandelure**.
* **Coverage Utility:** It is a vital coverage tool for non-Fire types to dismantle Steel-type walls. Notable examples include **Garchomp** (to hit Skarmory and Corviknight), **Hydreigon**, **Nidoking**, and **Tyranitar**.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely easy to acquire; it has been available as a **TM (Technical Machine)** in every single generation since the series' inception.
