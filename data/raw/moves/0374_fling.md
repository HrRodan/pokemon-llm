## Identity & Mechanics
**Fling** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user physically hurls its held item at the target with great force. The visual manifestation involves the user launching their equipped tool—ranging from heavy stones to mystical orbs—to inflict damage and potentially transfer the item's properties to the foe. This move is unique as it **consumes the user's held item** upon use, making it a one-time tactical strike.
* **Effect:** Power and secondary effects are determined by the specific item held. For example, an **Iron Ball** provides a massive 130 Power hit, while a **Light Ball** or **Flame Orb** will inflict their respective status conditions. The move fails if the user has no item, is under the effect of *Embargo* or *Magic Room*, or is holding "sticky" items like Mega Stones or Griseous Orbs.
* **Secondary Effect:** Variable. Specific items like the **King's Rock** or **Razor Fang** guarantee a 100% flinch chance, while Orbs/Status berries apply their status effects (Burn, Paralysis, Poison).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Tactical Utility / One-time Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Fling is rarely used for raw damage unless paired with the **Iron Ball** (130 BP). Its primary competitive niche is triggering the ability **Unburden** (doubling Speed after item loss) or spreading guaranteed status. It is often compared to *Knock Off*; while *Knock Off* is more consistent, Fling allows the user to choose a specific detrimental effect to "gift" to the opponent. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. It notably **ignores the Sticky Hold ability**, allowing the user to successfully throw their item even against Pokémon that usually prevent item removal.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (**485 learners**), as almost any Pokémon with limbs or the ability to carry an object can learn to throw it.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Weavile:** Frequently uses Fling (often with a King's Rock or Iron Ball) to utilize its high Attack and STAB while gaining a tactical edge.
    * **Gliscor:** Historically used Fling in conjunction with *Acrobatics* or to pass a *Toxic Orb* once its own *Poison Heal* was activated.
    * **Iron Hands:** Utilizes heavy items to turn Fling into a high-powered Dark-type coverage nuke.
* **Coverage & Utility:** 
    * **Hawlucha & Sneasler:** Often carry Fling as a reliable way to consume their own item and instantly trigger **Unburden**, skyrocketing their Speed tier.
    * **Gengar:** Occasionally uses it with a status-inducing item to cripple physical attackers that it cannot otherwise touch.
* **Acquisition:** Fling is a staple **TM** (Technical Machine) found in every generation since its debut (TM56 in Gen 4, TR37 in Gen 8, TM043 in Gen 9).
