## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Pulse** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user exhales a powerful, mystical shockwave of draconic energy generated from deep within its gaping mouth. This concentrated blast of aura-like force strikes the target with high precision, manifesting as a shimmering purple or multicolored beam of energy.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent Special damage without any positive or negative secondary effects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Dragon Pulse serves as the primary middle-ground option for Special attackers. While it lacks the explosive power of **Draco Meteor**, it does not incur the harsh Special Attack drop, making it the preferred choice for sustained "Wallbreakers" or "Setup Sweepers" who need to remain on the field for multiple turns. In modern formats, it is often compared to **Clanging Scales** or **Dragon Energy**, but remains the gold standard for accuracy and reliability.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types. It is resisted by **Steel** and has no effect on **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Pulse-based move; damage is boosted by 50% for Pokémon with the **Mega Launcher** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (172 learners), being accessible to nearly every Dragon-type and many Pokémon with draconic physiology.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Special attackers like **Latios/Latias**, **Hydreigon**, **Goodra**, **Dialga**, and **Naganadel** frequently run this move to exploit their high Special Attack stats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often utilized by non-Dragon Pokémon such as **Lucario** (Special sets), **Mega Blastoise** (utilizing the Mega Launcher boost), and **Charizard** to hit opposing Dragon-types that otherwise resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (TM59 in Gen 4, TM062 in Gen 9) or **TR** (TR62 in Gen 8) across almost every generation since its debut, making it a staple of competitive teambuilding.
