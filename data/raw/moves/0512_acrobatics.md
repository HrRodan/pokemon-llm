## Identity & Mechanics
**Acrobatics** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user performs a high-speed, agile maneuver, vaulting off the opponent or utilizing their surroundings to strike from an unpredictable angle. By shedding the weight and distraction of a held item, the user gains significant momentum, allowing for a devastatingly powerful blow that punishes foes with extreme precision.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the user is not holding an item, the move’s base power is doubled from 55 to **110**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 55 (110 if no item), Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Setup Sweeper Finisher.
* **Usage:** Acrobatics is a premier Flying-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option, often preferred over **Brave Bird** on specific builds because it lacks recoil damage. At 110 Power, it is one of the strongest reliable physical moves in the game, provided the user can naturally consume or lose their item (e.g., via **Unburden**, **Flying Gem**, or **Booster Energy**). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (224 learners), making it a common sight in both casual and competitive play.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Hawlucha:** The quintessential user, utilizing its *Unburden* ability by consuming a Seed or Herb to double its Speed and the power of Acrobatics simultaneously.
    * **Roaring Moon:** Frequently uses *Booster Energy* to activate its *Protosynthesis* ability; once the energy is consumed, Acrobatics becomes its strongest, recoil-free Flying STAB.
    * **Archeops:** Thematically tied to the move, often relying on its high base Attack to fire off 110-power hits without the self-destructive recoil of Brave Bird.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Flying Pokémon like **Rillaboom** (who can consume a Grassy Seed to trigger the power boost) and **Sneasler** to counter Bug or Fighting-type threats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) across most generations since its debut, ensuring its presence in almost every competitive format.
