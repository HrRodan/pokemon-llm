## Identity & Mechanics
**Water Spout** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user erupts with a massive, pressurized geyser or a colossal pillar of water targeted at the opposing side. To maximize its destructive potential, the user must be in peak physical condition; as the user's stamina wanes, the volume and pressure of the water diminish, resulting in a weaker torrent. This makes it a premier "nuke" for fast Water-types.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the user's current HP. The move's power is calculated as `150 * (Current HP / Max HP)`. At full health, it reaches a staggering 150 Base Power.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150 (Max), Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Water Spout is the most powerful Water-type move available without a recharge turn, provided the user is at full HP. It is the gold standard for **Rain-boosted STAB** damage. It is frequently paired with a **Choice Scarf** to ensure the user moves first before taking damage, or used on **Trick Room** teams with slower, bulkier users. In Doubles/VGC, its status as a **Spread Move** makes it devastatingly efficient at clearing boards. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, Special move. Because it targets all opponents, its damage is reduced by 25% in Double Battles if both targets are still on the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution (10 learners), primarily limited to aquatic Pokémon with large reservoirs of water or legendary status.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Kyogre / Primal Kyogre:** The most iconic user. Combined with the *Drizzle* ability, Kyogre’s Water Spout is one of the most feared attacks in the Uber tier and VGC history.
    * **Blastoise:** Often uses Water Spout in conjunction with *Shell Smash* or as a Gigantamax/Mega threat to overwhelm opponents early in the match.
    * **Wailord:** Uses its massive base HP stat to utilize Water Spout effectively, often in lower-tier competitive brackets or Trick Room.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is almost never seen as a coverage move; it is almost exclusively utilized by Water-type Pokémon for **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus). **Jellicent** occasionally uses it on specialized defensive-offensive hybrid sets.
* **Acquisition:** It is generally a **Level-up** move for its specific learners and is **not available as a TM or TR**, making it a rare and specialized tool.
