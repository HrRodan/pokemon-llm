## Identity & Mechanics
**Double-Slap** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto region).
* **Description:** The user attacks the target by striking it repeatedly with its hands, paws, or flippers. This rapid-fire assault delivers between two and five consecutive hits in a single turn, making it a "multi-hit" move capable of wearing down opponents through volume of strikes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage multiple times. It has a 37.5% (3/8) chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% (1/8) chance to hit 4 or 5 times. On average, the move connects 3 times per use.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though its multi-hit nature allows it to bypass **Substitute**, **Focus Sash**, and the **Sturdy** ability by dealing damage after the initial hit breaks the protection.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15 (per hit), Accuracy 85%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Early-game Multi-hit / Niche Utility.
* **Usage:** Generally considered sub-optimal in competitive play due to its low base power (averaging 45 total) and shaky 85% accuracy. It is significantly outclassed by moves like *Return* or *Body Slam* for consistency, and *Tail Slap* for multi-hit damage. Its primary utility lies in breaking **Substitutes** or **Focus Sashes**, though its low accuracy makes it a "High-Risk, Low-Reward" option.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **Ineffective** against Ghost types and **Resisted** by Rock and Steel types. It does not hit any type for Super Effective damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Static* on every individual hit.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (43 total learners), primarily found among Pokémon with a "cute" or "humanoid" aesthetic.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with the **Clefairy** and **Jigglypuff** lines, as well as the **Chansey/Blissey** and **Audino** families. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen in the level-up pools of non-Normal types like **Poliwrath**, **Mienshao**, and **Salazzle**, though these Pokémon almost always prefer their respective STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves for better damage output.
* **Acquisition:** Double-Slap is notably rare in terms of technical availability; it is **not available as a TM or TR** in any generation, meaning it must be learned through leveling up or as an Egg Move.
