## Identity & Mechanics
**Revenge** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user braces itself against an incoming assault, absorbing the impact before unleashing a devastating retaliatory strike. This move channels the momentum of the opponent's attack, turning their offensive pressure into a powerful counter-blow. Because the user must wait for the opponent to act, it operates at a significantly decreased priority (-4).
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target dealt direct damage to the user during the same turn, the base power of Revenge is doubled from 60 to 120. Indirect damage, such as Pain Split or status conditions, does not trigger this boost.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The power-doubling mechanic is its primary feature).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (120 if damaged), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reactive Wallbreaker / Counter-Attacker.
* **Usage:** Revenge is a niche alternative to more consistent Fighting-type STAB moves like *Close Combat* or *Drain Punch*. It is best utilized by bulky "Tank" archetypes that possess the HP and Defense to survive a hit. While its -4 priority ensures the user moves last, a successful activation results in a 120-power nuke that lacks the defensive drawbacks of *Close Combat*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (125 learners), primarily found among heavy-hitting Physical attackers and Fighting-type specialists.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Machamp**, **Conkeldurr**, and **Buzzwole**, all of whom possess the natural bulk to capitalize on the move's power-doubling mechanic.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Tyranitar**, **Bisharp**, and **Incineroar** to provide crucial Fighting-type coverage against Steel and Rock-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (notably TM42 in Sword & Shield), making it an accessible mid-game or competitive tech option for many Physical bruisers.
