## Identity & Mechanics
**Thousand Waves** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rhythmic, rippling seismic wave that snakes across the earth's surface toward the enemy. This low-frequency vibration ensnares the targets, pinning them to the battlefield and preventing them from being switched out or fleeing. It is one of the signature moves of the Order Pokémon, Zygarde.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and applies a trapping effect to all targets hit. Trapped Pokémon cannot switch out or flee as long as the user remains active on the field (unless the target is a Ghost-type, holds a Shed Shell, or uses a pivoting move like U-turn).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trap the target(s).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Trapping Utility / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** While it has slightly lower raw power than *Earthquake* (100 BP), Thousand Waves is preferred in specific tactical builds. The trapping mechanic is a powerful "Anti-Meta" tool, allowing the user to lock in a passive or disadvantaged opponent to setup with moves like *Coil* or *Dragon Dance*. In Doubles, it acts as a reliable spread move that does not damage the user's teammate. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses effects like King's Shield or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being a signature move of the **Zygarde** line (5 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Zygarde-10%**, **Zygarde-50%**, and **Zygarde-Complete**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Zygarde, it is never seen as non-STAB coverage. However, it is often paired with *Thousand Arrows* to ensure the user can hit Flying-types and then trap the remaining grounded threats.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM/TR. In Generation VII, it is taught via the Zygarde Cube after collecting a specific number of Zygarde Cells; in Generation VIII, it is accessible via the Move Relearner.
