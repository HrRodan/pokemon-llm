## Identity & Mechanics
**Meteor Assault** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user focuses its entire spirit and momentum into a singular, devastating charge, striking the opponent wildly with a massive, lance-like thick leek. The impact is so explosive and the force so immense that the user becomes physically staggered by the recoil, requiring a turn to recover their stance. This move is the signature technique of the noble Galarian knight, Sirfetch'd.
* **Effect:** The move inflicts massive damage on a single target. However, the user must "recharge" on the following turn, during which it cannot attack, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The recharge is a primary mechanic/negative drawback).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Meteor Assault is a high-commitment "finishing move" or a desperation nuke. While its 150 Base Power is staggering, the mandatory recharge turn makes it vulnerable to being "set up on" by the opponent. In competitive play, it is often bypassed in favor of **Close Combat** for consistent damage, but it remains a niche option for securing a KO on a defensive wall that would otherwise survive a weaker hit. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Sirfetch'd**. It represents the pinnacle of the Pokémon's martial prowess after evolving from Galarian Farfetch'd through a display of critical hitting mastery.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it has no coverage utility on other Pokémon. It is essentially the Fighting-type equivalent of Hyper Beam or Giga Impact, tailored specifically for Sirfetch'd’s high Attack stat.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM or TR; it is learned only by Sirfetch'd upon evolution or via the Move Reminder.
