## Identity & Mechanics
**Multi-Attack** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Cloaking its entire body in a shroud of intense, high-frequency energy, the user charges and slams into the target with immense kinetic force. As the signature move of the Synthetic Pokémon Silvally, the elemental properties of this energy shift dynamically based on the "Memory" disc integrated into its RKS System. This allows the move to manifest as any of the 18 elemental types, from searing fire to chilling ice or draconic energy.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The move’s type changes to match the specific **Memory** item held by the user (e.g., a Fire Memory turns the move into a Fire-type attack). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Wallbreaker / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Multi-Attack is the cornerstone of Silvally’s competitive viability. Following its significant Power buff in Generation VIII (from 90 to 120), it functions as a physical equivalent to Arceus's *Judgment*. Unlike other high-power physical moves like *Double-Edge* or *Flare Blitz*, Multi-Attack has no recoil damage, making it an exceptionally safe and spammable **Nuke**. It deals **Super Effective** damage based on the held Memory, effectively allowing Silvally to target the specific weaknesses of an opponent's core (e.g., Fairy-type Multi-Attack to check Dragon-types).
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Unique/Exclusive** distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the signature move of **Silvally**. Because Silvally is the only Pokémon with the **RKS System** ability, it is the only creature capable of utilizing the move's type-shifting mechanic.
* **Coverage Utility:** While the move itself cannot be learned by other Pokémon, Silvally uses it to provide "Internal Coverage." By switching its held Memory in the teambuilder, Silvally can fill almost any offensive gap in a team—acting as a **Ghost-type** spin-blocker, a **Steel-type** fairy-check, or a **Fire-type** steel-breaker.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to any other species; it is learned exclusively by Silvally upon evolution from Type: Null.
