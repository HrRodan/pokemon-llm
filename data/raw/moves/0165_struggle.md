## Identity & Mechanics
**Struggle** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** A desperate, last-resort attack performed when a Pokémon has exhausted all of its available techniques. The user flails wildly, thrashing against the opponent in an attempt to deal damage despite having no remaining energy. Because it is a move of pure desperation, it bypasses all accuracy and evasion checks, ensuring a hit unless the opponent is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig).
* **Effect:** Inflicts **typeless damage**, meaning it ignores the standard type effectiveness table (notably hitting Ghost-types for neutral damage). The user sustains **recoil damage equal to 1/4 (25%) of its own maximum HP**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it possesses unique bypass properties: the recoil cannot be prevented by abilities like **Rock Head** or **Magic Guard**.
* **Targeting:** Random Opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy ∞% (Cannot miss), PP 1.
* **Role:** **Emergency Fail-Safe / "Struggle Stall" Mechanic.**
* **Usage:** Struggle is never selected voluntarily; it is the default action when a Pokémon has 0 PP remaining across all moves or is prevented from using moves via a combination of **Encore**, **Torment**, **Taunt**, or **Disable**. In competitive play, "Struggle Stalling" is a win condition where one player forces the other to deplete their PP until they faint from Struggle recoil.
* **Type Matchups:** As it deals **typeless damage**, it hits all Pokémon—including **Ghost, Rock, and Steel** types—for neutral damage. It cannot deal Super Effective damage.
* **Attributes:** This move is not affected by items like Metronome (the item) and cannot be copied by Mirror Move or Sketch.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Struggle has a **Universal** distribution (virtually every Pokémon in existence can use it).
* **Prominent Contexts:** While no Pokémon "wants" to use Struggle, it is most frequently seen in matches involving extreme **Stall** archetypes. Pokémon like **Blissey**, **Toxapex**, and **Lugia** often find themselves in "PP wars" where the match is decided by who begins Struggling first.
* **Enablers:** Pokémon that force the opponent into a Struggle state include **Sableye** or **Whimsicott** (using Prankster-boosted Encore/Disable/Taunt) and **Pressure** ability users like **Corviknight** or **Suicune** who accelerate PP depletion.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Tutor; it is a hard-coded mechanic triggered automatically by the game engine when no other legal moves can be performed.
