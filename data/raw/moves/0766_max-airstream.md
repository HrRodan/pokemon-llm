## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Airstream** is a [Physical or Special] **Flying**-type move introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A colossal, gale-force strike executed by a Dynamax Pokémon. The user manipulates atmospheric pressure to create a massive vortex that slams the target with hurricane-strength winds. This aerial maneuver streamlines the airflow around the user and its team, significantly reducing air resistance and increasing momentum.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and **raises the Speed stat of the user and its allies** by one stage (1.5x).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to boost Speed.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon; Speed boost affects the user and their partner in Double Battles.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [Always Hits]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Speed Control / Snowballing Sweeper.** 
* **Usage:** Max Airstream is arguably the most dominant mechanic in the Generation VIII competitive meta (VGC and Smogon). While other Max Moves boost defenses or change weather, Max Airstream provides immediate **Speed Control**, allowing a Pokémon to "out-speed" its natural checks mid-turn. It transforms slow, heavy hitters into unstoppable sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power is determined by the Base Power of the move it replaces (typically ranging from 110 to 140 BP).

As a Max Move, it has a **Universal distribution** among any Pokémon that knows a damaging Flying-type move while Dynamaxed.
