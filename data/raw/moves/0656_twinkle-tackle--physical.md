## Identity & Mechanics
**Twinkle Tackle (Physical)** is a Physical Fairy-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** By channeling immense Z-Power through a Fairium Z, the user manifests a whimsical, starlit dimension that ensnares the opponent. The user then toys with the target through a series of magical strikes before delivering a finishing blow. This move is a cinematic, high-energy manifestation of Fairy-type magic designed to overwhelm even the sturdiest foes.
* **Effect:** This move is a **Z-Move**. It can only be used if the trainer possesses a Z-Ring (or Z-Power Ring) and the Pokémon is holding a **Fairium Z** while knowing a physical Fairy-type damaging move (such as Play Rough). Its base power is determined by the power of the original move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, like most Z-Moves, it **bypasses accuracy checks** and can partially penetrate protective moves like Protect or Detect (dealing 25% of the original damage).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–190], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Powered Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Twinkle Tackle serves as a one-time "delete button" used to bypass traditional checks. In the Gen VII competitive meta, it is frequently used to provide physical Fairy-type attackers with a move significantly stronger than *Play Rough* (which has 90 Power and 90% Accuracy), removing the risk of missing while providing enough burst damage to OHKO defensive threats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a physical attack, Z-Moves typically do not make contact unless specified by the base move's properties; however, they are generally treated as independent actions that ignore many standard ability-based deterrents during execution.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move has a **Specialized distribution**, as any Pokémon capable of learning a physical Fairy-type move can utilize it if holding the correct Z-Crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Mimikyu:** The most iconic user of physical Fairy Z-Moves; Twinkle Tackle allows it to capitalize on its *Disguise* ability to safely set up *Swords Dance* and then fire off a massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) nuke.
    * **Tapu Bulu:** Often utilizes this move to break through bulky Grass or Poison-type switch-ins that usually resist its Grass-type attacks.
    * **Azumarill:** Can use Twinkle Tackle to provide a secondary nuke alongside its *Huge Power*-boosted *Aqua Jet* or *Waterfall*.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rare on non-Fairy types, Pokémon like **Mawile** or **Garchomp** (via Move Tutor or specific sets) can technically access this move to surprise **Dragon-type** counters, though it is almost exclusively seen on STAB users.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII games (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon) by obtaining the **Fairium Z** crystal, typically found in the Vast Poni Canyon.
