## Identity & Mechanics
**Trick** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user catches the target off-guard with a deceptive maneuver, forcing an instantaneous exchange of held items. This tactical reshuffle can be used to seize a beneficial tool from the opponent or, more maliciously, to foist a detrimental or restrictive item onto them.
* **Effect:** The user and the target permanently swap held items. The move fails if either Pokémon has the **Sticky Hold** ability, is an Arceus with **Multitype**, or is holding **Mail**. In modern competitive formats, it also fails against Mega Stones, Z-Crystals, or Orbs/Memories held by their respective legendary owners. 
* **Choice Lock Interaction:** If a Pokémon receives a Choice Band, Choice Scarf, or Choice Specs via Trick after it has already moved that turn, it becomes locked into the move it just performed.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Tactical Disruptor / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Trick is a premier utility move used to "Choice-lock" defensive walls. By giving a **Choice Scarf** or **Choice Specs** to a passive tank (like Blissey, Toxapex, or Corviknight), the user effectively neuters their ability to cycle through recovery and utility moves, rendering them nearly useless. It is also used to steal **Leftovers** for longevity or to remove a foe's **Heavy-Duty Boots**. It is the Psychic-type counterpart to the move **Switcheroo**.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage, but it is a vital tool for bypassing the natural bulk of **Normal**, **Fairy**, and **Steel** type walls that otherwise resist or ignore the user's STAB attacks.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (though it has a base 100% accuracy); blocked by **Protect** and **Substitute**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (220 learners), primarily among Psychic, Ghost, and mischievous Dark or Fairy types.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Rotom (all forms)**, **Alakazam**, **Latios/Latias**, and **Gengar**.
* **Coverage & Utility Users:** Frequently utilized by **Gholdengo** to cripple checks, **Grimmsnarl** (often paired with the **Prankster** ability for priority Tricking), and **Meowscarada** to disrupt opposing leads. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely accessible as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in Generations VIII and IX, making it a staple "fourth move" on many competitive special attackers.
