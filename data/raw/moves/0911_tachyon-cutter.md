## Identity & Mechanics
**Tachyon Cutter** is a Special Steel-type move introduced in Generation IX (The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero).
* **Description:** The user manipulates tachyons—hypothetical particles that move faster than light—to manifest and launch dual blades of futuristic energy at the target. Because these projectiles transcend standard temporal constraints, the attack distorts the battlefield's space-time, ensuring the blades strike the opponent regardless of their speed or evasive maneuvers.
* **Effect:** This is a multi-hit move that strikes the target **twice** in a single turn. Each hit calculates damage separately, and the move is guaranteed to hit, bypassing all accuracy and evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance). However, its multi-hit nature allows it to bypass **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, and the **Multiscale** ability.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (per hit), Accuracy —% (Never Misses), PP 10.
* **Role:** Precision Multi-Hit STAB / Focus Sash Breaker.
* **Usage:** With a functional Base Power of **100** (50 x 2), Tachyon Cutter is a superior alternative to *Flash Cannon* for special attackers. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to punish "Cheese" strategies involving Evasion (Minimize) and to effectively "double-tap" targets holding a Focus Sash or those behind a Substitute. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a "Cutter" move by name, it is a **Special** attack; it is categorized as a **Slicing Move**, meaning its power is boosted by the ability **Sharpness** (though its primary user utilizes Quark Drive).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner), serving as a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Iron Crown** (the Paradox relative of Cobalion). It serves as its primary Steel-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, benefiting significantly from the Special Attack boost provided by **Quark Drive** in Electric Terrain.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not currently found on other Pokémon. In the competitive meta, it is the premier tool for Iron Crown to threaten **Fairy-type** threats like Flutter Mane, Enamorus, and Clefable, as the guaranteed hit negates any potential accuracy-lowering shenanigans.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned by Iron Crown through leveling up.
