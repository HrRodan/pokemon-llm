## Identity & Mechanics
**Frost Breath** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user exhales a concentrated, freezing blast of sub-zero air at the target. This chilling breath is so precise and intense that it finds the target's weakest point every time, ensuring maximum impact regardless of the opponent's defensive posture.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is hard-coded to **always result in a critical hit** (assuming the move connects and the target is not protected by abilities like Shell Armor or Battle Armor).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% Critical Hit rate. This allows the move to bypass the target's positive Special Defense/Evasion stat stages and the user's negative Special Attack stat stages.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (Effective Power 90), Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Setup-Ignoring Attacker / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Frost Breath is often compared to **Ice Beam**. While both have an effective power of 90, Frost Breath’s niche lies in its ability to ignore a foe's defensive setup (like Calm Mind or Amnesia). However, its 90% accuracy makes it slightly less reliable than Ice Beam's 100%. It is a specialized tool for Pokémon that need to punish defensive boosters. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Flying, Ground, Grass, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not affected by Iron Barbs or Rocky Helmet. It is particularly effective in formats where stat-boosting is prevalent.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (43 learners), primarily focused on Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) users like **Articuno**, **Glaceon**, **Vanilluxe**, and **Froslass**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ice Pokémon such as **Toxapex**, **Araquanid**, and **Golisopod**. These Pokémon use Frost Breath to catch Grass or Flying types off-guard, especially in tiers where their physical movepool might be walled.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM79** in Generations V, VI, and VII, making it accessible to a variety of Pokémon during those eras.
