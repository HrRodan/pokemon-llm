## Identity & Mechanics
**Throat Chop** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user delivers a precise, crushing blow to the target's throat, causing physical trauma that renders them unable to scream or emit vocalizations. This strike effectively silences the opponent, disrupting any strategy reliant on acoustics or vocalized commands for a duration of two turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and prevents the target from using any sound-based moves (such as Hyper Voice, Boomburst, or Torch Song) for two turns.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the "Throat Chop" silence status effect.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Utility Tech.
* **Usage:** While it shares the same base power as **Crunch**, Throat Chop is chosen specifically to hard-counter "Sound" mechanics. In VGC and Singles, it is a vital tool to shut down **Sylveon's Pixilate Hyper Voice**, **Skeledirge's Torch Song**, and **Toxtricity's Boomburst**. Crucially, it also blocks **Parting Shot**, preventing opponents from pivoting out while lowering stats, and stops **Roar** from phasing out setup sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet, and is boosted by the **Tough Claws** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (213 learners), making it one of the most accessible physical Dark-type coverage options in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly favored by **Incineroar** (to shut down opposing Parting Shots), **Weavile**, **Kingambit**, and **Meowscarada** as a reliable STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike**, **Sceptile**, and **Annihilape** to provide vital coverage against Ghost-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII and IX, ensuring most physical attackers with claws, hands, or blade-like appendages can utilize it.
