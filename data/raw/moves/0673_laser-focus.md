## Identity & Mechanics
**Laser Focus** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user enters a state of extreme mental clarity and heightened perception, meticulously analyzing the target's physical structure to identify fatal vulnerabilities. By channeling this intense concentration, the user ensures that their very next offensive maneuver strikes with surgical precision, bypassing standard defenses.
* **Effect:** The move guarantees that the user's next attack will result in a **Critical Hit**, provided it connects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, because it guarantees a critical hit, the subsequent move will ignore the target's positive defensive stat stages (e.g., Defense/Special Defense boosts) and the user's own negative offensive stat stages (e.g., Attack/Special Attack drops from Intimidate or move side-effects).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** Utility / Wallbreaker Setup.
* **Usage:** Laser Focus is a niche setup option used to dismantle "Cosmic Power" or "Iron Defense" stallers. While **Focus Energy** provides a permanent increase to critical hit ratios, Laser Focus is a one-turn guarantee. It is most effectively paired with high-power moves that have recharge turns or stat-dropping side effects (like Overheat or Draco Meteor), as the critical hit ignores the resulting stat drops. It also bypasses the damage reduction of **Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil**.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is blocked by **Taunt**.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, mental-based status move. It does not check accuracy and will always succeed unless the user is Taunted or under the effect of certain Room conditions.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (246 learners), reflecting its nature as a technique of mental discipline available to a vast array of species.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with high-precision or tactical Pokémon such as **Kartana**, **Lucario**, and **Gallade**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Zeraora** or **Bisharp** in specific formats to punish opponents who rely on Defense-boosting moves to check physical attackers. 
* **Acquisition:** It was prominently featured as a **Move Tutor** move in *Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon* and *Pokémon Sword & Shield* (via the Isle of Armor), making it accessible to nearly any Pokémon capable of "focusing."
