## Identity & Mechanics
**Perish Song** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user intones a haunting, melancholic melody that marks the end of all who hear it. This spectral sound fills the battlefield, placing a "Perish Count" on every active Pokémon. It is a high-utility psychological tool used to force switches or seal a victory when the opponent is down to their last few team members.
* **Effect:** Every Pokémon currently on the field receives a counter that starts at 3. At the end of each turn, including the turn the move was used, the counter decreases by 1. When a Pokémon's counter reaches zero, it faints immediately. The effect is removed if a Pokémon switches out, but the counter is maintained if passed via **Baton Pass**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, as a **Sound-based move**, it is completely negated by Pokémon with the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Targeting:** All Pokémon (hits the user, allies, and all foes).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Win-Condition / Stallbreaker / Timer.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the "Perish Trap" archetype. Unlike standard phasing moves like *Roar* or *Whirlwind*, Perish Song puts a definitive clock on the match. It is most effective when paired with trapping abilities or moves (e.g., **Shadow Tag**, **Mean Look**, or **Whirlpool**) to prevent the opponent from switching out to reset the timer. In VGC (Doubles), it serves as a powerful endgame tool—if you have more Pokémon remaining than your opponent, you can trigger Perish Song and use stall tactics (Protect, Substitute, Fly/Dig) to guarantee a win. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it ignores type effectiveness but fails against targets with the **Soundproof** ability. It bypasses **Substitute**.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based; ignores Accuracy/Evasion modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (32 total learners), concentrated among Ghost-types, Water-types, and Pokémon with musical or mythical themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Politoed** (a staple of Perish Trap teams), **Gengar** (especially its Mega Evolution due to Shadow Tag), and **Lapras**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** In modern competitive formats (Gen 9), the Paradox Pokémon **Flutter Mane** and **Scream Tail** frequently utilize Perish Song as a disruptive tool to force out setup sweepers or to close out games in 2v2 scenarios. **Primarina** also utilizes it as a bulky utility option.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via Level-up or as an Egg Move; it is rarely available as a TM, making its presence on a team highly predictable but difficult to stop without specific counters.
