## Identity & Mechanics
**Psychic Fangs** is a Physical Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user manifests psionic energy into a set of ethereal, sharpened teeth to deliver a crushing bite. This mental assault is powerful enough to physically shatter telekinetic barriers and light-based fortifications, neutralizing the opponent's defensive setups.
* **Effect:** This move automatically destroys **Light Screen**, **Reflect**, and **Aurora Veil** on the target’s side of the field before calculating and dealing damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance), but its utility lies in its guaranteed barrier-clearing properties.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / **Utility Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Psychic Fangs is the premier physical Psychic-type choice for consistency. It is frequently compared to *Zen Headbutt*; while it lacks the flinch chance, it offers higher base power (85 vs 80), perfect accuracy, and the niche ability to punish "Screen" cores (like Grimmsnarl or Alolan Ninetales). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Biting move**, meaning its damage is boosted by 50% when used by a Pokémon with the **Strong Jaw** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (84 learners), primarily spread across predatory Pokémon and those with canine or draconic features.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Bruxish:** Its signature move in Gen VII; combined with the *Strong Jaw* ability, it becomes a devastating STAB nuke.
    * **Metagross:** Often prefers this over Zen Headbutt for the 100% accuracy and the ability to break screens for its teammates.
    * **Zacian-Crowned:** Frequently carries this in Ubers for reliable Psychic-type coverage and to bypass defensive utility.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Arcanine (Hisuian & Johtonian)**, **Salamence**, and **Dragapult** to provide essential coverage against Poison-types or bulky Fighting-types like Great Tusk or Iron Valiant.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple coverage option in the modern VGC and Smogon metagames.
