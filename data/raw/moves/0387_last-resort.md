## Identity & Mechanics
**Last Resort** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user focuses its remaining energy into a final, devastating blow. This move is a strategic "finisher" that can only be executed once the user has successfully exhausted every other tool in its current moveset. In visual terms, the user often charges with overwhelming force, symbolizing a desperate, all-or-nothing offensive.
* **Effect:** This move can only be used if each of the user’s other known moves has been used at least once since the user switched into the field. If the user only knows Last Resort, or if any other move remains unused, the attack will fail.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / **Late-Game Finisher**.
* **Usage:** While its Power is massive—surpassing even *Double-Edge* without the recoil—its restrictive condition makes it difficult to slot into standard builds. It is most effectively used in "Minimalist Sets" where a Pokémon carries only two moves: a utility move (like *Fake Out* or *Protect*) and Last Resort. This allows the user to satisfy the move's requirement in a single turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, but serves as a massive neutral hit against anything that isn't **Rock, Steel, or Ghost**.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, making it subject to effects like *Rough Skin*, *Rocky Helmet*, or *King's Shield*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (174 learners), primarily concentrated among Normal-types and "cute" or "mystical" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Ambipom:** The premier user of the "Fake Out + Last Resort" strategy, utilizing high Speed to flinch the opponent before spamming a 140-power STAB nuke.
    * **Sylveon/Eeveelutions:** Often seen in niche sets; Eevee specifically utilizes this move as the base for its unique Z-Move, *Extreme Evoboost*.
    * **Lopunny:** Similar to Ambipom, it uses its high Speed and access to *Fake Out* to enable early usage.
    * **Snorlax:** Can utilize it in Curse sets once it has exhausted its setup and recovery moves.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon like **Dragapult** or **Luxray**, though it is rarely used for coverage due to the strict mechanical requirement that disrupts typical "Four-Attack" coverage sets.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through **Level Up** or **Move Tutors** in various regions; it is rarely available as a TM/TR.
