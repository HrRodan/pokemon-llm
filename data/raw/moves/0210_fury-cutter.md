## Identity & Mechanics
**Fury Cutter** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user slashes the target with sharp claws, scythes, or appendages in a rapid, repetitive motion. Each successful strike allows the user to find a rhythm, increasing the momentum and force of subsequent attacks. If the user is interrupted by a miss or leaves the battlefield, this momentum is lost, and the power resets.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. The power of the move doubles each time it is used successfully (whether consecutively or not), capping at 16x its base power (maxing out at 160 power in modern generations). 
* **Secondary Effect:** The power resets to its base value if the move misses or the user switches out.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 95%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Snowballing Sweeper / Niche Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While generally considered a high-risk option due to its low initial base power and imperfect accuracy, it is a **Slashing** move that benefits from specific abilities. It is often compared to **X-Scissor** (for reliability) or **Leech Life** (for sustain). In a competitive vacuum, it is rarely used unless paired with the ability **Technician** (to boost the initial hits) or **Sharpness** (to boost every hit). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic,** and **Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Slicing/Slashing** move, making it compatible with the Sharpness ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (170 learners), appearing in the movepools of many Pokémon with claws or blades.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Scizor:** Highly effective when paired with the *Technician* ability, which boosts the base power of the first few hits to 60.
    * **Kleavor:** Gains a massive 1.5x damage boost on every hit due to the *Sharpness* ability.
    * **Samurott (Hisuian):** Frequently utilizes this move as a STAB option that scales rapidly alongside *Sharpness*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Bug types like **Garchomp**, **Sceptile**, or **Zangoose** in casual or restricted formats to provide a scaling answer to Psychic or Dark types.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as **TM05** in Generation II, it has remained a common move via level-up and Move Tutor across the series.
