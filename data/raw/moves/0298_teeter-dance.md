## Identity & Mechanics
**Teeter Dance** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user performs a wobbly, erratic, and rhythmic dance that disorients everyone in its vicinity. By moving in an unpredictable, stumbling fashion, the user disrupts the focus of all other Pokémon on the battlefield, inducing a state of chaotic bewilderment.
* **Effect:** Causes the **Confusion** status condition to all adjacent Pokémon. In Double or Triple Battles, this move targets all Pokémon on the field except for the user, including allies.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to inflict Confusion).
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Area of Effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Crowd Control / Disruption Utility.
* **Usage:** Teeter Dance serves as a strictly superior version of *Confuse Ray* or *Sweet Kiss* in Single Battles due to its perfect accuracy and lack of immunities (it can affect Ghost-types). In competitive Doubles, it is a high-risk, high-reward move; while it provides massive disruption, it requires the user's partner to have the **Own Tempo** ability or use **Protect** to avoid self-sabotage. It is often compared to *Swagger*, but preferred when the player does not want to risk boosting the opponent's Attack stat.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it ignores traditional type effectiveness and can confuse any Pokémon not protected by specific Abilities (like **Own Tempo**) or held items (like **Lum Berry** or **Persim Berry**).
* **Attributes:** Classified as a **Dance Move**, meaning it can be copied by the Ability **Dancer** (Oricorio) and is redirected/blocked by certain niche mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (26 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with "dancing" motifs or erratic behavioral themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Spinda** (the move's most thematic representative), **Ludicolo**, **Tsareena**, and **Lilligant**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Meloetta** and **Oricorio** (all forms), where it synergizes with their unique abilities and aesthetic. It is also a staple disruption tool for the **Mr. Mime** family.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is limited; it is primarily learned via Level Up or as an Egg Move. Notably, it is **not** available as a TM or TR in any generation, making its presence in a kit highly predictable once the Pokémon is identified.
