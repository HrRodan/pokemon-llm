## Identity & Mechanics
**Black Hole Eclipse (Physical)** is a Physical Dark-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Powered by Darkinium Z, the user manifests a localized singularity of absolute shadow. The user gathers overwhelming dark energy through its Z-Power, creating a gravitational rift that forcibly sucks the target into a collapsing void of darkness, crushing them with immense pressure.
* **Effect:** This is a specialized Z-Move that upgrades a base Physical Dark-type move. It inflicts massive damage based on the power of the original move (e.g., a base move like *Knock Off* or *Crunch* determines the final output). Like most Z-Moves, it bypasses accuracy checks and cannot be fully blocked by *Protect* or *Detect* (dealing 25% chip damage through shields).
* **Secondary Effect:** None; however, it ignores the secondary effects of the base move it replaces.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100-200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** One-Time Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats (SM/USUM) to delete a specific threat or punch through a defensive wall that would otherwise stall out the user. Because it is a Dark-type move, it provides a high-powered solution against bulky Psychic and Ghost types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; power scales with the base move; ignores accuracy modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
While the raw data lists 0 natural learners, this move is accessible to **any Pokémon** capable of using a Physical Dark-type move while holding a **Darkinium Z** crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Tyranitar:** Frequently used a *Crunch*-based Black Hole Eclipse to OHKO neutral targets or significantly dent physical walls.
    * **Bisharp:** Utilized this move to bypass the stat-lowering drawback of certain moves or to secure a KO on a predicted switch.
    * **Incineroar:** Though it has its signature *Malicious Moonsault*, it occasionally opted for the standard Darkinium Z if specialized sets were required.
    * **Weavile:** Used the move to provide a high-power burst that its standard kit (which relies on lower-BP moves like *Icicle Crash* or *Knock Off*) usually lacks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on high-attack Physical attackers like **Landorus-Therian** or **Mew** when running *Knock Off* to surprise and eliminate specific defensive checks like *Cresselia* or *Slowbro*.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Darkinium Z** Z-Crystal, obtained in the Alola region after completing the trial at Malie Garden.
