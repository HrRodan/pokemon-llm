## Identity & Mechanics
**Muddy Water** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user attacks by launching a massive wave of murky water and thick sediment at the opposition. This deluge of muck is designed to obscure the vision of enemies, creating a hazardous environment that makes it difficult for targets to land their own attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to lower the target’s Accuracy by one stage.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Spread Damage Dealer / Utility Nuke.
* **Usage:** Muddy Water is a staple in Doubles and VGC formats. It serves as the primary alternative to **Surf**; while it has lower accuracy (85% vs 100%), it does not damage the user's ally. Compared to **Hydro Pump**, it offers lower single-target damage but compensates with multi-target pressure and a high 30% chance to cripple the opponent's accuracy, which can swing matches by forcing misses. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is not blocked by "Bulletproof" but is countered by "Storm Drain" or "Water Absorb."

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (114 learners), primarily found among Water-types and Pokémon associated with swamps or draconic traits.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Swampert** line (its original signature-style move), **Kyogre**, **Tapu Fini**, and **Gastrodon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Goodra** (including Hisuian form), **Kingdra**, and **Clodsire** to provide essential Water-type coverage against Ground and Fire types.
* **Acquisition:** It has become more accessible in recent generations, appearing as **TM45** in Sword/Shield and **TM103** in Scarlet/Violet.
