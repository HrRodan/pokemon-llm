## Identity & Mechanics
**Springtide Storm** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus) as the signature move for the Forces of Nature's fourth member.
* **Description:** The user conjures a localized, pink-hued cyclone composed of conflicting emotional energies—love and hate—to batter the opposition. As one of the "Storm" series moves (alongside Bleakwind, Wildbolt, and Sandsear Storm), it represents the turbulent atmospheric power of a legendary deity.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to all adjacent opponents. In Rainy weather, this move bypasses accuracy checks to hit 100% of the time.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to trigger an additional effect based on the user's form:
    * **Incarnate Form:** 30% chance to lower the target's Attack stat by one stage.
    * **Therian Form:** 30% chance to lower the target's Special Attack stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 80%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Spread Attacker.
* **Usage:** Springtide Storm serves as a high-powered Fairy-type alternative to *Moonblast* or *Dazzling Gleam*. While its accuracy is shaky (80%), its high base power and ability to hit multiple targets make it a devastating **Spread STAB** option in VGC and Double Battles. It is particularly potent in **Rain Teams**, where its accuracy becomes perfect, allowing Enamorus to punish Dark, Fighting, and Dragon types without the risk of missing.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a Wind-based move (interacts with the Wind Rider ability) and is the signature move of Enamorus.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), being the exclusive signature move of the Love-Hate Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized exclusively by **Enamorus-Incarnate** (who favors the Attack drop for physical attackers) and **Enamorus-Therian** (who utilizes its higher bulk and Special Attack drop to wall special threats).
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not found on other Pokémon; however, Enamorus functions as a premier Fairy-type **Wallbreaker** specifically to check threats like Great Tusk, Koraidon, and Urshifu-Single-Strike.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it must be learned naturally by Enamorus through leveling up or the Move Tutor in its debut region.
