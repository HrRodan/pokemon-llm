## Identity & Mechanics
**Poison Fang** is a Physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user sinks its venom-drenched fangs into the target, delivering a sharp, piercing bite. This attack focuses on injecting potent toxins directly into the opponent's bloodstream, potentially inflicting a debilitating, long-term status condition. It is classified as a "biting" move, benefiting from specific ability-based power boosts.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage with a high probability of severe poisoning.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to **Badly Poison** the target (Toxic status). Unlike standard poisoning, the damage from Bad Poisoning increases every turn.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility Physical Attacker / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Poison Fang is valued for its 50% chance to inflict the **Toxic** status while bypassing *Taunt*, making it a reliable way to put defensive walls on a timer. It is often compared to **Poison Jab**; while Poison Jab offers more raw power (80 BP), Poison Fang provides superior utility through its severe status infliction. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is categorized as a **Biting move**, meaning its power is increased by 50% (to 75 BP) when used by a Pokémon with the **Strong Jaw** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (29 total learners), primarily restricted to serpentine, canine, or predatory Pokémon with prominent fangs.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Crobat**, **Arbok**, **Seviper**, and the Loyal Three member **Okidogi**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Often utilized by **Mega Mawile** and **Mega Sharpedo** due to their **Strong Jaw** ability (or Strong Jaw in base forms like **Tyrunt**), turning this utility move into a respectable mid-tier damage option that threatens Fairy-type switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through level-up and Egg Moves; it is notably absent from most TM/TR lists, making its presence in a moveset highly character-specific.
