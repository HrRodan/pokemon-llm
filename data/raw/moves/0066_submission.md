## Identity & Mechanics
**Submission** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user seizes the target in a powerful grappling hold and slams them into the ground with overwhelming force, sacrificing its own safety to ensure impact. This Kanto-era technique is characterized by its brute-force approach to wrestling, often involving a body-slamming motion that results in significant kickback to the user.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage. The user receives recoil damage equal to 25% (1/4) of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 80%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** High-Risk Physical STAB / Early-Game Nuke.
* **Usage:** Historically, Submission was the premier Fighting-type move in Generation I, but it has since been heavily outclassed by more reliable options like **Close Combat** (higher power/accuracy) or **Drain Punch** (sustain). Its low 80% accuracy makes it a liability in high-stakes competitive play, often referred to as a "coin-flip" move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (61 learners), primarily consisting of Pokémon with humanoid or muscular physiques capable of grappling.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with **Machamp**, **Poliwrath**, and **Hitmonlee**. In later generations, it is utilized by **Hawlucha** and **Grapploct**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a flavor or niche coverage option on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Pinsir** or **Nidoking** to punish Rock and Steel-type switch-ins in lower-tier formats.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM17** in the original Red, Blue, and Yellow versions, but its availability as a technical machine has significantly diminished in modern titles, appearing more frequently as a natural level-up move.
