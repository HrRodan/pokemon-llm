## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Energy** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** The user converts its very life-force and draconic essence into a massive, radiating wave of power that engulfs the battlefield. As a vitality-based attack, the intensity of the draconic surge is directly tied to the user's physical condition; at peak health, it releases a catastrophic explosion of energy, but the output weakens significantly as the user sustains damage.
* **Effect:** This move deals damage based on the user's current HP. The power is calculated using the formula: `150 × (Current HP / Max HP)`. At full health, it reaches its maximum potential of 150 Base Power.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150 (Max), Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** HP-Dependent Spread Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Dragon Energy is the Dragon-type equivalent of *Water Spout* and *Eruption*. It is designed to be used by fast attackers or under Trick Room to ensure the user moves first while at maximum HP. Its primary rival is *Draco Meteor*; while Dragon Energy lacks the Special Attack drop of Draco Meteor, it becomes significantly less reliable once the user has taken chip damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Does not make contact. Not a pulse or ball/bomb move. Benefits from **Dragon's Maw** (Regidrago's ability), further amplifying its nuclear damage potential.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of a specific Legendary Pokémon (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Regidrago**. Because of Regidrago's massive HP stat and its ability *Dragon's Maw*, a full-health Dragon Energy is one of the hardest-hitting unboosted moves in the entire game.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on other Pokémon. However, it is a primary target for **Smeargle** via Sketch in formats where Smeargle is permitted, allowing for a niche Dragon-type spread nuke.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned by Regidrago through leveling up.
