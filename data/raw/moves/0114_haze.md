## Identity & Mechanics
**Haze** is a Status Ice-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user exhales a chilling, thick black mist or a swirling white fog that blankets the entire battlefield. This mystical vapor permeates the air, neutralizing magical and physical enhancements alike to return all combatants to their base state. It is a premier "reset button" used to stabilize a chaotic match.
* **Effect:** Resets the stat stages (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion) of every Pokémon on the field to zero. This "reset" is mechanically distinct from a "stat reduction," meaning it does not trigger abilities like **Defiant**, **Competitive**, **Clear Body**, or **Mirror Armor**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the entire field (all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** **Setup Stopper / Anti-Sweeper Utility.**
* **Usage:** Haze is a vital defensive tool used to shut down "Set-up Sweepers" who rely on moves like Dragon Dance, Quiver Dance, or Calm Mind. Unlike **Roar** or **Whirlwind**, Haze is not affected by the "Suction Cups" ability or "Ingrain," and it works against a Pokémon behind a **Substitute**. It is often compared to **Clear Smog**; while Haze lacks chip damage, it is superior because it cannot be blocked by Steel-types or the "Bulletproof" ability.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage, but as an Ice-type move, it can be utilized by Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability (via Copycat or similar mechanics) to gain priority.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Substitute**. Not a contact move. Not blocked by **Protect** in most generations (though it affects the user's side regardless).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (126 learners), appearing primarily on Water, Poison, and Ghost-type Pokémon despite its Ice-type classification.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Toxapex:** The most iconic user in modern competitive play, utilizing Haze to prevent itself from being used as "setup fodder" while it stalls with Toxic.
    * **Milotic:** Often uses Haze to complement its natural bulk and stop special attackers from boosting past its defenses.
    * **Tapu Fini:** A premier defensive utility choice in previous VGC/Smogon formats to reset field stats.
    * **Vaporeon / Articuno:** Classic Kanto users that utilize the move to maintain their role as walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on fast utility Pokémon like **Gengar** or **Greninja** as a niche tech to stop an opponent's sweep in an emergency.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a level-up or egg move, it has become widely accessible as a **TM** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
