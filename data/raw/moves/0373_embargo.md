## Identity & Mechanics
**Embargo** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user casts a restrictive field over the target, placing a prohibition on their possessions. This mystical suppression prevents the target from utilizing the benefits of their held item, effectively rendering equipment like Life Orbs, Choice items, or Berries useless for the duration. In a casual or playthrough setting, it also prevents the opposing Trainer from using items (like Full Restores) on that specific Pokémon.
* **Effect:** The target is prevented from using its held item for five turns. While under this effect, if the target uses **Fling**, the move will fail. If the target uses **Bug Bite** or **Pluck** on a Pokémon holding a Berry, the Berry is destroyed without the target gaining its benefits.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Status move). However, the effect can be passed to a teammate via **Baton Pass**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Item Suppression.
* **Usage:** Embargo is a niche disruption tool used to neutralize specific item-dependent strategies. While largely outclassed by **Knock Off** (which removes the item permanently and deals damage) or **Trick/Switcheroo** (which swaps items), Embargo has the unique advantage of not being blocked by the **Sticky Hold** ability. It is used to temporarily disable **Eviolite** on defensive walls, **Choice Scarves** on revenge killers, or **Focus Sashes** on leads. As a Status move, it does not deal damage and therefore has no **Super Effective** matchups, but it can be blocked by **Magic Coat** or **Magic Bounce**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect/Detect** if used by a Pokémon with the **Infiltrator** ability (depending on generation/context), but generally blocked by standard protection. As a Dark-type move, it cannot affect Dark-type opponents when used by a Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, with 118 Pokémon capable of learning it, primarily through TMs.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Dark and Ghost types such as **Darkrai**, **Gengar**, **Mewtwo**, and **Alakazam** have historically utilized this move for disruption.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon like **Murkrow** (utilizing the **Prankster** ability for priority item suppression) or **Malamar** to shut down specific counters in lower tiers.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM63** in most games from Generation IV through Generation VII. It was notably removed from the move pool of many Pokémon in Generation VIII and beyond as the "Item Suppression" niche was condensed into other mechanics.
