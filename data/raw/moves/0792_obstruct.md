**## Identity & Mechanics**
**Obstruct** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user assumes a daunting, intimidating stance, bracing itself against incoming strikes. By shouting or physically blocking the opponent's path, the user creates an absolute barrier. This move is designed not just for safety, but to intimidate and unsettle opponents who dare to make physical contact, leaving their guard wide open.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all effects of moves that target them during that turn. Like *Protect*, its success rate drops by 50% for each consecutive use of a protection-based move. Unlike standard protection moves, if an attacker makes **direct contact** with the user while Obstruct is active, the attacker’s **Defense stat is harshly lowered**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the attacker’s Defense by **two stages (-2)** upon contact.
* **Targeting:** Affects the User (Priority +4).

**## Competitive Profile**
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Strategic Protection / Defensive Punisher.
* **Usage:** Obstruct functions as a superior version of *Protect* for its users. While *King's Shield* (Aegislash) lowers the opponent's Attack, Obstruct lowers **Defense**. This creates a "forced opening" scenario; after the opponent hits into Obstruct, they become much more vulnerable to the user's next Physical attack (like *Facade* or *Night Slash*). It is exceptionally effective against physical attackers and "Contact" move users (e.g., *U-turn*, *Close Combat*, *Liquidation*).
* **Context:** It deals **indirect utility** against all types, but is most dangerous when used to soften up bulky Steel or Rock types for a follow-up Physical hit.
* **Attributes:** Priority +4; Bypassed by "Unseen Fist" or moves like *Feint*.

**## Distribution & Notable Users**
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of its evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Obstagoon**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on other Pokémon. On Obstagoon, it is almost mandatory, as it allows the Pokémon to safely trigger its **Flame Orb** (to activate the *Guts* ability) while simultaneously punishing opponents who try to lead with a physical strike.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned strictly via evolution or leveling up within the Obstagoon line.
