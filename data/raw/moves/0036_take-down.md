## Identity & Mechanics
**Take-Down** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lunges forward with a reckless, full-body charge, slamming into the target with immense momentum. The force of the impact is so great that the user cannot fully absorb the kinetic energy, resulting in significant self-inflicted recoil damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage. The user sustains recoil damage equal to 25% (1/4) of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** High-Risk Physical Attacker / Early-game Heavy Hitter.
* **Usage:** Take-Down occupies a difficult niche in competitive play. While its 90 Power is respectable for mid-game progression, it is almost universally outclassed by **Return** (102 Power, 100% Accuracy, no recoil) or **Double-Edge** (120 Power, 100% Accuracy, same recoil percentage). Its 85% Accuracy makes it unreliable in high-stakes matches, often leading to costly misses. It is most frequently seen in "Little Cup" formats or during the main-story playthrough before better TMs are available.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it provides neutral coverage against most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution, with **848** different Pokémon capable of learning the move through leveling or TM.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Physical attackers such as **Tauros**, **Arcanine**, **Snorlax**, and the final evolutions of the Kanto starters (**Venusaur**, **Charizard**, and **Blastoise**) are frequently associated with this move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its massive distribution, it is found on a vast array of non-Normal types including **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, and **Luxray**, typically serving as a placeholder Physical STAB or neutral coverage move during early levels.
* **Acquisition:** Historically a staple TM (TM09 in Gen I) and has returned as a craftable/findable TM in Generation IX (**TM001** in Scarlet & Violet), marking it as one of the first "power" moves a trainer typically acquires.
