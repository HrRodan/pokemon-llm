## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Rockfall** is a Physical Rock-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A colossal manifestation of earthen power used exclusively by Dynamaxed Pokémon. The user calls down a torrential downpour of massive boulders and jagged stones from the sky to crush the target. The impact is so violent that it kicks up a lingering **Sandstorm** that scours the battlefield for five turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the power of the underlying base move and replaces the current weather with a Sandstorm.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to summon a **Sandstorm** upon successful use.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 110–150], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Weather Setter** and **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Max Rockfall is a cornerstone of "Sand Core" teams in the VGC 2020/2021 formats. Unlike standard Rock moves like *Stone Edge* or *Rock Slide*, Max Rockfall cannot miss, making it a reliable offensive tool. Its primary utility lies in its ability to grant Rock-type Pokémon a **50% Special Defense boost** mid-turn via the Sandstorm it creates, effectively increasing the user's bulk while attacking. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power scales with the base move; interacts with abilities like Sand Rush, Sand Force, and Sand Veil.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move is available to **any Pokémon** that knows a damaging Rock-type move while they are Dynamaxed. 
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Tyranitar**, **Gigalith**, and **Terrakion** to maximize their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage and self-set weather for defensive buffs.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on physical sweepers like **Excadrill** and **Landorus-Therian** (using *Rock Slide* or *Stone Edge* as a base) to trigger their own *Sand Rush* abilities or to chip away at Focus Sashes and Yache Berries.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible to any Pokémon capable of learning Rock-type moves via level-up, TM, or TR when the Dynamax mechanic is active.
