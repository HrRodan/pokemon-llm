* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively the signature move of **Reshiram**. It is also the primary Special Fire-type attack for **White Kyurem** when fused with Reshiram. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, it is a frequent target for **Smeargle** via Sketch in niche formats due to its high power-to-accuracy ratio.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it must be learned naturally by the legendary Pokémon of Truth.
