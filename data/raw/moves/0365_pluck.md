## Identity & Mechanics
**Pluck** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user attacks by pecking the target with a sharp beak or talons. This move is highly opportunistic; if the target is holding a Berry, the user snatches the item and consumes it immediately, gaining its benefits while depriving the opponent of their strategy. It is a contact-based move that rewards precision and timing.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is holding a Berry, the user steals the Berry and activates its effect instantly. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to consume the target's held Berry (if applicable). Note: Jaboca and Rowap Berries are removed but do not trigger their effects for the user.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility Tech / Reliability STAB.
* **Usage:** While its base power is modest, Pluck serves as a niche counter to Berry-reliant defensive cores (e.g., Pokémon using Sitrus, Lum, or pinch Berries like Salac). It is often compared to **Acrobatics**, which offers more power if the user lacks an item, or **Brave Bird**, which offers raw "Nuke" potential at the cost of recoil. In lower tiers or during a playthrough, it is a highly reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (85 learners), primarily among avian and winged Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Flying-types such as **Staraptor**, **Corviknight**, **Pidgeot**, and the Legendary **Ho-Oh** utilize this move naturally or via leveling. It is also found on the **Rowlet** and **Piplup** evolutionary lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Flying types for technical coverage or Berry disruption, such as **Malamar**, **Bibarel**, and **Veluza**. It is particularly effective on Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (like Scyther, though not on this specific list) as it boosts the base power to 90.
* **Acquisition:** Pluck was widely available as **TM88** in Generation IV and **TM46** in Generation V, making it a staple coverage move in those eras.
