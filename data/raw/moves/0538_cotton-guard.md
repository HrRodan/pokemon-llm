## Identity & Mechanics
**Cotton Guard** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user protects itself by rapidly producing and wrapping its body in a thick, dense layer of soft cotton, wool, or fleece. This insulating barrier acts as a physical cushion against incoming strikes, providing a massive boost to the user's survivability.
* **Effect:** Drastically raises the user’s Defense stat by **three stages** (+150%) in a single turn. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Physical Wall.
* **Usage:** Cotton Guard is the most efficient defensive setup move in the game, outpacing Iron Defense or Acid Armor by granting three stages instead of two. It is used to transform naturally bulky Pokémon into **impenetrable physical walls**, often forcing the opponent to switch to a Special Attacker or use *Haze* to reset stats. In modern generations, it has incredible synergy with the move **Body Press**, which calculates damage using the user's Defense stat rather than Attack. It does not deal damage, so it has no type-matchup advantages, but it is frequently blocked by **Taunt**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; blocked by *Crafty Shield*; susceptible to *Unaware* (which ignores the boosts) and *Critical Hits* (which bypass defensive stat stages).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (18 total learners), limited primarily to Pokémon with woolly or plant-based designs.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Whimsicott:** Its *Prankster* ability allows it to use Cotton Guard with increased priority, potentially boosting its Defense before an opponent can land a physical hit.
    * **Dubwool:** Frequently utilizes Cotton Guard in tandem with its *Fluffy* ability and *Body Press* for a devastating defensive-offensive combo.
    * **Mega Altaria:** Uses its natural bulk and Dragon/Fairy typing to set up and become nearly unkillable by physical Dragon or Fighting moves.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Grass types like **Ampharos** and **Furfrou** to compensate for their lack of reliable recovery by minimizing incoming physical damage.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is **not a TM or TR** in any generation and is almost exclusively learned via level-up or as an Egg Move.
