## Identity & Mechanics
**Slam** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user utilizes a long appendage—such as a tail, vine, or its own massive body—to strike the target with heavy, concussive force. This move represents a raw physical assault where the user swings its weight into the opponent to inflict blunt-force trauma.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 75%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Level-up Filler / High-Variance Physical Attack.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, **Slam** is almost never utilized due to its poor risk-to-reward ratio. Despite having a respectable 80 Base Power, its 75% accuracy makes it highly unreliable. It is strictly outclassed by **Body Slam** (85 Power, 100% Accuracy, 30% Paralysis chance) and **Strength** (80 Power, 100% Accuracy). 
* **Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most of the roster but provides **no Super Effective coverage**. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types and is completely ineffective against **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Slam has a wide distribution, particularly among Pokémon with elongated bodies or specialized appendages, appearing in the movepools of **109 species**.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently learned via level-up by iconic Pokémon such as **Dragonite**, **Serperior**, **Rillaboom**, and **Tinkaton**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon with diverse physical builds like **Steelix**, **Onix**, and **Sceptile**. It is typically used as a mid-game STAB or neutral-coverage option during the main story before being replaced by more accurate maneuvers.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through **Leveling Up**. Notably, it is not available as a TM or TR in modern generations, limiting its presence to those who learn it naturally or through breeding.
