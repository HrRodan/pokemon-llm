## Identity & Mechanics
**Gravity** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user exerts a powerful gravitational force that intensifies the weight of every Pokémon on the field for five turns. This crushing atmospheric pressure pulls airborne entities to the soil, prevents high-flying maneuvers, and makes all targets significantly easier to strike with physical or special attacks.
* **Effect:** For five turns, all Pokémon on the field have their **Evasion lowered by two stages** (effectively granting an accuracy multiplier of 1.67x to all moves). Crucially, it negates all immunities to Ground-type moves, grounding Pokémon that are Flying-type, possess the Levitate ability, or are under the effects of Magnet Rise or Air Balloon. 
* **Secondary Effect:** It immediately cancels and prevents the use of several moves: Fly, Bounce, Sky Drop, High Jump Kick, Jump Kick, and Splash. If a Pokémon is mid-air via Sky Drop when Gravity is used, a known mechanical quirk can cause the target to become stuck in the air.
* **Targeting:** Entire field (affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [---]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Field Control / Utility / Setup.
* **Usage:** Gravity is the cornerstone of "Gravity Offense" teams. It serves two primary functions: enabling **Ground-type nukes** (like Earthquake or Precipice Blades) to hit Flying-types and Levitate users for unresisted damage, and turning **low-accuracy moves** into reliable options. Under Gravity, moves like *Stone Edge*, *Hydro Pump*, and *Fire Blast* become nearly 100% accurate, while *Zap Cannon* and *Dynamic Punch* become viable threats. It is often compared to Trick Room as a field-warping setup move that requires specific team compositions to exploit.
* **Type Matchups:** By removing immunities, it allows Ground moves to deal **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types that would otherwise be protected by the Flying-type or Levitate.
* **Attributes:** Field Effect; Bypasses Accuracy checks to apply the condition; Not blocked by Protect (the field effect persists).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (155 learners), found predominantly among Psychic, Steel, and extraterrestrial-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Clefable**, **Bronzong**, and **Gigalith** to support teammates. **Metagross** and **Jirachi** can also utilize it to ensure their heavy-hitting moves never miss.
* **Coverage Utility:** High-tier threats like **Landorus (Incarnate/Therian)** and **Sandy Shocks** use Gravity to ensure their STAB Earth Power or Earthquake can bypass traditional checks like Corviknight or Rotom-Wash.
* **Acquisition:** It has historically been a Move Tutor staple and is currently available as a **TM** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
