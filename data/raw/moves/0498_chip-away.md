## Identity & Mechanics
**Chip-Away** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user patiently observes the target to identify a gap in their defenses before delivering a series of unrelenting, precise strikes. By focusing on the target's physical vulnerabilities rather than their current state, the user ensures the attack's power is not diminished by the opponent's defensive preparations or evasive maneuvers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. Damage calculation completely ignores the target’s positive or negative stat modifiers, specifically Defense and Evasion stages.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Anti-Setup Utility** / **Niche Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than standard Normal STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) options like *Return* or *Body Slam*, Chip-Away serves as a specialized tool to punish "Stat Ball" strategies. It is particularly effective against opponents relying on *Iron Defense*, *Acid Armor*, or *Double Team* to stall out matches. However, because it also ignores negative modifiers, it is counter-productive if the user has already lowered the opponent's Defense (e.g., via *Leer* or *Fire Lash*).
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is **Ineffective** against Rock and Steel, and has **No Effect** on Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rough Skin*, *Rocky Helmet*, or *Iron Barbs*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution, primarily found among physically imposing Pokémon (44 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Snorlax**, **Slaking**, and **Feraligatr**, who can leverage their high base Attack to brute-force through boosted defenses.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon like **Tyranitar** and **Nidoking** during the leveling process or in restricted formats to ensure they aren't walled by evasive or defensive boosters.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily limited to **Level Up** and **Egg Moves**. It is notably absent from the TM/TR lists in most generations, making it a "natural" move for specific evolutionary lines.
