## Identity & Mechanics
**Soft-Boiled** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user produces a nutritious egg and consumes it to restore its own vitality. This move is synonymous with high-HP defensive walls and is a cornerstone of "stall" and "fat" team archetypes, providing immediate sustainability during a match.
* **Effect:** Heals the user for 50% of its maximum HP. Outside of battle (in older generations), it can also be used to transfer 20% of the user's max HP to another party member.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Instant Recovery / Defensive Utility.
* **Usage:** Soft-Boiled is the premier recovery tool for the "Pink Blobs" (Chansey and Blissey). It is functionally identical to moves like *Recover*, *Slack Off*, and *Milk Drink*. Its primary purpose is to allow a Pokémon to "wall" opponents indefinitely by healing off damage taken while switching in or while whittling down the opponent with status or seismic toss. In Generation 9, its PP was significantly nerfed from 10 to 5, making it a precious resource that must be managed carefully against pressure-heavy teams.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Does not check for accuracy. It is blocked by *Taunt* and its healing can be prevented by *Heal Block*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (9 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon associated with eggs or fairy-like physiology.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Chansey** and **Blissey**, who utilize their massive HP pools to become nearly unkillable special walls. **Clefable** (via Transfer/Old Gens) also uses it to supplement its *Magic Guard* ability for incredible longevity.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mew**, providing the Mythical Pokémon with a reliable way to stay healthy while acting as a versatile support lead or setup sweeper.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely rare. It was available as **TM41** in Generation I and as a Move Tutor in Generation III (FireRed/LeafGreen/Emerald). In modern generations, it is almost exclusively a natural level-up move for the Chansey line.
