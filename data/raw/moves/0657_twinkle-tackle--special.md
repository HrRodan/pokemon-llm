## Identity & Mechanics
**Twinkle Tackle (Special)** is a Special Fairy-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** This move represents the ultimate expression of Fairy-type energy. The user channels the power of the Z-Crystal, Fairium Z, to create a whimsical and dazzling environment filled with sparkling light and stardust, before unleashing a concentrated burst of magical energy upon the target.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used once per battle. It transforms a base Special Fairy-type move into a high-powered attack. Its base power scales based on the power of the original move (e.g., a base *Moonblast* yields a 175-power Twinkle Tackle).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, like most Z-Moves, it bypasses accuracy checks and ignores effects like *Protect* (dealing 25% of the damage through the shield).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–195], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** One-Time Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats to secure a crucial OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) on a defensive threat that might otherwise survive a standard STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) move. It is the premier tool for Fairy-types to bypass their usual checks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power is dependent on the base move; requires the user to hold a **Fairium Z** crystal.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Availability is tied to the **Fairium Z** crystal rather than a level-up or TM pool; any Pokémon with a Special Fairy-type move can utilize it.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Tapu Lele** and **Magearna** to break through specially defensive walls. **Primarina** often uses it to leverage its high Special Attack stat for a devastating mid-game strike.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Clefable** or **Sylveon** to provide a high-momentum play against Dragon-type switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** In Generation VII, the player obtains the Fairium Z from Mina during the island challenge, making it a key mechanic in the Alola region's gameplay. Note: Z-Moves were removed in subsequent generations (Gen VIII onwards).
