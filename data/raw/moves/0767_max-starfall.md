## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Starfall** is a Physical (or Special) Fairy-type move introduced in **Generation VIII**.
* **Description:** A powerful Max Move where the user channels celestial energy to rain down shimmering, star-like projectiles upon the target. This cosmic bombardment saturates the battlefield with pink mist, transforming the environment into **Misty Terrain** for five turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the power of the user's base move and automatically sets Misty Terrain. While Misty Terrain is active, grounded Pokémon cannot be afflicted with non-volatile status conditions (Burn, Paralyze, Sleep, Poison, Freeze) and the power of Dragon-type moves used against grounded targets is halved.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to set **Misty Terrain**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales 90–150], Accuracy [∞]%, PP [10].
* **Role:** Field Manipulator / Anti-Status Nuke.
* **Usage:** In the Generation VIII competitive meta (VGC and Singles), Max Starfall served as a vital defensive tool for offensive threats. By setting Misty Terrain, a Dynamaxed Pokémon could protect itself from crippling status moves like *Will-O-Wisp* or *Thunder Wave*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (cannot miss except against semi-invulnerable targets); power scales based on the base Fairy-type move used to trigger it.

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Max Move, it has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that know at least one Fairy-type attacking move while Dynamaxed. 
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Togekiss**, **Mimikyu**, and **Primarina**, who benefit from the status immunity to maintain their sweeps. **Zacian** (in casual or specific formats allowing Dynamax) and **Gardevoir** also utilize it for heavy STAB damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Fairy Pokémon like **Dragapult** (via Dazzling Gleam) or **Mew** to provide a surprise Fairy-type nuke and clear existing Terrains (like Psychic or Electric Terrain).
* **Acquisition:** Available to any Pokémon equipped with a Fairy-type damage move (TMs like *Play Rough* or *Dazzling Gleam*) while the Dynamax mechanic is active.
