## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Dance** is a Status Dragon-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user performs a vigorous, mystical rhythmic dance that channels draconic energy to heighten its combat instincts. This surge of power bolsters the user's physical muscles and reflexes, providing a significant boost to both offensive pressure and mobility. It is a cornerstone setup move for physical sweepers looking to outpace and overwhelm the opposition.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Attack and Speed stats by one stage (+1) each.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Setup Sweeper / Win Condition.
* **Usage:** Widely considered one of the best setup moves in competitive Pokémon history. While **Swords Dance** provides a larger Attack boost (+2), Dragon Dance is often superior as the Speed increase allows the user to outspeed naturally faster threats or Choice Scarf users, preventing them from being revenge killed. It is the primary tool for turning "Bulky Offense" Pokémon into late-game cleaners.
* **Attributes:** Not affected by Protect (as it targets the user), bypasses accuracy/evasion checks, and is not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among draconic and reptilian Pokémon (84 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Dragonite**, **Salamence**, and **Gyarados**, who utilize their natural bulk or abilities like Multiscale and Intimidate to find safe opportunities to "DDance." **Roaring Moon** and **Baxcalibur** are premier modern users of the move in high-tier play.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Dragon types such as **Tyranitar**, **Feraligatr**, and **Crawdaunt** to rectify their middling Speed tiers and become terrifying physical wallbreakers.
* **Acquisition:** Historically a high-value Egg Move or move-pool staple for Dragons; it has become significantly more accessible in recent generations via **TR13** (Sword/Shield) and **TM100** (Scarlet/Violet).
