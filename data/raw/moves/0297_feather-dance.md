## Identity & Mechanics
**Feather Dance** is a Status Flying-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user shakes its plumage or flutters its wings, releasing a cloud of soft, downy feathers that envelop the target. This distracting and obstructive flurry of down makes it difficult for the opponent to move with precision or power, effectively neutralizing their physical offensive pressure.
* **Effect:** Sharply lowers the target's Attack stat (by two stages).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% execution on hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Non-adjacent in Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Physical Neutralizer / Defensive Utility.
* **Usage:** Feather Dance serves as a powerful **Physical Check** used to cripple "Physical Sweepers" and "Wallbreakers." Because it drops Attack by two stages (-2), it effectively negates a *Swords Dance* boost in a single turn. It is often compared to *Will-O-Wisp*; while it lacks the chip damage of a Burn, it has a perfect 100% accuracy and is not resisted by Fire-type Pokémon. It is particularly effective at forcing switches, as a -2 Attack drop usually renders a physical attacker useless until they rotate out.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Dance-based move**, meaning it can be copied by Pokémon with the *Dancer* Ability (like Oricorio). It is blocked by *Substitute*, the *Clear Body* / *White Smoke* / *Full Metal Body* abilities, and the item *Clear Amulet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (72 learners), almost exclusively limited to avian or feathered Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Pidgeot (and Mega Pidgeot)**, **Staraptor**, **Altaria**, and **Talonflame**.
* **Coverage & Niche Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Flying type bird-like Pokémon such as **Blaziken** and **Quaquaval** to help them survive physical hits while they set up their own boosts. It is also a key utility move for the Psychic-type **Espathra**, allowing it to survive physical priority moves while its *Speed Boost* ability triggers.
* **Acquisition:** While historically learned via level-up or Breeding, it has become more accessible as a **TM** in recent titles like *Scarlet & Violet*.
