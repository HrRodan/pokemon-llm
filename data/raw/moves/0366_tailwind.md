## Identity & Mechanics
**Tailwind** is a status Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user whips up a turbulent, supportive whirlwind that flows from behind the party, drastically reducing air resistance and increasing momentum. This gust of wind lingers on the user's side of the battlefield, ensuring that all allied Pokémon can move with heightened agility and reaction speed.
* **Effect:** For the next four turns (including the turn of use), the Speed stat of all Pokémon on the user’s side of the field is doubled. This effect persists even if the original user switches out or faints.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User's Side (Affects all allies in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Elite Speed Control / Momentum Generator.
* **Usage:** Tailwind is a cornerstone of the VGC (Doubles) format. It is the primary method for offensive teams to outpace "Hyper Offense" or "Mid-Speed" threats. It serves as a direct proactive counter to **Trick Room** (by stalling turns or outspeeding outside of it) and is often compared to **Icy Wind** or **String Shot**; however, while those moves lower opponent speed, Tailwind’s self-buff is more reliable as it cannot be blocked by "Clear Body" or "Mirror Armor."
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; blocked by the move *Taunt*.

    * **Zapdos & Suicune:** Iconic bulky setters that can survive hits to established speed control for their teammates.
    * **Pelipper:** Often sets Tailwind to support its "Rain Dish" or "Swift Swim" teammates, further compounding speed tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on offensive powerhouses like **Roaring Moon**, **Hydreigon**, and **Salamence** to allow them to function as self-sufficient sweepers or late-game cleaners.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in recent generations, including Scarlet & Violet.
