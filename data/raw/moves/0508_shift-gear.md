## Identity & Mechanics
**Shift Gear** is a **Status Steel-type** move introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** The user rotates its internal gears and mechanical components at high speeds, synchronizing its systems for peak performance. This mechanical recalibration generates immense momentum and torque, drastically increasing the user's agility while heightening their physical striking power.
* **Effect:** Raises the user's **Attack stat by one stage** (+1) and its **Speed stat by two stages** (+2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Self-buff).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Elite Setup / Sweeper Enabler.**
* **Usage:** Shift Gear is widely considered one of the most powerful setup moves in the Pokémon franchise. It is a strictly superior version of *Dragon Dance*, offering the same Attack boost but doubling the Speed investment. A single use allows a Pokémon to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame, including most Choice Scarf users. It is primarily used on late-game cleaners to facilitate a "sweep." As a Steel-type move, it is flavor-themed around mechanical or metallic Pokémon.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; not affected by Protect (targets self); not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (8 total learners), making it a rare and highly coveted asset.
* **Prominent Users:** Originally the signature move of the **Klinklang** line. It is most infamously utilized by the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna**, which uses the Speed boost to become an unstoppable "ShiftGear-Stored Power" sweeper. **Revavroom** also utilizes it to leverage its high Attack and unique Poison/Steel typing.
* **Coverage Utility:** **Toxtricity (Amped Form)** is a notable non-Steel type that gains access to this move, allowing it to function as a dangerous mixed sweeper. **Cyclizar** can use Shift Gear to boost its stats before passing them to a teammate via *Shed Tail*. 
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it has historically **never been a TM or TR**, restricted entirely to natural level-up or specific move pools for mechanical/engine-themed Pokémon.
