## Identity & Mechanics
**Scald** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user blasts the target with a high-pressure stream of boiling-hot water. This move is unique among Water-type attacks for its ability to inflict thermal burns, making it a "heat-based" Water move. In addition to its offensive properties, Scald has the hidden utility of thawing the user out instantly if they are frozen when they attempt to use the move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a high probability of burning the opponent.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility STAB / Defensive Wallbreaking.
* **Usage:** Scald is arguably the most influential Water-type move in competitive history. While **Surf** offers slightly more power (90) and **Hydro Pump** offers raw damage (110), Scald is often preferred on defensive and utility sets. The 30% burn chance provides a massive deterrent for physical attackers (like Garchomp or Great Tusk) to switch in, as a burn effectively halves their Attack stat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is considered a Water-based projectile but does not have "pulse" or "ball" modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very wide** distribution (171 learners), making it a staple of almost every Water-type's movepool.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on defensive pivots and walls such as **Toxapex**, **Suicune**, **Slowbro**, and **Gastrodon**. It is the signature-style move for the Mythical Pokémon **Volcanion**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by non-Water types like **Emboar** (as a Fire-type using "boiling" water) and **Dragapult** (in specific generations) to punish physical switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM55** (Gen 5-7) or **TR84** (Gen 8). In Generation 9, its distribution was significantly curtailed to limit its oppressive defensive presence, though it remains available to specific thematic users like **Sinistcha** and **Walking Wake**.
