## Identity & Mechanics
**Noble Roar** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user lets out a majestic and intimidating cry that shakes the fighting spirit of the opponent. This sound-based technique radiates an aura of authority, effectively demoralizing the target and stifling their offensive momentum.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack and Special Attack stats by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply stat reductions upon successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon. As a **Sound-based move**, it bypasses *Substitute* but is completely nullified by the ability *Soundproof*.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Utility Debuffer / Support.
* **Usage:** Noble Roar is primarily used to cripple "Mixed Attackers" or to force a switch by neutralizing an opponent's offensive presence. While often overshadowed by *Parting Shot* (which provides a pivot), Noble Roar is valuable for defensive walls that intend to stay on the field. It is particularly effective in doubles formats to soften Blows from high-threat strikers. It deals neutral "type" interaction as a status move, meaning it can affect **Ghost** types despite being Normal-type.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (interacts with *Liquid Voice*, *Punk Rock*, and *Soundproof*). Does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 total learners), primarily reserved for Pokémon with a "regal" or "draconic" theme.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Pyroar** line (its signature thematic move), and utilized by legendary powerhouses like **Solgaleo**, **Zacian**, and **Zekrom**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on bulky support variants of **Scream Tail** and **Dondozo** to minimize incoming damage while setting up hazards or stalling. It is also found on **Kommo-o**, helping it survive hits while preparing for a sweep.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up; it is not currently available as a universal TM/TR, making its distribution exclusive to its natural learners.
