## Identity & Mechanics
**Beak Blast** is a physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user focuses its energy to heat its beak to incredible, glowing temperatures before launching a devastating strike. This process involves a charging phase at the start of the turn, during which the beak becomes so hot that any physical contact results in immediate, searing burns to the attacker.
* **Effect:** This is a negative priority move (-3). At the beginning of the turn, the user starts heating its beak. If an opponent hits the user with a contact-making move during this charging phase, that opponent is automatically **Burned**. The user then attacks at the end of the turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **Burn** any Pokémon that makes contact during the charging phase.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** High-Utility Physical Nuke / Defensive Pivot.
* **Usage:** Beak Blast is a unique alternative to Brave Bird. While it has lower priority, it lacks recoil damage and provides massive utility by punishing physical attackers with a permanent Burn status, effectively halving their Attack stat. It is particularly effective against "Contact" moves like Fake Out, U-turn, or Close Combat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **non-contact** move despite its name, meaning the user does not trigger the opponent's Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin. It is a **bullet/ballistics** move in terms of flavor, though not explicitly blocked by Bulletproof in most generations.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Toucannon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is limited to the Toucannon evolutionary line, it is never seen as a coverage option on other Flying-types. In the competitive "Smogon" formats or VGC, Toucannon relies on this move to threaten physical sweepers who would otherwise attempt to KO it with contact moves.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally by Toucannon upon evolution or via Move Reminder.
