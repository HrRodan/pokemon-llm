## Identity & Mechanics
**Baddy Bad** is a Special Dark-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*.
* **Description:** The user adopts a mischievous persona to strike the foe with dark energy, simultaneously manifesting a protective, shimmering barrier of purple light. This move combines offensive pressure with defensive utility, effectively weaving the effects of the move **Reflect** into a damaging attack.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and automatically sets up **Reflect** on the user’s side of the field for five turns.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to set the **Reflect** status (halving physical damage taken by the user's team).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility Damage / Screen Setter (Role Compression).
* **Usage:** Baddy Bad is a premier example of "Role Compression." It allows the user to maintain offensive momentum while providing team-wide physical mitigation. Compared to its nearest rival, **Dark Pulse**, it has slightly lower accuracy and no flinch chance, but the guaranteed Reflect effect makes it far superior for survivability. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is unaffected by abilities like Iron Fist or Tough Claws.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by the **Partner Eevee** (Eevee-starter) in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!* via the Move Tutor in Celadon City.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the Partner Eevee is a Normal-type, Baddy Bad is essential for providing Eevee with Special Dark-type coverage to counter Ghost-type threats that are otherwise immune to its STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR or breeding; it can only be taught by a specialized tutor. In the context of the *Let's Go* series, it is considered one of the "Partner Powers" that makes Eevee competitively viable against fully evolved Pokémon.
