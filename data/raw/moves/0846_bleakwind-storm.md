## Identity & Mechanics
**Bleakwind Storm** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user summons a localized vortex of savagely cold, biting winds to lash out at the opposition, chilling both the body and spirit of those caught in the gale. This aerial assault represents the raw power of the storm, functioning as a high-intensity wind-based attack.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to the target. In the main series (Generation IX), it has a 30% chance to lower the target's Speed by one stage. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it carries a chance to inflict the Frostbite status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to lower **Speed** (Main Series) or inflict **Frostbite** (PLA).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread damage in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 80%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Spread Nuke / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in **Rain-based teams** and VGC (Doubles) formats. Similar to *Hurricane* and *Thunder*, Bleakwind Storm bypasses accuracy checks and becomes **100% accurate during Rain**. It serves as a more powerful, albeit less accurate, alternative to Air Slash, and a more reliable spread option than Hurricane for hitting multiple targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Wind-based move**, meaning it interacts with the *Wind Power* and *Wind Rider* abilities. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the signature move of the Tornadus line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Tornadus (Incarnate Forme)** and **Tornadus (Therian Forme)**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to Tornadus, it is rarely seen as "coverage" on other types, but it defines Tornadus's offensive presence. In VGC, Tornadus-Incarnate often pairs this move with **Tailwind** and **Rain Dance/Prankster** to ensure maximum accuracy and field control.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned naturally by leveling up or through Move Tutors specifically for the Forces of Nature.
