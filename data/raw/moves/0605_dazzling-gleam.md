## Identity & Mechanics
**Dazzling Gleam** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user releases a blinding, radiant burst of light from its body, damaging all nearby foes. This light-based attack is fueled by mystical energy, making it a staple for Pokémon that channel lunar or ethereal power. Its ability to strike multiple targets makes it a visual and tactical spectacle in group battles.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage to the target(s).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance of additional effects). 
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move). In Double Battles, its damage is reduced to 75% when hitting multiple targets.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Spread Coverage.
* **Usage:** While often overshadowed by **Moonblast** (95 Power) in Single Battles due to lower base power and lack of secondary effects, Dazzling Gleam is the premier Fairy-type STAB move in **VGC and Doubles** formats because it hits both opponents simultaneously. It serves as a consistent way to bypass *Follow Me* redirection by hitting the entire field. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is not blocked by *Bulletproof* or *Soundproof*, but it is a light-based move that interacts with specific niche abilities (though rarely relevant in standard play).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (207 learners), making it one of the most accessible Fairy-type moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Clefable**, **Sylveon**, **Gardevoir**, and the Paradox Pokémon **Flutter Mane**. It is a signature spread option for the **Tapu** guardians (Koko, Lele, Fini, Bulu).
* **Coverage Utility:** Highly valued as a coverage option for Special Attackers that struggle with Dark or Dragon types. It is frequently seen on **Gengar**, **Alakazam**, and **Gholdengo** to provide a "Dragon-slaying" tool.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) across all regions since its debut, ensuring most Special-leaning Pokémon have access to it.
