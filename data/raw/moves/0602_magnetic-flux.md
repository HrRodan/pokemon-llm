## Identity & Mechanics
**Magnetic Flux** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user exerts control over local electromagnetic fields, generating a polarizing wave of energy that resonates with specific biological or mechanical polarities. This flux envelops the user and its teammates, reinforcing their physical and energetic durability. Because it relies on magnetic synchronization, it only affects Pokémon whose internal power is governed by the Plus or Minus Abilities.
* **Effect:** Raises the **Defense** and **Special Defense** of the user and all friendly Pokémon on the field by one stage each, provided they have the **Plus** or **Minus** Ability.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User and Allies (optimized for Doubles and Battle Royals).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Niche Utility / Defensive Setup.
* **Usage:** Magnetic Flux is a highly specialized support move almost exclusively seen in Doubles formats. It functions similarly to moves like *Gear Up*, requiring specific Ability synergy to be functional. While providing a dual-defensive boost is theoretically strong for creating "bulky" win conditions, the requirement of having Plus or Minus significantly limits its viability, as those abilities are often outclassed by more versatile traits like *Levitate* or *Magnet Pull*.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move targeting allies, it does not deal damage. However, being an Electric-type move, it can be redirected or nullified by *Lightning Rod* if used by an opponent in specific niche scenarios, though it primarily targets the user's side of the field.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; bypasses accuracy checks (cannot miss).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (11 total learners), primarily limited to mechanical or electromagnetic-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most naturally utilized by **Magnezone**, **Klinklang**, and the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna**. **Toxtricity (Low Key Form)** also has access to it.
* **Coverage Utility:** While primarily found on Electric and Steel types, **Zapdos** and **Ampharos** (including Mega Ampharos) can learn it, though they rarely run it due to the strict Ability requirements for the move to successfully trigger. 
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is not available as a TM or TR in most generations, usually requiring leveling up or specific Move Tutor access in older titles. It is notably absent from the move pools of many Pokémon in the most recent generations (Gen IX).
