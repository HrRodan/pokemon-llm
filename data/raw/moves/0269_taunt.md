## Identity & Mechanics
**Taunt** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user provokes the target into a rage, mocking their tactical approach and forcing them to abandon non-combative maneuvers. By inciting this aggression, the user ensures the opponent can only focus on direct offensive strikes, effectively silencing defensive or strategic plays.
* **Effect:** For the next 3 to 5 turns, the target is prevented from using any Status-class moves. If the target attempts to use a Status move, the move will fail. This includes recovery moves, entry hazards (like Stealth Rock), stat-boosting moves (like Swords Dance), and status-inflicting moves (like Will-O-Wisp). Moves that call other moves (Metronome, Sleep Talk) are also disabled, though retaliatory moves like Counter and Mirror Coat remain usable.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Premier **Stallbreaker** and **Disruption Utility**.
* **Usage:** Taunt is a cornerstone of competitive play, used to shut down defensive walls, prevent the setup of entry hazards, and stop "Setup Sweepers" from boosting their stats. It is the primary counter to "Passive" Pokémon like Blissey or Toxapex. While it has no direct rival, it is often weighed against **Encore**, which locks a foe into their last move rather than just prohibiting status moves.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage, but as a Dark-type move, it is ineffective against Pokémon with the **Magic Bounce** Ability or those behind a **Substitute** (in earlier generations).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks (100% hit rate). It is particularly potent when used by Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability, granting the move +1 Priority.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (448 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Incineroar**, **Grimmsnarl** (due to Prankster), **Corviknight**, and **Gyarados**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on fast offensive threats like **Gengar**, **Weavile**, and **Tornadus-Therian** to prevent opponents from recovering health or using Protect. It is also a staple on Lead Pokémon like **Aerodactyl** or **Azelf** to ensure they win the "Hazard War."
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** or **TR** in every generation since its debut, ensuring almost any Pokémon with a mean-spirited or aggressive thematic design can learn it.
