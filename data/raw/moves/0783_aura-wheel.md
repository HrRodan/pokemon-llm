## Identity & Mechanics
**Aura Wheel** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user generates a high-speed wheel of elemental energy from its cheeks and charges the opponent. As a signature move tied to the **Hunger Switch** Ability, the move’s visual and elemental properties shift dynamically: it radiates yellow electricity in Full Belly Mode and dark, purple malice in Hangry Mode. This duality makes it a versatile tool for cycling through offensive pressures.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the user’s Speed stat by one stage (100% activation). The move's type is **Electric** when the user is in Full Belly Mode and **Dark** when the user is in Hangry Mode.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise **Speed** by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Self-Buffing Nuke** / **Signature Sweep Enabler**.
* **Usage:** Aura Wheel is one of the most mathematically efficient moves in the game, offering high base power with no accuracy drawbacks or recoil. It acts as both a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and a setup tool, allowing the user to outpace the entire unboosted metagame after a single use. In its **Electric** state, it punishes Water and Flying types; in its **Dark** state, it deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, physical move that bypasses many common contact-based punishments like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, functioning exclusively as a signature move (2 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized uniquely by **Morpeko (Full Belly)** and **Morpeko (Hangry)**. Its usage is entirely dependent on Morpeko's survival and the timing of its "Hunger Switch" ability to hit specific targets with the appropriate type.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move changes type every turn, it provides inherent "built-in" coverage. A Morpeko user can timing-out attacks to hit a Corviknight with an Electric-type Aura Wheel, then hit a Dragapult with a Dark-type Aura Wheel on the following turn.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via level-up for the Morpeko line; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other species.
