## Identity & Mechanics
**Collision Course** is a Physical Fighting-type signature move introduced in Generation IX.
* **Description:** The user taps into primal, ancient energy to undergo a momentary transformation before crashing into the target with the force of a prehistoric explosion. This high-impact maneuver generates a massive seismic shockwave that specifically punishes targets with elemental vulnerabilities, making it a "super-effective specialist" nuke.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to a single target. If this move deals Super Effective damage, its power is multiplied by an additional 1.33x. When combined with the standard Super Effective multiplier, the total damage multiplier becomes approximately **2.66x**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Efficiency Wallbreaker / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** Collision Course is the premier Fighting-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for its users. Unlike *Close Combat*, which has the drawback of lowering the user's Defense and Special Defense, Collision Course has no negative stat drops and rewards the player for hitting weaknesses. It is particularly devastating against defensive Steel or Dark types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (5 forms of the same Pokémon).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Koraidon**. While the data lists various builds (Sprinting, Swimming, Gliding, and Limited), these represent the Paldean Box Legendary's traversal forms, while the **Apex Build** uses it to dominate the Uber tier.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not found on non-Fighting Pokémon for coverage. However, when used by Koraidon, it synergizes with its **Orichalcum Pulse** ability; the sun-boosted Attack stat combined with the 1.33x Super Effective multiplier allows it to OHKO even neutral targets after minimal chip damage.
* **Acquisition:** Unique to Koraidon; it cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to any other species.
