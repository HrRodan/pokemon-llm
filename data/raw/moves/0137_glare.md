## Identity & Mechanics
**Glare** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user intimidates the target with a terrifying, predatory gaze. This soul-piercing stare transfixes the opponent, causing their muscles to seize up in fear. As a Normal-type status move, it carries the unique tactical advantage of bypassing the traditional immunities associated with Electric-type paralyzing moves.
* **Effect:** Paralyzes the target, reducing their Speed by 50% and granting a 25% chance for the target to be "fully paralyzed" (unable to move) each turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Direct status application).
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Premier Speed Control / Utility.
* **Usage:** Glare is widely considered one of the best status moves in the game. Unlike its rival, *Thunder Wave*, Glare is a Normal-type move, meaning it can successfully paralyze **Ground-type** Pokémon that are otherwise immune to Electric-based paralysis. This makes it an incredibly safe "click" for defensive pivots. While it does not deal damage, its ability to cripple fast sweepers and provide team-wide speed control is invaluable.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses accuracy checks in certain niche historical contexts, but currently functions as a standard 100% accuracy status move. It does not hit Ghost-types in Generations 1-3, but since Generation 4, it affects all types (except Electric-types, who gained a blanket immunity to paralysis in Gen 6).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (19 total learners), primarily restricted to serpentine, reptilian, or intimidating Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Zygarde:** Frequently uses Glare on defensive "Coil" or "Thousand Arrows" sets to cripple faster threats like Weavile or Dragapult.
    * **Serperior:** Often runs Glare alongside *Leaf Storm* to provide utility, allowing it to outspeed the entire unboosted metagame after one paralysis.
    * **Dudunsparce:** Utilizes Glare in conjunction with the *Serene Grace* ability to create "Para-Flinch" loops with moves like *Rock Slide*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Heliolisk** or **Druddigon** as a surprise utility option to punish switch-ins from Ground-type counters like Great Tusk or Landorus-T.
* **Acquisition:** Very rare; Glare is almost never a TM or TR, usually requiring Level Up or specific Egg Move breeding paths, making its presence on a team highly predictable but still difficult to switch into.
