## Identity & Mechanics
**Autotomize** is a Status Steel-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user sheds or ejects outer metallic layers or extraneous body parts to streamline its frame. By reducing physical mass and air resistance, the Pokémon achieves a state of extreme agility, significantly boosting its kinetic potential and movement velocity.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user’s Speed stat by two stages (+200%). Additionally, it halves the user’s body weight; this weight reduction is permanent while the Pokémon is active and does not stack with multiple uses.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 15.
* **Role:** Setup / Speed Fixing.
* **Usage:** Autotomize is a specialized setup move used by bulky, naturally slow Pokémon to transform into "Late-Game Sweepers." While it is mechanically similar to *Agility* or *Rock Polish*, the weight reduction creates a unique trade-off. It reduces damage taken from weight-based moves like **Low Kick** and **Grass Knot**, but it simultaneously weakens the power of the user's own weight-based attacks, such as **Heavy Slam** or **Heat Crash**. It is most effective on Pokémon that have high natural defenses but lack the speed to prevent being revenge-killed.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; categorized as a Status move (vulnerable to *Taunt*).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (44 learners), restricted almost exclusively to Steel-types, Rock-types, and certain crystalline or mechanical lifeforms.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Aegislash** (to outspeed and KO threats before they can hit its vulnerable Blade Forme), **Celesteela** (to facilitate Beast Boost sweeps), and **Klinklang** (as its primary method of speed control).
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Necrozma (Dusk Mane)** and **Ultra Necrozma** in Uber tiers to turn the heavy legendary into a lethal, outspeeding win-condition. **Aggron** and **Steelix** also utilize it in lower tiers to mitigate their crippling Speed stats.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via level-up by inorganic Pokémon; it has occasionally been available as a **TM/TR** in specific regional formats, though its distribution remains more exclusive than *Rock Polish*.
