## Identity & Mechanics
**Mind-Blown** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon / Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** The user, specifically the Ultra Beast Blacephalon, detaches its own volatile, firecracker-like head and triggers a massive explosion that engulfs the entire battlefield. This catastrophic detonation emits blinding light and intense heat, dealing massive damage to all nearby targets while severely wounding the user in the process.
* **Effect:** Inflicts heavy damage on all other Pokémon on the field. The user simultaneously takes recoil damage equal to exactly 50% of its maximum HP (rounded up). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary "effect" is the fixed recoil cost). Crucially, the user takes recoil damage even if the move misses, is blocked by **Protect**, hits a **Substitute**, or is nullified by abilities like **Flash Fire**.
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Mind-Blown is one of the most powerful Fire-type moves in the game, outclassing **Fire Blast** (110 BP) and **Overheat** (130 BP) in raw power without the drawback of lowering Special Attack. However, the 50% HP cost is a massive trade-off, usually limiting the user to two uses at most. It is primarily used to secure a OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) to trigger the **Beast Boost** ability or to deal massive spread damage in VGC/Doubles formats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Spread Move**, meaning its power is reduced by 25% in double battles if it hits multiple targets.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (Only 1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the **Signature Move** of **Blacephalon**. It is currently the only Pokémon capable of learning this move naturally.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Blacephalon, it is always used as a high-octane **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) option rather than a coverage move. Blacephalon's high Special Attack stat makes this move one of the most feared special nukes in the competitive circuit.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it must be learned by Blacephalon upon leveling up or via the Move Reminder.
