## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Slide** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user summons a localized avalanche or hurls massive, jagged boulders at the opposition to inflict heavy damage. The weight and suddenness of the tumbling rocks can disorient the target, potentially causing them to lose their turn. In double battles, this move strikes all adjacent opponents, making it a premier choice for multi-target pressure.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent opponents. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**. This effect is particularly potent when used by high-speed Pokémon, as it can effectively "skip" the opponent's turn.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Disruption Tool.
* **Usage:** Rock Slide is the gold standard for Rock-type coverage in the VGC (Doubles) format due to its ability to hit both opponents and its high flinch probability. While it has lower raw power than *Stone Edge*, its superior accuracy (90% vs 80%) makes it the preferred **Consistency Option**. It is often paired with a Choice Scarf to maximize the flinch-hax potential by outspeeding the field. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; affected by Wide Guard (damage is reduced in spread scenarios).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (475 total learners), making it one of the most accessible coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Tyranitar**, **Garchomp**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Lycanroc**. These Pokémon leverage their high Attack stats and (in the case of Landorus or Lycanroc) high Speed to fish for flinches.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon like **Machamp**, **Excadrill**, and **Salamence** to provide vital coverage against Flying-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** or **TR** in almost every generation, including the original Kanto games, Sword & Shield, and Scarlet & Violet.
