## Identity & Mechanics
**Metal Claw** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user rakes the target with hard, sharpened claws of steel or metallic-infused appendages. The strike often emits a cold, metallic glint as the user slashes with high-speed friction. This aggressive maneuver has a small chance of heightening the user's offensive momentum, effectively hardening their resolve and physical power.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to raise the user’s **Attack** stat by one stage (+1).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 95%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Transitionary Physical Move.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Metal Claw is largely outclassed by **Iron Head** (for its higher flinch chance and power) or **Meteor Mash** (for its higher power and better Attack-boost probability). It is primarily used during the "in-game" leveling process or in lower-tier formats where a Pokémon lacks access to stronger Steel-type coverage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or Iron Barbs and is boosted by the **Tough Claws** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (118 learners), appearing frequently on Pokémon with avian talons, reptilian claws, or metallic bodies.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Metagross**, **Lucario**, **Aggron**, and **Excadrill** as a natural level-up move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Steel Pokémon like **Charizard**, **Garchomp**, and **Kingler** to provide early-game answers to Rock-type or Fairy-type threats. 
* **Legendary Presence:** Several high-tier Legendaries and Paradox Pokémon, including **Zacian**, **Dialga**, and **Iron Crown**, include this in their move pools.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a level-up move, it has become more accessible as a **TM** in recent generations, including Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
