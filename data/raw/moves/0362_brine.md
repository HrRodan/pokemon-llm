## Identity & Mechanics
**Brine** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user releases a blast of highly concentrated salt water at the target. This caustic solution is designed to "rub salt in the wound," reacting violently with injured foes to deal massive damage. Visually, it often appears as a pressurized spray of seawater that becomes more volatile as the target's health wanes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target's current HP is less than or equal to 50% of its maximum HP, the base power of this move doubles from 65 to **130**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65 (130 when triggered), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Finisher.
* **Usage:** Brine is often compared to **Surf** (90 BP) and **Hydro Pump** (110 BP). While its base damage is lower than standard STAB options, its boosted power (130) surpasses even Hydro Pump without the accuracy risk. It is most effective on bulky, defensive Pokémon that slowly chip away at opponents until they reach the 50% threshold, at which point Brine becomes a powerful execution tool. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a projectile-based special attack; it does not make contact and is not affected by Iron Fist or similar physical modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (114 learners), primarily concentrated among Water-type Pokémon and those found in coastal environments.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Empoleon**, **Blastoise**, and **Kyogre** as a flavorful alternative to more common Water moves. It is also a staple for **Toxapex**, which uses its defensive profile to whittle targets down into Brine’s "kill range."
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Dragapult** or **Hariyama** (though the latter is physical-oriented) to provide niche Special coverage against Rock or Fire types. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM55** in Generation IV and **TR45** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), making it easily accessible for competitive team building.
