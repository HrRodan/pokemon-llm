## Identity & Mechanics
**Milk Drink** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user consumes highly nutritious milk to instantly revitalize its body and replenish stamina. This restorative action allows the Pokémon to maintain its presence on the field by recovering from significant exhaustion and damage.
* **Effect:** Restores the user's HP by 50% of its maximum HP. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable Recovery / Sustainability.
* **Usage:** Milk Drink is a cornerstone move for defensive archetypes, functioning identically to **Recover**, **Soft-Boiled**, and **Slack Off**. It provides the user with the longevity required to "stall" out opponents, scout for moves, or mitigate damage taken while setting up hazards or status conditions. In Generation 9, its PP was significantly nerfed (matching other recovery moves), making it a more precious resource in long-drawn-out matches.
* **Attributes:** This move is not affected by Protect but is hindered by **Heal Block**. In earlier generations (Gen 2-6), it possessed a unique out-of-battle mechanic where the user could give 20% of its max HP to heal another Pokémon in the party.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (3 total learners), making it one of the rarest recovery moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Miltank**, where it synergizes with the *Thick Fat* ability to create a formidable physical wall. It is also utilized by **Gogoat** and its pre-evolution **Skiddo**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen outside of these specific evolutionary lines. It is not available via TM or TR, cementing it as a "signature-style" move for bovine-themed Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** Exclusively learned through leveling up by its natural users; it has no history of wide-scale distribution through machines.
