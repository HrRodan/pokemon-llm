## Identity & Mechanics
**Acupressure** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user applies precise physical pressure to the target's meridian points or physiological stress centers to unlock latent potential. This stimulation triggers a sudden surge in performance, manifesting as a sharp increase in a random attribute. It is a high-variance technique that rewards luck with potentially game-ending stat boosts, including rare increases to Evasion and Accuracy.
* **Effect:** Randomly selects one of the target's stats (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, or Evasion) and raises it by two stages ("sharply"). It fails if all stats are already at +6 or if the target is behind a Substitute.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is a 100% chance to boost a stat).
* **Targeting:** User or Ally (Highly unique utility in Doubles/VGC).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** Gimmick Setup / High-Variance Utility.
* **Usage:** Acupressure is rarely seen in standard "Smogon-style" singles due to its unpredictability; reliable boosters like **Swords Dance** or **Calm Mind** are generally preferred. However, it holds a niche in "Evasion-allowed" formats or Battle Facility (Battle Tower/Tree) sets. Its most dangerous attribute is the ability to boost **Evasion** and **Accuracy**, stats that are otherwise difficult to increase. In Doubles, it can be used to turn a teammate into an unstoppable "omni-boosted" sweeper.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails against a target behind a Substitute; cannot be copied by Mirror Move. It does not deal damage, so it has no **Super Effective** matchups.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (22 total learners), primarily found among Pokémon with spiked bodies, tentacles, or medicinal themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Drapion**, **Shuckle**, and **Tentacruel**. Drapion often uses it in Battle Facility sets alongside "Battle Armor" to prevent critical hits while fishing for Evasion or Defense boosts.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Malamar** or **Maractus** in lower-tier gimmicks. **Qwilfish** (and its Hisuian form/Overqwil) can utilize it as a high-risk option while stalling with toxic damage.
* **Acquisition:** It is primarily learned via leveling up; it is not a standard TM or TR in most generations, making its distribution quite exclusive to its natural learners.
