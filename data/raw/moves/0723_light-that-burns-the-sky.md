## Identity & Mechanics
**Light That Burns the Sky** is a Special Psychic-type Signature Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** The user, Ultra Necrozma, gathers a colossal amount of light energy, manifesting as a miniature sun before detonating it in a catastrophic beam that engulfs the target. This move represents the absolute pinnacle of Necrozma's power, burning through all defenses with intense cosmic radiation.
* **Effect:** This is an exclusive Z-Move that can only be used by **Ultra Necrozma**. It deals damage based on either the user's Attack or Special Attack stat, whichever is currently higher. It notably **ignores the target's Ability** (functioning like Mold Breaker), allowing it to bypass defensive hurdles like Sturdy, Multiscale, or Disguise.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure Damage).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 200, Accuracy --% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 1.
* **Role:** **Signature Z-Move Nuke / Ultimate Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Used as the ultimate "finishing move" or "delete button" in competitive formats like Ubers (Gen 7). Because it scales with the higher offensive stat, it is equally devastating on physical or special Necrozma sets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Z-Move and can only be activated if Necrozma has transformed into its **Ultra form** and is carrying the **Ultranecrozium Z** crystal, using **Photon Geyser** as the base move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (Exclusively for Necrozma).
* **Prominent Users:** Only utilized by **Ultra Necrozma**. To access the move, the Pokémon must start as Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings Necrozma, use "Ultra Burst" while holding the Ultranecrozium Z, and then execute the Z-Move.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature Z-Move, it is never used for "coverage" by other species. However, its Ability-ignoring properties make it the premier tool for Necrozma to bypass checks like **Mimikyu** or **Lugia**.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon* via the signature Z-Crystal. It is not available in subsequent generations due to the removal of the Z-Move mechanic.
