## Identity & Mechanics
**Trick-or-Treat** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user playfully lures the target into a festive holiday atmosphere, haunting them with spectral energy. This supernatural influence is so potent that it physically manifests as a secondary or tertiary typing, adding the **Ghost type** to the target's existing type profile. This can result in a Pokémon having three simultaneous types.
* **Effect:** Adds the Ghost type to the target. If the target is already a Ghost-type, the move fails. This effect persists until the target switches out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Can target an opponent to create weaknesses or an ally to provide immunities/STAB).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Type Manipulation.
* **Usage:** Trick-or-Treat is a highly niche tactical move used to disrupt defensive cores. By adding the Ghost type to a foe, the user grants that foe new weaknesses to **Ghost** and **Dark** attacks. This is often used as a "setup" for a partner in Doubles or to allow the user to hit a target for Super Effective damage with its own STAB moves. Conversely, it can be used on an ally to grant them immunity to Normal and Fighting-type moves. 
* **Type Matchups:** By making the target a Ghost-type, they become **Super Effective** targets for **Ghost** and **Dark** moves.
* **Attributes:** This move is blocked by *Crafty Shield* and *Magic Coat*, and it is reflected by the *Magic Bounce* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of the **Pumpkaboo** line (8 total learners across various sizes).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Gourgeist** (Small, Average, Large, and Super Sizes) and **Pumpkaboo**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to the Pumpkaboo evolution line, it is rarely seen outside of dedicated trick-room or gimmick sets. Gourgeist often uses it to make a target vulnerable to its own **Phantom Force** or **Shadow Sneak**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned exclusively through leveling up by its signature users.
