## Identity & Mechanics
**Wonder Room** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user manifests a bizarre, reality-warping dimension that distorts the physical and mystical properties of all combatants. This field effect creates a tactical vacuum where the structural integrity (Defense) and mental fortitude (Special Defense) of every Pokémon on the field are inverted.
* **Effect:** For five turns, every Pokémon’s base Defense and Special Defense stats are swapped. This affects all active Pokémon, including the user and allies.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (Affects all Pokémon in play).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Niche Utility / Wallbreaking Support.
* **Usage:** Wonder Room is a high-level tactical move used to dismantle "Stall" teams and defensive cores. It is specifically effective against Pokémon with extreme stat lopsidedness, such as **Blissey** or **Chansey**; by swapping their massive Special Defense with their abysmal physical Defense, a special attacker can suddenly "nuke" them using special moves. Unlike *Trick Room*, it has normal priority (0), allowing the user to set the field before being moved against.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is a **Psychic-type** move, making it subject to effects like *Taunt* or *Magic Bounce*.
* **Attributes:** Field Effect. Does not make contact. Bypasses accuracy checks.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (126 learners), primarily found among Psychic, Ghost, and Fairy types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by high-IQ Psychic types and mystical Fairies like **Alakazam**, **Gardevoir**, **Clefable**, and **Mewtwo**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon with highly asymmetrical defenses like **Nihilego**, **Stakataka**, or **Carbink**. These users can utilize the move to survive hits from their "weaker" side or to manipulate the opponent's defensive weaknesses.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in various generations, most notably as **TM71** in Pokémon Sword and Shield.
