## Identity & Mechanics
**Mimic** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses intently on the opponent's movements, psychologically and physically replicating the last technique executed by the target. This allow the user to temporarily add a foreign move to its own repertoire, creating unpredictable tactical shifts.
* **Effect:** This move is replaced by the target’s last successfully used move for the remainder of the battle (or until the user switches out). The newly acquired move's PP is set to 5. The move fails if the target has not used a move, if the move is already known by the user, or if the target used specific "un-copyable" moves such as Metronome, Sketch, Struggle, or Chatter.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Technical Niche.
* **Usage:** Mimic is a high-variance utility move used to steal powerful STAB attacks or recovery options from an opponent. While generally considered too inconsistent for standard play compared to dedicated coverage moves, it can serve as a "wildcard" in restricted movepool formats or for Pokémon with shallow offensive options. It is notably outclassed by **Sketch** (which makes the change permanent) and **Mirror Move** (which executes the move immediately without replacing the slot). As a Status move, it does not deal direct damage and thus ignores Type Matchups.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; cannot be copied by Mirror Move or forced by Encore.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (395 learners), primarily due to its status as a TM in the earliest generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Mr. Mime** (its signature thematic user), **Mew** (the ultimate movepool specialist), and **Clefable**. It is also a thematic fit for **Mimikyu**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on Pokémon like **Snorlax** or **Sudowoodo** in older generations to snatch specific utility moves (like recovery or entry hazards) that they otherwise lack.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM31** in Generation I and through various Move Tutors in subsequent generations (notably Emerald and FireRed/LeafGreen). In modern generations, its availability has significantly decreased, often relegated to "Transfer Only" status.
