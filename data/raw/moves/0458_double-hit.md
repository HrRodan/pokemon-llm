## Identity & Mechanics
**Double-Hit** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rapid succession of physical strikes, slamming the target twice in a single turn using its tail, limbs, or body. This multi-strike assault is designed to overwhelm opponents through repeated impact, ensuring that even if one blow is mitigated, the second follows immediately to maintain offensive pressure.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. It hits the target exactly twice per use. Each hit has an independent chance to be a Critical Hit.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance). However, it is uniquely capable of breaking through **Substitutes**, **Focus Sashes**, and the **Sturdy** ability by dealing damage with the second strike after the first strike exhausts the protection.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35 (Per hit, total 70), Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Multi-Strike Utility / Technician Abuser.
* **Usage:** While its base power (70 total) is lower than reliable STAB options like *Return* or *Body Slam*, it excels in niche roles. It is primarily used to bypass defensive items or "Focus Sash" leads. Because each hit is 35 power, it is a premier choice for Pokémon with the **Technician** ability, boosting each hit's power to 52.5 (105 total). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **None** (Normal moves hit for neutral damage against most types), and is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, while **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** Contact (triggers Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, etc.).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), often found on Pokémon with agile or multi-limbed physiology.
* **Prominent Users:** **Ambipom** (essential for evolution from Aipom and its best Technician-boosted STAB), **Maushold**, **Girafarig/Farigiraf**, and **Kangaskhan** (Parental Bond interaction).
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Dragapult** or **Hydrapple** as a filler move or for specific evolution requirements (Aipom to Ambipom requires knowing this move).
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is not a standard TM/TR move in most generations, making its distribution more exclusive to specific evolutionary lines.
