## Identity & Mechanics
**Hone Claws** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user rhythmically sharpens its talons, claws, or pincers, honing its physical edge and focusing its predatory instincts. This mental and physical preparation results in a simultaneous increase in raw physical power and visual precision, ensuring subsequent strikes are both more lethal and harder to evade.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s **Attack** and **Accuracy** stats by one stage each (+1 Atk, +1 Acc).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Setup / Precision Sweeper**. 
* **Usage:** While often overshadowed by *Swords Dance* (which provides a +2 Attack boost), Hone Claws occupies a unique niche for Pokémon that rely on high-power, low-accuracy moves. It effectively "fixes" the reliability of moves like **Stone Edge**, **Dragon Rush**, **Iron Tail**, and **Gunk Shot**. It is also the premier setup move for Pokémon with the **Hustle** ability, as the accuracy boost negates the ability's accuracy penalty while further stacking the Attack modifiers.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage directly, but it is frequently used to set up Dark-type physical attackers to deal **Super Effective** damage against **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not blocked by *Protect* or *Detect* (as it targets the user) and is not affected by *King's Rock*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very wide** distribution (213 learners), primarily granted to Pokémon with visible claws, blades, or sharp appendages.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Durant:** Perhaps the most famous user, utilizing Hone Claws to counteract the accuracy drop from its *Hustle* ability, making it a terrifying wallbreaker.
    * **Corviknight:** Occasionally uses it in bulky offensive sets to boost its Attack while ensuring *Brave Bird* or *Body Press* never miss.
    * **Meowscarada:** A modern STAB user that can use the boost to sweep late-game.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Garchomp** or **Dragonite** in specific formats where ensuring the accuracy of **Dragon Rush** or **Aqua Tail** is prioritized over the raw speed of *Dragon Dance*.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM01** in Generation V and VI; however, it became more restricted in later generations, often appearing as a natural level-up move or through specific Move Tutors.
