## Identity & Mechanics
**Skull Bash** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lowers its head and tucks its body in, significantly hardening its shell or skull to bolster its physical resilience. On the following turn, the user lunges forward with immense momentum to deliver a devastating headbutt. This move is characterized by a "charge-and-strike" sequence that rewards patience with both offensive pressure and defensive utility.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn move. On the first turn, the user prepares the attack and immediately gains a defensive boost. On the second turn, the user deals damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the user’s **Defense** by one stage during the charging turn.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Delayed Nuke / Defense-Boosting Setup.
* **Usage:** While boasting a massive 130 Base Power, Skull Bash is rarely used in standard competitive play due to its two-turn requirement, which makes the user vulnerable to *Protect*, *Substitute*, or being forced out (phazed) via *Roar*. However, it can be paired with a **Power Herb** to bypass the charging turn, providing an immediate 130 BP hit alongside a free Defense boost. Compared to **Body Slam**, it offers more raw power but lacks the utility of paralysis; compared to **Double-Edge**, it lacks recoil but requires a turn of setup. It deals **neutral damage** to most types and is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, while **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rough Skin*, *Iron Barbs*, or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, with 116 Pokémon capable of learning it across various generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic on **Blastoise**, where it is a signature thematic move (notably in the *Super Smash Bros.* series). Other high-durability users include **Snorlax**, **Lapras**, and **Rhydon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on physical attackers like **Tapu Bulu**, **Sharpedo**, and **Arcanine**. In lower-tier formats, it is sometimes used by **Bouffalant** or **Greedent** to capitalize on their natural bulk.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM40** in Generation I (Kanto), it has since become more exclusive, often appearing as an Egg Move or a Level-Up move for "hard-headed" or "shelled" Pokémon.
