## Identity & Mechanics
**Gigaton Hammer** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user exerts immense physical force, swinging a massive, makeshift iron hammer with its entire body weight to crush the target. The sheer momentum and weight of the weapon deliver a devastating impact, making it one of the most powerful Steel-type attacks in Pokémon history. Due to the physical strain of wielding such a gargantuan tool, the user requires a "cool-down" period between swings.
* **Effect:** The user cannot use this move consecutively. If the move is successful, the user must select a different move or switch out on the following turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 160, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Signature Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** With a staggering 160 Base Power and perfect accuracy, Gigaton Hammer is designed to punch holes through defensive cores. Unlike other high-power moves like *Giga Impact* or *Meteor Mash*, it does not require a recharge turn or have a chance to miss; however, its "anti-spam" mechanic forces the user into a tactical "hit-and-run" or "move-cycling" playstyle. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is heavily influenced by items like *Choice Band* (to maximize the single-hit nuke potential) or *Assault Vest* (to survive the turns where the move cannot be used).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, functioning as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Tinkaton**. The move is central to Tinkaton's viability, as its base Attack stat (75) is relatively modest; Gigaton Hammer provides the raw mathematical power necessary to threaten Tier 1 threats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not seen as coverage on other Pokémon. However, on Tinkaton, it is often paired with moves like *Knock Off*, *Play Rough*, or *Thunder Wave* to provide utility during the turns Gigaton Hammer is unavailable.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned automatically upon evolution or via level-up by Tinkaton.
