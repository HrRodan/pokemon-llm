## Identity & Mechanics
**Psych-Up** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental energy to synchronize its cellular or spiritual rhythm with the target. By doing so, the user mimics the target’s current physical and mental state, effectively mirroring any fluctuations in their abilities. This adds searchable keywords like mind-reading, mimicry, synchronization, and stat manipulation.
* **Effect:** The user resets its own stat stages and copies all of the target's current stat modifiers (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion). It can copy both positive boosts and negative drops.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is important to note that Psych-Up **bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks** and **hits through a Substitute**.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (including allies in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Setup / Synergy Piece.
* **Usage:** While niche in Single battles, Psych-Up is a high-level tactical tool in **Doubles/VGC**. It is primarily used to copy a partner's massive stat boosts (such as those from *Geomancy* or *Weakness Policy*) or to punish an opponent's "Wallbreaker" that has spent turns setting up. It serves as a soft check to "Calm Mind" or "Bulk Up" sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **N/A** (Status move), but effectively counters setup-heavy archetypes.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Substitute; cannot be copied by Mirror Move; fails if the target has no stat changes.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very wide** distribution (384 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves via TM/TR across multiple generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on versatile Psychic and Normal types such as **Mew**, **Clefable**, **Gengar**, and **Alakazam**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often utilized by support Pokémon or bulky attackers like **Snorlax** and **Blissey** to mirror an opponent’s defensive boosts, or by **Oricorio** in Doubles to double-down on stat-increasing "Dance" moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM or TR** (TM16 in early gens, TM07 in others, TM203 in Gen 9) in almost every core series game since its debut.
