## Identity & Mechanics
**Mat Block** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos Region).
* **Description:** The user pulls up a large tatami mat from the ground to act as a makeshift shield, creating a physical barrier that intercepts incoming strikes. This technique reflects high-level martial arts or shinobi training, using the environment to neutralize offensive pressure.
* **Effect:** Protects the user and all friendly Pokémon on their side of the field from the damage of physical and special attacks during the turn it is used. It **fails** if used after the first turn the user has been active on the field (similar to the timing requirement of *Fake Out*).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. Notably, it does **not** protect against status moves (e.g., *Will-O-Wisp*, *Taunt*, or *Spore*).
* **Targeting:** Users-field (Affects all allies).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Support Utility / Setup Enabler.**
* **Usage:** Primarily a niche pick in Double Battles and VGC. Unlike *Protect* or *Wide Guard*, Mat Block has **0 Priority**, meaning the user must be naturally faster than the opponents to successfully "block" their attacks. It is often used to buy a "free turn" for a partner to use a setup move like *Dragon Dance*, *Tailwind*, or *Trick Room*. It is frequently compared to *Fake Out*, but instead of flinching one target, it attempts to shield the entire team.
* **Attributes:** This move is blocked by *Protect* and *Detect*, and it can be bypassed by Pokémon with the *Infiltrator* ability or moves like *Feint*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (only 4 known learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Greninja** (including Ash-Greninja), who utilizes its elite Speed tier to ensure the move executes before the opponent can move. It is also learned by **Throh**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a specialized tactical move rather than an offensive one, it is never used for "coverage" but rather as a specific lead-slot tech for high-speed disruptive playstyles.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or HM; it is restricted to the level-up movepools of its specific evolutionary lines.
