## Identity & Mechanics
**Razor Wind** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user whips up a vortex of pressurized air, creating sharp vacuum blades that lash out at the opposition. This move operates on a two-turn cycle: the user spends the first turn gathering intensity ("preparing") and unleashes the atmospheric onslaught on the second turn.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage on the second turn after a charge turn. It possesses a **high critical-hit ratio** (+1 stage), making it more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat boosts. This move cannot be called by Sleep Talk.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (The high crit rate is a built-in mechanic rather than a percentage-based secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double/Triple Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Niche Spread Damage / Two-Turn Charge Move.
* **Usage:** Generally considered a low-tier competitive move. Despite its high critical hit ratio and perfect accuracy, the "charge turn" requirement makes it highly predictable, allowing opponents to switch to a **Ghost-type** (immune), a **Steel/Rock-type** (resistant), or use *Protect* to negate the damage entirely. It is significantly outclassed by moves like *Hyper Voice* (which hits the same targets in one turn) or *Boomburst*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **nothing**, as it is a Normal-type move.
* **Attributes:** Wind-based (Interacts with abilities like Wind Power/Wind Rider in later generations), High Crit Ratio, Banned from Sleep Talk.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (51 learners), primarily consisting of Flying-types and Pokémon with blade-like appendages.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Pidgeot (and Mega Pidgeot)**, **Scyther/Scizor**, and **Noivern**, who utilize their wings or speed to generate the vacuum.
* **Thematic Users:** Pokémon known for "wind" or "blade" themes like **Absol**, **Shiftry**, and **Talonflame** often have access to this move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Dragon-types like **Dragonite** or **Drampa**, though it is rarely chosen over their much stronger STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) or elemental coverage options.
* **Acquisition:** Originally highly accessible as **TM02** in Generation I (Kanto), its availability as a TM/move tutor has diminished in recent generations.
