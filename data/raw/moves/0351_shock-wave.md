## Identity & Mechanics
**Shock Wave** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user strikes the target with a rapid, oscillating discharge of electricity that is impossible to evade. Because the bolts track the target’s bio-electrical signature, they bypass standard physical evasion, making it a reliable tool against agile or obscured opponents.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to hit the target regardless of accuracy or evasion modifiers. It only fails if the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (e.g., Dig, Fly).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy —% (Infinite), PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliability Tool / Anti-Evasion Tech.
* **Usage:** In standard competitive play, Shock Wave is generally considered a niche pick. It is significantly weaker than **Thunderbolt** (90 Power) or **Discharge** (80 Power). However, it serves as a hard counter to "Evasion Cheese" strategies involving *Minimize* or *Double Team*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; does not trigger abilities like Static or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (336 learners), as it was a primary TM (TM34) in Generations III and IV.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Electric-type users include **Raichu**, **Zapdos**, **Manectric**, and **Tapu Koko**, who often use it as a mid-game leveling move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a legacy TM, it is found on a surprising variety of non-Electric Pokémon for coverage, such as **Alakazam**, **Gengar**, and **Nidoking**, allowing them to hit Flying-types without risking a miss. **Hydreigon** and **Tyranitar** also have access to it to bypass accuracy-lowering status effects.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM34** in Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Johto (HGSS) regions, and later available through Move Tutors in various games.
