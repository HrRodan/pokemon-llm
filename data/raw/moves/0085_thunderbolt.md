## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunderbolt** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user releases a powerful, concentrated blast of high-voltage electricity at the target. This surge of energy is more stable than a natural lightning strike, manifesting as a controlled beam or bolt that crackles with intense heat and light, often leaving the opponent reeling from the shock.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent Special damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10% chance** to induce the **Paralysis** status condition, which quarters the target's Speed and may prevent them from moving.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / **Consistency Option**.
* **Usage:** Thunderbolt is considered the "Gold Standard" for Special Electric attacks. It is chosen over *Thunder* for its perfect accuracy and over *Discharge* for its higher base power in singles. In competitive history, it is famously paired with Ice Beam to form the **"Bolt-Beam"** coverage core, which hits the vast majority of the Pokédex for at least neutral damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many defensive checks that rely on evasion since it does not have the accuracy drawbacks of its rivals. It is not a contact move, avoiding triggers like *Rough Skin* or *Rocky Helmet*.
