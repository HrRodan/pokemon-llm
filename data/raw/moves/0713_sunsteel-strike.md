## Identity & Mechanics
**Sunsteel Strike** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user gathers the radiant energy of the sun and launches itself like a devastating meteor, slamming into the target with overwhelming force. This move is characterized by its solar-themed brilliance and kinetic impact, visually represented by the user entering its "Radiant Sun" phase.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage while completely ignoring the effects of the target's Ability. This "Mold Breaker" style mechanic allows the move to bypass defensive hurdles that usually mitigate or negate damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but its primary mechanic allows it to ignore defensive abilities like **Disguise**, **Sturdy**, **Multiscale**, **Unaware**, **Levitate**, and **Filter**.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** As a signature move with 100/100 stats, it serves as the gold standard for Physical Steel-type offense. It is strictly superior to *Iron Head* (due to power) and *Meteor Mash* (due to accuracy and the ability-ignoring effect). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types. It is particularly valued in high-tier competitive play for OHKOing **Mimikyu** through its Disguise and punishing **Clefable** despite its Unaware ability.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**. Not affected by Iron Fist. Bypasses protection-based abilities but not protection moves (like Protect).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 primary learner in base data).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively the signature move of **Solgaleo**. However, it is also the primary offensive tool for **Necrozma (Dusk Mane)** and the ultra-powerful **Ultra Necrozma**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is rarely seen outside of these Legendary Pokémon. However, it can be accessed by **Smeargle** via *Sketch* in formats where Smeargle is permitted.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned strictly via leveling up or form transformation (for Necrozma). In Generation VIII and IX, it remains a signature move tied to the "Cosmog" evolutionary line and its fusions.
