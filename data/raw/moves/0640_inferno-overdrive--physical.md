## Identity & Mechanics
**Inferno Overdrive (Physical)** is a Physical Fire-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** Drawing upon the concentrated Z-Power of a Firium Z crystal, the user exhales or unleashes a monumental, explosive stream of intense fire. This ultimate Fire-type attack creates a massive combustion upon impact, incinerating the target with the full force of the user's kinetic and thermal energy.
* **Effect:** This move is a **Z-Move** version of a base physical Fire-type attack (such as Flare Blitz or Fire Punch). It can only be used once per battle and its Base Power is determined by the move it upgrades.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, like most Z-Moves, it **bypasses accuracy checks** and can strike through protection moves like *Protect* or *Detect*, dealing 25% of its original damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single-target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–190+], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Physical Wallbreaker / High-Risk Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Inferno Overdrive is used to secure OHKOs on bulky threats that would otherwise survive a standard STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. In the Gen VII meta, it was frequently used to bypass the recoil of *Flare Blitz* for one turn or to overwhelm defensive "checks." It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Steel, Grass, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is non-contact (even if the base move was contact) and is considered a Z-Move mechanic.

## Distribution & Notable Users
The distribution of this move is **Universal** among Pokémon that can learn a physical Fire-type move and are holding a **Firium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Blaziken:** Frequently used *Flare Blitz* as the base to reach a staggering 190 Base Power, allowing it to blast through defensive Landorus-Therian or Toxapex after a *Swords Dance*.
    * **Arcanine:** Utilized this to provide a massive burst of damage without the crippling recoil associated with its standard physical sets.
    * **Incineroar:** In the Alolan meta, it used this to punish Steel-types like Celesteela or Ferrothorn.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Landorus-Therian** or **Tyranitar** using *Fire Punch* as a base move to surprise and lure in Grass or Steel-type walls that expect to resist their primary STABs.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the player to obtain the **Firium Z** crystal (typically found in Wela Volcano Park in the Alola region).
