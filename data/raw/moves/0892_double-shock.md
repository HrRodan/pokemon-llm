## Identity & Mechanics
**Double Shock** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The user channels its entire internal reservoir of electricity, releasing a catastrophic, high-voltage discharge from its body to strike the opponent. This massive expenditure of energy is so taxing that it completely depletes the user's electrical reserves, leaving them physically drained and temporarily stripped of their elemental affinity.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to the target. After use, the user loses its **Electric typing**. If the user is a dual-type, it becomes a single-type Pokémon; if it was a pure Electric-type, it becomes "Typeless." This move will **fail** if the user is not currently an Electric-type (unless it has Terastallized into an Electric-type).
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Guaranteed typing change on successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **120**, Accuracy **100%**, PP **5** (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Power STAB Nuke / Signature Move.**
* **Usage:** Double Shock is the Electric-type equivalent of the move *Burn Up*. It offers incredible wallbreaking power without the recoil associated with *Wild Charge* or *Volt Tackle*. However, the tactical cost is high: losing the Electric typing means losing STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for subsequent Electric moves and losing the valuable resistances to Electric, Steel, and Flying types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, serving as a signature move within its debut generation (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, the only Pokémon capable of learning this move is **Pawmot**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move is restricted to the Pawmot evolutionary line, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, Pawmot utilizes its dual **Electric/Fighting** typing to threaten common defensive cores. Once Double Shock is used, Pawmot becomes a pure Fighting-type, which can be strategically used to remove its weakness to Ground-type attacks before an opponent can retaliate.
* **Acquisition:** This is a natural level-up move for **Pawmot** (attained upon evolution); it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor.
