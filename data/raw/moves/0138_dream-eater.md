## Identity & Mechanics
**Dream Eater** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user psychically invades the subconscious of a slumbering opponent, consuming their dreams to siphon away life energy. This restorative attack manifests as a dark, mystical aura that drains the target's vitality while they remain in a state of deep sleep, providing both offensive pressure and vital health recovery for the user.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage on the target. This move fails if the target is not currently affected by the Sleep status condition. The user recovers 50% of the damage dealt as HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Effect Chance: N/A).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Conditional HP-Drain Nuke**.
* **Usage:** While boasting high base power and a powerful recovery effect, Dream Eater is considered high-risk in competitive play due to its dependency on the target being asleep. It is frequently outclassed by **Psychic** or **Psyshock** for consistent STAB damage. However, it sees niche use on "Sleep-Trap" sets or in formats without a "Sleep Clause." It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Draining Move**, meaning its recovery can be boosted by the **Big Root** held item.
