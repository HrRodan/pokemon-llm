## Identity & Mechanics
**Extrasensory** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user attacks by emitting a peculiar, otherworldly energy wave that interferes with the target's senses. This supernatural pulse emanates from the user's hidden mental power, often catching opponents off-guard with its strange, rhythmic frequency. It is a staple move for Pokémon with mystical, ancient, or avian themes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to make the target **Flinch**, preventing them from acting for the remainder of the turn.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Extrasensory serves as a high-PP alternative to *Psychic* (90 BP) or *Psyshock* (80 BP). While it lacks the raw power of *Psychic*, its higher PP (20 vs. 10) makes it more sustainable in long-form matches or "Stall" wars. The 10% flinch chance provides a "hail mary" win condition, especially when used by faster attackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a Special move that does not make contact. It is not boosted by *Iron Fist* or blocked by *Bulletproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (65 learners), appearing on a surprisingly diverse array of non-Psychic types.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by Legendary Pokémon like **Lugia** and **Ho-Oh**, and Psychic-type staples like **Tapu Lele** and **Togekiss**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically significant as a rare special coverage move for the **Typhlosion** line and **Ninetales**, allowing them to check Fighting or Poison types that would otherwise wall their Fire-type STAB. It is also a key coverage tool for **Greninja** to hit threats like Toxapex or Buzzwole.
* **Acquisition:** While it lacks a widespread TM/TR presence in several generations, it is a common **Egg Move** or level-up move for Pokémon with "mystical" flavor profiles.
