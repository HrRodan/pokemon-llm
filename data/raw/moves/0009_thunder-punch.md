## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunder Punch** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses a surge of high-voltage electricity into its fist, delivering an electrically charged haymaker that crackles upon impact. This discharge of energy can scramble the target's nervous system, leaving them immobilized. As a contact-based "punching" move, it benefits from specific ability boosts like Iron Fist.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10% chance** to induce the **Paralysis** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable Coverage / Safe STAB.
* **Usage:** Thunder Punch serves as the primary physical Electric-type alternative to *Wild Charge*. While it possesses lower base power than Wild Charge, it is preferred on sets that cannot afford recoil damage. It is a staple "Elemental Punch" used to provide wide-reaching coverage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is specifically categorized as a **Punching move**, meaning its damage is increased by 20% when used by a Pokémon with the **Iron Fist** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (**264 learners**), making it one of the most accessible physical coverage moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Electivire**, **Iron Hands**, and **Pawmot**, all of whom utilize it as a reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. **Hitmonchan** is also a classic user due to its Iron Fist ability.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon like **Dragonite**, **Tyranitar**, and **Machamp**. These physical attackers carry Thunder Punch specifically to lure and "check" defensive Water-types (like Toxapex or Slowbro) or Flying-types (like Corviknight) that would otherwise wall their primary attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in almost every generation, and frequently taught by Move Tutors in competitive-focused titles.
