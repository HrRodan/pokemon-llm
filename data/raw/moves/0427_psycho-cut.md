## Identity & Mechanics
**Psycho-Cut** is a Physical Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user manifests psychic energy into tangible, sharpened blades or crescent waves that tear through the opposition. This move emphasizes precision and sharpness over raw telekinetic force, allowing the user to slice through the foe's defenses. Due to its "cutting" nature, it is categorized as a **Slicing Move**, receiving power bonuses from specific abilities like Sharpness.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with an increased critical-hit ratio.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a boosted critical-hit rate (+1 stage), giving it a 12.5% chance to crit (or higher with items/abilities) compared to the standard 4.17%.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Slicing Coverage.
* **Usage:** Psycho-Cut serves as the primary Physical Psychic STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) for Pokémon that prioritize accuracy over the raw power and flinch chance of *Zen Headbutt* (80 BP/90% Acc). In modern competitive play, it is significantly buffed by the ability **Sharpness**, which increases its base power by 50%, effectively making it a 105 BP move with perfect accuracy. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a **Slicing Move** (boosted by Sharpness). Despite its name, it does **not** make direct contact, allowing the user to bypass negative effects from abilities like *Static*, *Flame Body*, or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (67 learners), primarily found among Psychic-types and Pokémon with blade-like appendages.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Gallade** (its signature user, especially with the Sharpness ability), **Mewtwo (Mega-X)**, and **Iron Boulder**. It is also a staple for **Malamar** and **Veluza**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Bisharp/Kingambit**, **Absol**, and **Haxorus** to provide a high-accuracy option to hit Fighting-type threats that usually resist their primary STABs.
* **Acquisition:** It has appeared as a TM in multiple generations (most notably TM69 in Sword/Shield), making it highly accessible for Physical attackers needing Psychic-type coverage.
