## Identity & Mechanics
**Stuff Cheeks** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user consumes its held Berry in a display of gluttony, utilizing the stored nutrition to physically bolster its body. This action results in a significant increase in physical durability, characterized by the user stuffing its facial pouches to their limit.
* **Effect:** The user eats its held Berry immediately, regardless of the Berry's usual trigger conditions, and then **sharply raises its Defense stat** (by two stages). 
* **Secondary Effect:** If the user is not holding a Berry, the move fails entirely. It triggers Berry-related abilities like **Cheek Pouch** (restoring HP) or **Ripen** (doubling the Berry's effect) upon use.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Setup / Utility / Recovery Catalyst.**
* **Usage:** Stuff Cheeks is a highly specialized setup move. While it mirrors *Iron Defense* by providing a +2 Defense boost, its primary value lies in the **forced consumption** of a Berry. This allows for immediate activation of defensive items like the **Sitrus Berry** for health or the **Ganlon Berry** for an additional Defense boost. It is most effective when paired with the Ability **Cheek Pouch**, essentially turning the move into a "Bulk Up" that also heals the user.
* **Context:** It is generally compared to *Iron Defense* or *Stockpile*. While *Iron Defense* is more reliable (doesn't require an item), Stuff Cheeks offers superior immediate burst-value through item synergy. As a Normal-type status move, it does not deal damage and therefore does not have type matchups, but it is effectively countered by the move **Knock Off** or the ability **Unnerve**.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypassed by *Snatch*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (only 4 Pokémon in the total learner list).
* **Prominent Users:** The move is the signature tactical choice for **Greedent** and its pre-evolution **Skwovet**, who utilize it alongside the *Cheek Pouch* ability to become formidable physical walls. It is also learned by **Lechonk** (and its evolution Oinkologne) and **Gulpin** (and its evolution Swalot).
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it requires a held Berry to function, it is almost never seen on Pokémon without specific Berry-related abilities. It is specifically used to counter physical attackers who cannot break through the sudden +2 Defense boost and immediate healing.
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM or TR**; it is learned exclusively through level-up by a small group of "gluttonous" themed Pokémon.
