## Identity & Mechanics
**Accelerock** is a physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user gathers incredible momentum and smashes into the target with the force of a landslide at blinding speed. As a signature move of the Lycanroc line, it represents the agility of the midday and dusk forms, utilizing rock-hard projectiles or the user's own body as a high-velocity kinetic weapon.
* **Effect:** This move has a priority of +1, meaning it will typically strike before most other moves in the same turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Priority Finisher / Revenge Killer.
* **Usage:** Accelerock is highly valued as the only Rock-type priority move in the game. It allows the user to bypass its Speed tier to pick off weakened threats or "check" faster Fire-, Flying-, Ice-, and Bug-type sweepers. It is particularly effective at dismantling Focus Sash users or Pokémon like Talonflame, Volcarona, and Mega Charizard Y. 
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Flying, Bug, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, with only 2 known learners in the entire Pokédex.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively used by **Lycanroc (Midday Form)** and **Lycanroc (Dusk Form)**. It is a defining characteristic of these forms, as the Midnight Form notably lacks access to this move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor, it cannot be used for coverage by other types. Its utility is strictly limited to Lycanroc, providing it with vital **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** priority that compensates for its relatively frail defensive stats.
* **Acquisition:** This move is learned upon evolution or at Level 1, depending on the specific Lycanroc form and game version. It is not available to any other Pokémon through breeding or machines.
