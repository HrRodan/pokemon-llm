## Identity & Mechanics
**Whirlpool** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user creates a powerful, swirling vortex of water that engulfs the target. Beyond the initial impact, the target is caught in a relentless aquatic spiral that prevents retreat and causes continuous damage through centrifugal force and water pressure. This move is optimized for "Trapping" strategies where the goal is to isolate a specific opponent on the field.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and traps the target for 2–5 turns. While trapped, the target cannot switch out or flee and takes residual damage equal to 1/16th of its maximum HP at the end of each turn (increased to 1/8th in certain generations/with Binding Band). The effect ends immediately if the user leaves the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** If the target is in the first turn of the move **Dive**, Whirlpool hits with double power (70 Base Power).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35, Accuracy 85%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Trapping Utility / Disruptor.**
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Whirlpool is a cornerstone of "Perish Trap" and "Stall-Break" strategies. It is frequently paired with moves like **Perish Song**, **Nature’s Madness**, or **Toxic**. Unlike pure damage moves, its primary value is removing the opponent's ability to switch, allowing the user to dictate the match's tempo or eliminate a specific wall. It is the Water-type equivalent of *Fire Spin*, *Magma Storm*, or *Sand Tomb*.
* **Type Matchups:** Deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a "Binding Move" and its residual damage can be boosted by the **Binding Band** item or extended by the **Grip Claw**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Whirlpool has a wide distribution among Water-types and several draconic or heavy Pokémon, with **188** known learners.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Azumarill:** The premier user of "Perish Trap" sets, using Whirlpool to lock a foe in before clicking Perish Song and using Protect/Substitute.
    * **Tapu Fini:** Often uses Whirlpool in conjunction with Nature's Madness to reliably chunk and remove specific defensive threats.
    * **Milotic / Suicune:** Utilized in defensive "Stall" archetypes to trap a passive opponent and whittle them down with status and residual damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Water types like **Dragonite** or **Garchomp** in niche competitive formats to trap and eliminate specific counters that expect a standard physical sweep.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in Generation II, HeartGold/SoulSilver, Sword/Shield, and Scarlet/Violet. It was also a mandatory **HM** (Hidden Machine) in the Johto region for navigating sea currents.
