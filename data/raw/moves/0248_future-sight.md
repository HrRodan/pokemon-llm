## Identity & Mechanics
**Future Sight** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user heightens its mental focus to peer into the timeline, manifesting a concentrated orb of psychic energy that lingers in a temporal rift. This energy remains dormant for two turns before violently collapsing onto the target's position, ensuring a devastating delayed impact that is difficult to avoid.
* **Effect:** Two turns after the move is used, the target (or its replacement) takes damage at the end of the turn. In modern generations, the damage is Psychic-type and benefits from STAB. The damage calculation uses the Special Attack and Special Defense stats from the turn the move was **initiated**, not the turn it lands. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but it possesses unique properties: it ignores **Endure** and **Focus Sash** because the damage occurs at the end of the turn, and it penetrates **Protect**, **Detect**, and **Wonder Guard** on the turn of impact.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Delayed Nuke / Pressure Pivot.
* **Usage:** Future Sight is a centerpiece of "hazard stacking" and "checkmate" offensive cores. It is rarely used for immediate damage; instead, it is used to force an opponent into a losing scenario. If the opponent stays in, they take massive damage; if they switch to a resist (like a Dark-type), the user can predict the switch and use a Fighting-type move on the same turn Future Sight lands, hitting the switch-in twice. It is most effective when paired with **Teleport** or **U-turn** to bring in a powerful wallbreaker safely.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses protection on the turn of impact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Psychic-types (129 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently used by **Slowking (Galar)** and **Slowbro**, who utilize it alongside *Regenerator* to maintain momentum. It is also a staple on **Alakazam**, **Reuniclus**, and the Paradox Pokémon **Iron Crown**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Psychic Pokémon with high mental flavoring like **Absol** or **Golduck**, though they rarely have the Special Attack to capitalize on it compared to STAB users.
* **Acquisition:** It has become highly accessible in modern competitive play, appearing as **TM15** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and **TM217** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
