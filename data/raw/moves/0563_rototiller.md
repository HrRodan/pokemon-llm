## Identity & Mechanics
**Rototiller** is a Status Ground-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user vigorously tills the soil, aerating the earth to create a nutrient-rich environment optimized for botanical growth. This agricultural maneuver mimics the effects of fertilization, stimulating the biological potential of any plant-based life forms on the battlefield. 
* **Effect:** Raises the **Attack** and **Special Attack** stats of all **Grass-type** Pokémon currently active on the field by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to trigger stat changes on valid targets).
* **Targeting:** All Pokémon (Affects both allies and opponents, provided they are Grass-type).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Niche Support / Doubles Force Multiplier.
* **Usage:** Rototiller is a highly specialized utility move almost exclusively reserved for **Double Battles**. Unlike standard self-buffs, it functions as a "team-wide offensive boost" for Grass-type partners. It is often compared to moves like *Flower Shield*, but focuses on offensive pressure (Mixed Work Up) rather than defense. Because it hits all Pokémon on the field, it requires careful positioning to avoid accidentally buffing an opponent’s Grass-type threat.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage. However, it synergizes with the **Grass** type, which is Super Effective against **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow and thematic distribution (19 total learners), primarily consisting of Pokémon associated with digging, farming, or soil manipulation.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Excadrill**, **Mudsdale**, and **Dugtrio**. 
* **Thematic Synergy:** **Tapu Bulu** is the most notable user that shares the Grass-typing, allowing it to potentially buff itself while setting up Grassy Terrain, though it often prefers direct physical attacks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Diggersby** and **Onix** in niche doubles strategies designed to pivot into and support high-speed Grass-type "Nukes" like Venusaur or Meowscarada.
* **Acquisition:** This move is generally learned through leveling up; it is notably **not** a common TM or TR, making its distribution very restricted.
