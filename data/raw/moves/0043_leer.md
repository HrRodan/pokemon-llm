## Identity & Mechanics
**Leer** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user intimidates the target with a sharp, piercing glare that shakes their resolve. By staring down the opposition, the user find openings in their guard, effectively making them more vulnerable to physical strikes. This psychological tactic is a staple for predatory and aggressive Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target's Defense stat by one stage (-1). In Double Battles, this move targets both opponents simultaneously.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reduce Defense.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Utility / Spread Debuffer.
* **Usage:** While Leer is a fundamental early-game move for many physical attackers, it is rarely seen in high-level Singles due to the preference for more drastic drops (like Screech) or self-buffs (like Swords Dance). However, in **Double Battles (VGC)**, its ability to bypass "Follow Me" (by hitting both slots) and soften two targets at once gives it niche utility for enabling a physical partner. It is strictly superior to *Tail Whip* in flavor, though mechanically identical in effect.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks in some early generations; affects all types including Ghost-types (as it is a status move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (286 learners), making it one of the most common natural moves for predatory and combat-oriented Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on physical powerhouses such as **Charizard**, **Feraligatr**, **Tyranitar**, and **Incineroar**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently found on aggressive Legendaries and Paradox Pokémon like **Galarian Moltres**, **Entei**, and **Roaring Moon** as a natural part of their level-up movepool.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up at early stages; it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, as most Pokémon that would want it learn it naturally before evolving.
