## Identity & Mechanics
**Teleport** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user warps space-time to instantaneously withdraw from the battlefield. While originally used to escape wild encounters, it has evolved into a tactical repositioning tool where the user vanishes and reappears back in its Poké Ball, allowing a teammate to take its place.
* **Effect:** In wild battles, the user immediately flees. In trainer battles (since Generation VIII), the user switches out at the end of the turn. Unlike damaging pivot moves like U-turn or Volt Switch, Teleport has a **-6 priority bracket**, ensuring the user almost always moves last.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Slow Pivot / Momentum Generator.**
* **Usage:** Teleport is a premier utility move for defensive cores. Because of its **-6 priority**, the user typically absorbs an incoming attack before switching out, allowing a fragile offensive "glass cannon" teammate to enter the field safely without taking damage. This "Dry Pass" mechanic is superior to U-turn in many defensive scenarios as it prevents the incoming Pokémon from being hit on the switch. It is frequently compared to **Flip Turn** or **Volt Switch**, but it is valued for its guaranteed "second-half" positioning.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many targeting restrictions; fails if the user is trapped by moves like Mean Look or abilities like Shadow Tag (unless the user is holding a Shed Shell).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (56 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic-types and mystical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with the **Abra line (Alakazam)**, but its most impactful competitive users are bulky walls like **Slowbro**, **Slowking**, and **Clefable**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Blissey** and **Chansey** in Smogon formats to provide safe entry for powerful wallbreakers while maintaining the team's defensive loop.
* **Acquisition:** Originally a common TM in Generation I and Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee; it saw a massive resurgence in Generation VIII via Move Tutors, making it a staple of the "Teleport-Wish" passing meta.
