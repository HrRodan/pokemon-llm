## Identity & Mechanics
**Sacred Fire** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a mystical, blazing pillar of purifying fire that incinerates the target with legendary heat. This move represents the divine power of the phoenix and the intense heat of volcanic energy, making it one of the most prestigious Fire-type attacks in the franchise.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and possesses the unique property of allowing the user to thaw itself out if it is currently **Frozen** when the move is selected.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to **Burn** the target. This exceptionally high activation rate makes it one of the most dangerous status-inflicting attacks in competitive play.
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Value Physical STAB / Status-Inducing Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Sacred Fire is widely considered one of the best moves in the game. Unlike its rival, *Flare Blitz*, it carries no recoil damage, and unlike *Fire Blast*, it utilizes the Physical attack stat. Its 50% burn rate allows users to "fish" for status, effectively neutering physical attackers who attempt to switch in. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Notably, despite being a physical move, Sacred Fire **does not make contact**, allowing the user to bypass effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Strength Sap. Its low PP makes it vulnerable to the **Pressure** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, traditionally serving as a signature move (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by the Legendary Pokémon **Ho-Oh** (its original signature user) and **Entei**, who gained access to the move in later generations to bolster its physical offensive presence.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusivity, it is rarely seen as coverage on other Pokémon; however, for **Entei**, it serves as a mandatory STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move that distinguishes it from other physical Fire-types like Arcanine.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned through leveling up by its specific legendary users or via special events.
