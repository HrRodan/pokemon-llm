## Identity & Mechanics
**Terrain Pulse** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user harnesses the ambient energy of the battlefield to unleash a concentrated blast. While appearing as a standard pulse of energy under normal conditions, the move's elemental properties and destructive potential shift dramatically based on the active Terrain, mimicking the environmental essence of the floor.
* **Effect:** If a Terrain is active and the user is "grounded," the move's power doubles from 50 to **100** and its type changes to match the terrain: 
    * **Electric Terrain:** Becomes Electric-type.
    * **Grassy Terrain:** Becomes Grass-type.
    * **Misty Terrain:** Becomes Fairy-type.
    * **Psychic Terrain:** Becomes Psychic-type.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (100 in Terrain), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Terrain-Dependent Nuke / Adaptive Coverage.
* **Usage:** Terrain Pulse functions similarly to *Weather Ball*, acting as a powerful STAB or coverage option for Pokémon that can set their own Terrain via "Surge" abilities or "Seed Sower." In its boosted state (100 BP), it becomes a high-consistency Special attack that often benefits from the 1.3x damage multiplier of the corresponding terrain (Electric, Grassy, and Psychic). It deals **Super Effective** damage based on its transformed state (e.g., hitting Water-types when in Electric/Grassy Terrain).
* **Attributes:** This is a **Pulse move**, meaning its power is further increased by 50% if the user has the **Mega Launcher** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (28 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with thematic ties to nature, energy manipulation, or "Surge" mechanics.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Indeedee (Male & Female):** Sets Psychic Terrain automatically; Terrain Pulse provides a 100 BP Psychic STAB move that hits harder than Psychic under certain conditions.
    * **Arboliva:** Utilizes the *Seed Sower* ability to set Grassy Terrain, turning Terrain Pulse into a reliable 100 BP Grass STAB.
    * **Clawitzer:** The premier user of this move due to **Mega Launcher**, which boosts the 100 BP (in terrain) by an additional 50%, resulting in a massive 150 BP coverage nuke.
    * **Xerneas:** An iconic Legendary user that can utilize it as Fairy-type coverage in Misty Terrain.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Venusaur** or **Blastoise** in specific VGC (Doubles) compositions where a teammate provides the necessary Terrain to expand their coverage profile.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in the *Sword & Shield* Isle of Armor DLC; it remains available via specialized learning or TM in subsequent appearances.
