## Identity & Mechanics
**Crush Grip** is a physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user seizes the opponent in a crushing, titan-like embrace, exerting massive physical pressure. This move is a variable-power attack where the force of the "grip" is directly tied to the target's vitality; the more HP and energy the opponent has, the more devastating the crushing force becomes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the target's current HP percentage. The base power is calculated using the formula: `1 + 120 × (Current HP / Max HP)`. At full health, the move reaches its maximum potential of **121 Base Power**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable (1–121)], Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Power Lead Punisher / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Crush Grip serves as a signature high-damage option for opening a confrontation. While it rivals the power of **Return** or **Double-Edge** when the opponent is at high health, its utility drops off sharply as the target's HP is depleted, making it poor for finishing off weakened foes. It is the physical counterpart to the move **Wring Out**. As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of a single Legendary Pokémon (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Regigigas**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move with no TM/TR availability, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. For Regigigas, it is often used alongside moves like *Body Slam* or *Return* to ensure consistent damage once the target's HP has been lowered by an initial Crush Grip.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via level-up for Regigigas; it has never been made available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor teaching in any generation.
