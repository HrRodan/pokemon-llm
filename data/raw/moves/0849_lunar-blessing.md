## Identity & Mechanics
**Lunar Blessing** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user invokes the soothing power of the moon to bathe the battlefield in celestial light. This moonlight purifies the user and its allies, mending wounds and clearing mental or physical afflictions. In its original appearance, it also shrouded the user in a protective mist to hinder enemy accuracy.
* **Effect:** Restores 25% of the user's and its allies' maximum HP and cures all non-volatile status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, Poison, Freeze). In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it also applied the "obscured" status, increasing the user's evasion.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to cure status conditions upon use.
* **Targeting:** User and all active allies (Spread/Support).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy), PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Utility / Cleric / Sustain.
* **Usage:** Lunar Blessing is a high-value **Sustain** tool that compresses two vital roles—healing and status clearing—into a single turn. While it restores less HP than *Recover* (which heals 50%), its ability to target allies in Doubles and VGC formats makes it a premier **Support** move. It is often compared to *Jungle Healing*, though it benefits from Cresselia's immense natural bulk. It is particularly effective for removing crippling status like Toxic or Sleep from a teammate without requiring a turn for *Heal Bell*.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses protection if targeting allies; blocked by *Taunt*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), serving as a Signature Move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Cresselia**. The move perfectly complements Cresselia's role as one of the premier "bulky supports" in the competitive circuit.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move for a pure Psychic-type, it is not used for coverage but rather to enhance Cresselia's longevity against **Dark**, **Ghost**, and **Bug** type attackers that would otherwise chip it down.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned by Cresselia through leveling up (starting in Generation VIII).
