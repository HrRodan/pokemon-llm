## Identity & Mechanics
**Shell Smash** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user deliberately shatters its protective shell or outer casing in a high-risk maneuver. By sacrificing its physical and special durability, the Pokémon sheds weight and restriction, resulting in an explosive increase in kinetic energy and offensive output. This "Glass Cannon" transformation is a premier setup tactic for turning defensive tanks into unstoppable sweepers.
* **Effect:** Simultaneously raises the user’s **Attack, Special Attack, and Speed by two stages (+2 each)** while lowering the user’s **Defense and Special Defense by one stage (-1 each)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —- %, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Hyper-Offensive Setup / Win-Condition.
* **Usage:** Widely considered one of the most powerful setup moves in Pokémon history. Because it provides a +2 boost to both offensive stats and Speed in a single turn, it effectively doubles the user's damage potential and outspeeding capability. It is almost exclusively paired with the **White Herb** held item, which immediately consumes itself to restore the lowered Defense and Special Defense stats, allowing the user to sweep without the drawback of fragility.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Status** move and is therefore susceptible to **Taunt**. It does not make contact and is not affected by protection moves like Protect (as it targets the user).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate and thematic distribution (40 learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with shells, carapaces, or hard exteriors.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Cloyster:** The most iconic user; combines Shell Smash with the *Skill Link* ability to fire off 100% accurate, multi-hit moves like Icicle Spear and Rock Blast at +2 Attack.
    * **Blastoise:** Gains immense utility in higher tiers by using Shell Smash to become a versatile mixed sweeper.
    * **Polteageist:** A rare non-shell user (using its teapot as a shell); utilizes Shell Smash alongside its *Weak Armor* ability to reach astronomical Speed tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** While the move is Normal-type, it is used by **Water, Rock, and Ghost types** to bypass their natural low speed. It allows Pokémon like **Omastar** or **Carracosta** to overcome their "Slow Tank" archetype and become "Wallbreakers."
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via **Level Up**. It is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its distribution very exclusive to specific evolutionary lines.
