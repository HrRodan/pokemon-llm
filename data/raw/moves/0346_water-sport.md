## Identity & Mechanics
**Water Sport** is a Status Water-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user splashes water across itself and the surrounding area, thoroughly soaking the battlefield. This creates a damp environment that douses flames, significantly weakening the impact of heat-based attacks and providing a defensive buffer against thermal energy.
* **Effect:** While this move is active, the power of Fire-type moves is reduced by 50% (a 0.5× multiplier) for all Pokémon on the field. The effect remains active as long as the user stays in battle; if the user switches out, the effect immediately ends.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (Affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Anti-Meta Tech.
* **Usage:** Water Sport is a niche defensive option used to mitigate Fire-type weaknesses. In competitive play, it is almost entirely outclassed by **Rain Dance**, which also reduces Fire-type damage by 50% but provides the additional benefits of boosting Water-type STAB moves and activating weather-based abilities like Swift Swim. Its primary value is in low-level play or specific themed strategies where weather manipulation is undesirable. It is effective for dampening the damage of **Fire**-type threats.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses accuracy checks as a field-status effect.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (52 learners), primarily found among Water-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by the Legendary **Latias**, and high-stat Water types like **Milotic**, **Pelipper**, and the starter **Samurott**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Budew** (and its evolution Roserade) or **Masquerain** to tech against their glaring 4x or 2x Fire-type weaknesses, allowing them to survive a hit they otherwise could not.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via Level-up or as an Egg Move; it has historically lacked TM/TR status, making its availability dependent on a Pokémon's natural movepool.
