## Identity & Mechanics
**Heal Block** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** The user emits a restrictive psychic field or aura that inhibits the opponent's ability to regenerate health. This tactical disruption prevents the target from utilizing restorative energy, cellular repair, or healing items, effectively forcing them to rely on their current HP pool.
* **Effect:** For five turns, the target is prohibited from using HP-recovery moves (such as Recover, Roost, or Soft-Boiled). Furthermore, healing effects from items (like Leftovers) and abilities (like Regeneration or Rain Dish) are suppressed. Draining moves (like Giga Drain or Drain Punch) will still inflict damage but will fail to restore any HP to the user.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the Heal Block status).
* **Targeting:** All-Opponents (In Double Battles, this affects both foes simultaneously).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Anti-Stall Utility** / **Disruptor**.
* **Usage:** Heal Block is a niche "tech" move specifically designed to break **Stall archetypes**. It is most effective against "Pink Blobs" or defensive walls that rely on reliable recovery to outlast the opponent. While often overshadowed by **Taunt** (which blocks all status moves), Heal Block has the unique advantage of specifically disabling passive recovery from items like Leftovers and lasting for a fixed duration even if the user switches out. In VGC (Doubles), its ability to hit both opponents makes it a powerful tool for focused fire strategies.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it ignores Psychic-type effectiveness, though it cannot affect Pokémon behind a **Substitute** or those with the **Good as Gold** ability.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypassed by Magic Bounce.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution (28 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic-types and Mythical/Legendary Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently associated with high-tier Legendaries like **Dialga**, **Palkia**, and **Latios**, as well as defensive Psychic-types like **Bronzong** and **Reuniclus**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Gothitelle**; when paired with the **Shadow Tag** ability, Gothitelle can trap a defensive wall and use Heal Block to ensure the target cannot recover while being slowly chipped away. It is also a notable niche option on **Shedinja** and **Klefki** for disruption.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is limited to Level-up lists for specific species; it is notably **absent as a TM/TR** in recent generations, making it a rare and technical utility choice.
