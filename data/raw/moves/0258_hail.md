## Identity & Mechanics
**Hail** is a Status Ice-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user summons a localized, freezing vortex that blankets the entire battlefield in a relentless hailstorm. This icy tempest persists for five turns, buffeting the arena with jagged ice crystals that disrupt focus and wear down the endurance of any Pokémon not adapted to sub-zero temperatures.
* **Effect:** Changes the weather to Hail for five turns (extended to eight turns if the user holds an **Icy Rock**). While active, all non-Ice-type Pokémon take 1/16 of their maximum HP in damage at the end of each turn. Additionally, it grants the move **Blizzard** 100% accuracy and allows it a 25% chance to bypass *Protect* or *Detect*.
* **Secondary Effect:** Reduces the healing of *Morning Sun*, *Synthesis*, and *Moonlight* to 25% of the user's max HP. Pokémon with the **Snow Cloak** ability gain increased evasion and immunity to Hail damage, while those with **Ice Body** recover HP.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Weather Setter / Utility.
* **Usage:** Hail is the foundation of dedicated "Hail Teams." While historically considered niche compared to Rain or Sand, it serves as a powerful **disruptor** by breaking **Focus Sashes** and **Sturdy** abilities through constant chip damage. Its primary offensive synergy is enabling "Blizzard Spam," turning a high-risk nuke into a reliable STAB option. It also functions as a hard counter to Sun-based teams by neutering their recovery moves.
* **Type Matchups:** It provides passive chip damage against all types except **Ice**.
* **Attributes:** Weather-inducing; persists upon switching out.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (202 learners), primarily found among Water and Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most commonly associated with **Abomasnow**, **Vanilluxe**, and **Alolan Ninetales**, all of whom often prefer the ability "Snow Warning" to set this weather automatically, but can manual-set if necessary. **Lapras** and **Walrein** are also iconic thematic users.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on high-tier threats like **Mewtwo**, **Dragonite**, or **Kyogre** in specific formats to overwrite opposing weather (like Primal Groudon's Desolate Land) or to guarantee accuracy for Blizzard coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible, appearing as a **TM** (TM07 in many generations) or **TR** in almost every game since its debut.
