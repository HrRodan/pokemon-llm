## Identity & Mechanics
**Bide** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user enters a state of focused endurance, stoically absorbing incoming kinetic energy and elemental assaults for two consecutive turns. On the final turn, the user erupts, unleashing a concentrated blast of stored energy that deals typeless damage equal to twice the amount received during the waiting period. It is the ultimate "high-risk, high-reward" retaliatory maneuver.
* **Effect:** The user "charges" for two turns. On the second turn after selection, it deals fixed damage to the last opponent that struck it. This damage ignores type effectiveness and cannot be a critical hit. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it cannot be selected by **Sleep Talk**.
* **Targeting:** Affects the last Pokémon to hit the user; the move itself targets the **User** to initiate the state.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Gimmick Punisher / Fixed-Damage Retaliator.
* **Usage:** Bide is generally considered non-viable in high-level competitive play due to its extreme predictability. An opponent can simply use the "waiting" turns to set up **Entry Hazards**, use **Substitute**, or switch to a Pokémon with **Protect**. It is outclassed by more immediate retaliatory moves like **Counter** (for Physical moves) or **Mirror Coat** (for Special moves), which provide instant results rather than telegraphing the attack for multiple turns.
* **Type Matchups:** As it deals **Typeless** damage, it ignores the standard type chart. It can hit **Ghost-types** and ignores the resistances of **Rock** and **Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move has **+1 Priority** on the turn it is first used, ensuring the user begins "biding" before most opponents can move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (213 learners), primarily due to its status as an iconic TM in early generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Squirtle**, **Charmander**, and **Bulbasaur** lines in early Kanto journeys. It is frequently seen on high-HP or high-defense Pokémon like **Snorlax**, **Chansey**, and **Shuckle**, who attempt to leverage their bulk to survive the accumulation phase.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often found on early-route Pokémon like **Raticate** or **Gumshoos** to provide a way to deal heavy damage to evolved threats before the player has access to high-base-power moves.
* **Acquisition:** Historically significant as **TM04** in Generation I (Blue/Red/Yellow). Its availability has significantly diminished in recent generations, often being restricted to a Pokémon's natural level-up pool.
