## Identity & Mechanics
**Water Pulse** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user attacks the target with a series of ultrasonic, pulsating waves of water. The vibration and pressure of these waves are designed to disorient the opponent, often leaving them in a state of mental fog. As a "Pulse" move, it interacts specifically with abilities that enhance wave-based attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and possesses a chance to disorient the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** **20%** chance to **Confuse** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Early-game Reliable STAB / Specialized Niche Attacker.
* **Usage:** In standard play, Water Pulse is generally outclassed by **Scald** (for its Burn chance) or **Surf** (for higher raw damage). However, it occupies a unique niche due to the ability **Mega Launcher**, which increases the power of Pulse moves by 50%, effectively turning Water Pulse into a 90-power move with a confusion chance. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Pulse Move (Boosted by Mega Launcher; can hit non-adjacent targets in Triple Battles). It is *not* a sound-based move despite the flavor text.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (**333 learners**), making it one of the most accessible Water-type TMs in history.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Clawitzer** and **Mega Blastoise**, both of whom utilize the *Mega Launcher* ability to maximize its damage. It is also a staple early-game move for **Squirtle**, **Mudkip**, and **Piplup**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon with diverse movepools, such as **Lucario**, **Nidoking**, and **Latios/Latios**, to provide reliable Special Water-type coverage against Fire and Ground threats.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (notably TM03 in Gen 3/4 and TM011 in Gen 9), ensuring it is available to almost any Pokémon capable of manipulating water or sonic energy.
