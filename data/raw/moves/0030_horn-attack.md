## Identity & Mechanics
**Horn Attack** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lunges at the target to deliver a sharp, piercing strike using a single or multiple protruding horns. This physical jab relies on the user's anatomical weaponry to deal direct damage through momentum and focal point pressure.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-Game Progression Move / Reliable Filler.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Horn Attack is almost entirely outclassed by higher-power Normal-type moves such as **Body Slam** (for utility/paralysis) or **Return/Double-Edge** (for raw damage). Its primary value exists in the early leveling stages of a playthrough due to its perfect accuracy and decent PP. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **No** types, as it is a Normal-type move.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow and specific distribution (21 learners), limited primarily to Pokémon featuring prominent horn structures.
* **Prominent Users:** Traditionally associated with the **Nidoking** and **Rhydon** evolutionary lines. It is also a signature-style move for **Tauros** and the Bug/Fighting-type **Heracross**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for coverage due to its Normal typing, it appears in the movepools of powerful Paradox Pokémon like **Great Tusk** and **Iron Treads**, as well as the Legendary **Tapu Bulu**, though these Pokémon almost always prefer their specialized STAB options.
* **Acquisition:** This move is notably **not available via TM or TR**; it is learned exclusively through leveling up or as an Egg Move by specific species.
