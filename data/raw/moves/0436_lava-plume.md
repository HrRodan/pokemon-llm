## Identity & Mechanics
**Lava Plume** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user triggers a volcanic eruption, releasing a massive inferno of scarlet flames and molten debris that washes over the entire battlefield. This searing wave of heat is designed to incinerate everything in its path, carrying a high heat intensity that frequently leaves targets with lingering burns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a high **30% chance** to inflict a **Burn** on the target(s).
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (Hits all other Pokémon in Double Battles, including allies).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Defensive Utility / Reliable STAB**.
* **Usage:** Lava Plume is often favored over *Flamethrower* (90 BP) or *Fire Blast* (110 BP) on defensive or bulky Fire-types. Its defining trait is the **30% burn chance**, making it the Fire-type equivalent of *Scald*. This allows the user to punish physical attackers and "fish" for status drops that halve the opponent's Attack stat. In Doubles, it acts as a powerful spread move, though it requires a partner with *Flash Fire* or *Protect* to avoid friendly fire. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Steel, Grass, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is a spread move in multi-battle formats.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow and thematic distribution (23 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon associated with volcanoes, magma, or intense internal heat.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Heatran**, **Torkoal**, and **Entei**, who all use the move to fish for burns while maintaining consistent damage. **Typhlosion** (and its Hisuian form) also utilizes it as a reliable STAB option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Primal Groudon** or **Camerupt** to provide spread pressure and utility in VGC or restricted formats.
* **Acquisition:** Lava Plume is rarely a TM/TR move; it is typically learned through **leveling up** by Pokémon with volcanic origins.
