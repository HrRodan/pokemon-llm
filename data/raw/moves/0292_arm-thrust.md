## Identity & Mechanics
**Arm Thrust** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** The user delivers a rapid-fire sequence of straight-arm, open-palm thrusts or sumo-style "harite" strikes against the target. This relentless flurry of blows strikes the opponent multiple times in quick succession, overwhelming their defenses through sheer volume of impact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage 2 to 5 times in a single turn. The move has a 37.5% (3/8) chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% (1/8) chance to hit 4 or 5 times. Each hit calculates damage, critical hits, and contact-based effects (like Rocky Helmet) independently.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though it effectively bypasses protection mechanics that rely on a single hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15 (Per hit), Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Multi-hit Utility / Shield Breaker.
* **Usage:** While its total base power is relatively low (averaging 45 and peaking at 75), Arm Thrust serves as a specialized **Check** against strategies involving **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, **Multiscale**, or **Substitutes**. Because each strike is calculated separately, the first hit can break a Substitute or a Focus Sash, allowing subsequent hits to deal direct damage. It is generally outclassed in raw damage by reliable STAB options like *Close Combat* or *Drain Punch*, but it finds niche use on Pokémon with the **Skill Link** ability (if available) or as a flavor-accurate thematic choice for Sumo-inspired builds.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning the user is susceptible to *Iron Barbs*, *Rough Skin*, and *Rocky Helmet* damage for every successful hit landed.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (11 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with bulky, humanoid, or martial arts-themed designs.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic on the **Makuhita/Hariyama** line and its futuristic Paradox relative **Iron Hands**. It is also a signature part of the leveling moveset for the **Tepig/Emboar** and **Pawmi/Pawmot** evolutionary lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Heracross** or **Pangoro**, though these Pokémon typically prefer higher-impact Fighting-type moves for wallbreaking. 
* **Acquisition:** Arm Thrust is a "Natural" move typically learned via Level Up; it has never been available as a **TM or TR**, making its distribution strictly tied to a Pokémon's innate movepool.
