## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Ascent** is a physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation VI (Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).
* **Description:** The user soars high into the atmosphere, surpassing the clouds, before plummeting toward the target like a high-velocity meteor. This devastating kinetic strike generates immense friction and impact force, though the exertion leaves the user’s defensive posture compromised. Despite its name, it is a Flying-type move, representing the zenith of aerial mastery.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage to a single target and subsequently lowers the user’s **Defense** and **Special Defense** by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger self-inflicted stat drops.
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Dragon Ascent is the Flying-type equivalent of *Close Combat*. It is widely considered one of the best moves in the game due to its perfect accuracy and high base power. It allows the user to OHKO or 2HKO most neutral targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.
* **Signature Mechanic:** In its debut games, Dragon Ascent is the mechanical trigger for **Mega Evolution**. Unlike other Pokémon, Rayquaza does not require a Mega Stone; it simply needs to know this move to undergo Mega Evolution in battle, allowing it to hold a different item (like a Life Orb or Choice Band), making it one of the most powerful entities in competitive history.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (2 learners), functioning as a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Rayquaza** and its **Mega Evolution**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to a Legendary Pokémon, it is not used for coverage by other types. However, on Rayquaza, it provides essential STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) that complements its access to moves like *Extreme Speed*, *V-create*, and *Earthquake*.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be learned via TM or level-up in the traditional sense; it is typically taught by a **Move Tutor** (such as Zinnia’s grandmother in ORAS) or via specific plot events in later generations (like the move reminder in the Crown Tundra).
