## Identity & Mechanics
**Psyshield Bash** is a physical Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII, specifically debutting in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*.
* **Description:** The user materializes a dense barrier of telekinetic force around its body before charging headlong into the opponent. This move combines aggressive physical momentum with protective psychic energy, shimmering with ethereal light as the user impacts the target.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the user's Defense stat by one stage. In its debut generation, it raised both defensive stats, but in standard competitive play (Gen IX), it focuses on bolstering physical Defense.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the user's Defense by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected-pokemon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility-Attacker / Defensive Setup.
* **Usage:** While its Base Power is modest, Psyshield Bash functions as a "buffing attack." It is used to transform the user into a physical tank while maintaining offensive pressure. It is often compared to moves like *Power-Up Punch* or *Flame Charge*, though it sacrifices a small amount of accuracy for a significant defensive pay-off. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), serving as a signature-style move for a specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Wyrdeer** (as its signature move required for evolution) and its pre-evolution **Stantler**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Psychic Pokémon have access to this move, as it is tied specifically to the physiology of the Stantler line.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via **TM/TR**; it can only be learned via level-up, making it a rare and specialized tool in the current meta.
