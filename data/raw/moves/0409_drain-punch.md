## Identity & Mechanics
**Drain Punch** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user focuses its fighting spirit into a concentrated fist, delivering a powerful blow that siphons the target's life-force. This vampiric strike allows the user to revitalize itself, converting the kinetic energy of the impact into physical recovery. It is a vital tool for "Drain Tank" strategies and martial-arts-themed Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. The user recovers 50% of the damage dealt as HP. If the target has the Liquid Ooze ability, the user takes damage instead of healing.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The healing is a primary mechanical effect). 
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Sustain / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Drain Punch is the gold standard for longevity in physical attackers. While it lacks the raw "nuke" potential of **Close Combat** (120 Power), it offsets this by providing health regeneration, allowing bulky attackers to stay on the field longer. It is particularly effective on Pokémon with high HP or those using **Assault Vest**, as the recovery scales with damage dealt. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Rock, Steel, Ice,** and **Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and a **Punching** move; it receives a 20% power boost from the **Iron Fist** ability.

It has a very wide distribution (177 learners), making it one of the most accessible Fighting-type coverage moves in the game.

    * **Iron Hands:** A premier user in VGC/Raids, utilizing its massive HP pool to "Drain Tank" opponents.
    * **Annihilape:** Uses it to maintain health while stacking power for its signature *Rage Fist*.
    * **Lucario:** Often carries it for a more consistent, drawback-free Fighting STAB compared to High Jump Kick.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Mewtwo**, **Grimmsnarl**, and **Rillaboom** to punish Steel and Dark-type switch-ins while maintaining HP.
