## Identity & Mechanics
**Hydro Cannon** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user blasts the target with a massive, high-pressure torrent of water. This move represents the absolute pinnacle of Water-type offensive power, generating a deluge so intense that it momentarily drains the user's energy, requiring a period of recovery.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. After using this move, the user must spend the next turn "recharging," during which it cannot attack, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Recharge mechanic is a mandatory drawback).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Last-Resort Finisher.
* **Usage:** While boasting incredible raw power, Hydro Cannon is rarely used in standard competitive play because the "recharge" turn allows opponents a free switch-in or a "setup" turn (e.g., using Swords Dance or Dragon Dance). It is strictly inferior to **Hydro Pump** for sustained damage or **Surf** for consistency. It is most effectively used in Z-Moves (as a base for Hydro Vortex) or Dynamax (as Max Geyser) to bypass the recharge turn, or as a desperate "final blow" when the user is about to faint. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. Affected by King's Rock.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (15 total learners), restricted almost exclusively to Water-type Starter Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the final evolutions of Water starters, most notably **Blastoise**, **Greninja** (especially Battle Bond/Ash-Greninja), and **Swampert**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Generally not used for coverage; its distribution is so limited that it is almost always used as a high-powered **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) option rather than a coverage tool. **Mew** is the only non-starter capable of learning it.
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught only by specialized **Move Tutors** to Starters with maximum friendship; however, it has become available via **TM** in recent titles like *Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk*.
