## Identity & Mechanics
**Continental Crush (Special)** is a Special Rock-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user gathers an immense amount of Z-Power to manifest a colossal, mountain-sized boulder from the earth, which is then dropped onto the target with tectonic force. This move represents the ultimate expression of Rock-type energy, designed to overwhelm the opponent through sheer mass and gravitational impact.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move triggered by a Pokémon holding **Rockium Z** while knowing a base Special Rock-type move (such as Power Gem or Ancient Power). It inflicts massive damage and bypasses accuracy checks.
* **Secondary Effect:** Like most offensive Z-Moves, it ignores protection moves (dealing 25% damage through Protect) and cannot miss.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200 based on base move], Accuracy --%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaking Nuke / Lure.** 
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats (SM/USUM) to secure a one-time knockout on a defensive threat that might otherwise survive a standard hit. Since Special Rock-type moves are rarer than physical ones, the Special version of Continental Crush is often used as a **Lure** to catch physically defensive walls (like Skarmory or Great Tusk precursors) off-guard. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move; bypasses Accuracy/Evasion modifiers; requires a Z-Crystal.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Access to this specific Special variant is restricted to Pokémon capable of learning Special Rock-type moves, which is a **Narrow** pool compared to physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Nihilego:** Utilizing its high Special Attack and *Power Gem* as a base, Nihilego uses this to delete checks like Celesteela or Mega Charizard Y.
    * **Diancie / Mega Diancie:** Often runs a Special or mixed set; Continental Crush provides a massive burst of damage that *Power Gem* lacks.
    * **Omastar:** A Shell Smash sweeper that can use this move to punch through specially defensive cores after a boost.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Starmie** or **Aurorus** in specific meta-games to provide a high-power Rock-type nuke that benefits from their Special Attack investment.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible in Generation VII via the **Rockium Z** crystal; it is not available as a standard TM or move in later generations.
