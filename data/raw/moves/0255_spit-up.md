## Identity & Mechanics
**Spit Up** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user forcefully expels energy that has been accumulated within its body through the move Stockpile. The visual execution often involves the Pokémon growing physically larger or glowing with stored power before releasing a devastating projectile or blast of raw energy at the target. This move is the offensive component of the "Stockpile trio" (Stockpile, Swallow, and Spit Up).
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the number of stages of Stockpile the user has accumulated. The base power scales linearly: 100 Power for 1 stack, 200 Power for 2 stacks, and a massive 300 Power for 3 stacks. Upon use, the energy is consumed, and any defensive boosts (Defense and Special Defense) gained via Stockpile are reset to zero. The move fails if the user has not used Stockpile.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it uniquely ignores the random damage fluctuation factor, dealing consistent damage based on the formula.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [100 / 200 / 300], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Conditional Gimmick Nuke / Set-up Payoff.
* **Usage:** Spit Up is rarely seen in high-level competitive play due to its heavy "turn investment." It requires at least one turn of Stockpile to function, making it predictable. However, at 3 stacks, its **300 Base Power** makes it one of the strongest moves in the game, functioning as a high-risk wallbreaker. It is often compared to **Hyper Beam**, which has a lower maximum power (150) but does not require setup turns. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **None** (as it is Normal-type), but hits most types neutrally.
* **Attributes:** This is a Special move that does not make contact. It is blocked by Ghost-types and resisted by Rock and Steel-types.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with thematic "stomach" or "storage" motifs.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Pelipper**, **Drifblim**, and **Snorlax** (via egg moves/special distribution). Pokémon like **Swalot** and **Cradily** are the most iconic users, as their defensive stats allow them to survive the turns needed to reach 3 Stockpile stacks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Toxapex** (Mareanie) or **Gastrodon** (Shellos) in lower-tier or casual play as a surprising offensive option on otherwise passive defensive walls.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through natural leveling and Egg Moves. It is notably absent from most TM/TR lists across generations, making it a "signature" mechanic for specific evolutionary lines.
