## Identity & Mechanics
**Blood Moon** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask).
* **Description:** The user focuses the entirety of its spiritual essence, channeling the eerie power of a crimson-red lunar event to unleash a devastating blast of energy. This move captures the primal, supernatural force of the moon, manifesting as a high-intensity orbital strike or energy beam that overwhelms the target.
* **Effect:** The user cannot use Blood Moon consecutively. However, unlike "recharge" moves (e.g., Hyper Beam), the user is free to use a different move or switch out on the following turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Power Special Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Blood Moon is arguably one of the most powerful Special attacks in the game due to its perfect accuracy and lack of a recharge penalty. Its usage is defined by its "cooldown" mechanic, forcing the user to alternate between Blood Moon and other coverage or utility moves (like Earth Power or Calm Mind). Because its primary user possesses the ability **Mind's Eye**, this move ignores the typical Normal-type immunity of Ghost-types, allowing it to hit the entire metagame for at least neutral damage (excluding Steel and Rock types). 
* **Type Matchups:** It deals neutral damage to most types. While Normal moves are not **Super Effective** against any type, the sheer raw power of 140 BP backed by STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) allows it to "muscle through" neutral targets.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special energy-based attack. It is not blocked by Bulletproof but is subject to the mechanics of Protect and its variants.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a unique signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon Form)**. The move is central to this Pokémon's identity, functioning as its primary win condition and wall-breaking tool.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move is restricted to a single Pokémon, it is not used for coverage on other sets; however, on Bloodmoon Ursaluna, it is paired with **Earth Power** to create a near-perfect offensive combination that is notoriously difficult to switch into.
* **Acquisition:** This move is learned via leveling up and is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other Pokémon.
