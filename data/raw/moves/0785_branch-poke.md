## Identity & Mechanics
**Branch Poke** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user brandishes a sharpened, pointed stick or wooden appendage to jab at the target. This move represents a basic, low-impact physical strike common among arboreal Pokémon, utilizing nature-based weaponry for early-game skirmishes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% effect chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Early-Game STAB / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** Branch Poke serves as the fundamental Physical Grass STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for specific starter and wild Pokémon. While reliable due to its perfect accuracy and high PP, it is strictly outclassed in competitive play by higher-yield moves like **Drum Beating**, **Horn Leech**, or **Wood Hammer**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution, specifically limited to two evolutionary lines (5 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature early-game move for the Galar starter **Grookey** (and its evolutions **Thwackey** and **Rillaboom**). It is also naturally learned by the spectral forest-dwellers **Phantump** and **Trevenant**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is almost never seen as a coverage option on non-Grass types. It is used primarily by STAB users during the initial stages of a playthrough.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via **TM, TR, or HM**; it is exclusively learned through leveling up.
