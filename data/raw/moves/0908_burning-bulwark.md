## Identity & Mechanics
**Burning Bulwark** is a status Fire-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user generates a defensive barrier of searing heat, often utilizing intensely hot fur or primordial energy to shield itself. This barrier provides total protection from incoming moves for the turn, acting as a fiery shield that punishes any opponent bold enough to strike from close range.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all effects of moves that target them during that turn. If a move that makes **direct contact** is used against the user while Burning Bulwark is active, the attacker is immediately afflicted with the **Burn** status condition. Like other protection moves, its success rate drops if used consecutively. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **Burn** opponents making contact.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user (Priority +4).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Protective Shield / Defensive Utility.**
* **Usage:** Burning Bulwark is a premier defensive tool, functioning as a superior version of *Protect*. It is most comparable to *Baneful Bunker* (Poison) or *Spiky Shield* (Damage), but arguably more impactful because the resulting **Burn** halves the opponent's Attack stat. This makes it a hard "Check" to physical wallbreakers and contact-heavy sweepers. While it does not deal direct damage, it provides vital **Fire-type utility** by spreading status.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Protection** move. It fails if used after *Protect*, *Detect*, *Endure*, or similar moves. It does not protect against certain "Shield-Breaking" moves like *Urshifu's Surging Strikes* or moves with the *Infiltrator* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, currently serving as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Paradox Pokémon **Gouging Fire**. On this Pokémon, it serves as a cornerstone of its defensive and setup sets, allowing it to scout moves while potentially crippling physical attackers like *Zacian-Crowned* or *Urshifu-Rapid-Strike*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can access this move via TM, TR, or Breeding. Its presence on a team is a guaranteed indicator of **Gouging Fire's** presence.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; learned via leveling up.
