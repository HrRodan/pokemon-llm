## Identity & Mechanics
**U-turn** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A high-speed tactical maneuver where the user strikes the target and immediately retreats to its Poké Ball, allowing a teammate to take its place. This rapid transition is designed to maintain offensive pressure and "Momentum," ensuring the user can escape unfavorable matchups while dealing chip damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage, then the user immediately switches out of battle. The trainer then selects a replacement Pokémon. If the target faints from the attack, the trainer still selects the replacement before the opponent sends out their next Pokémon. It allows a user to escape the effects of **Ingrain** and bypasses most trapping mechanics.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Guaranteed switch upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Pivot / Scouting Move.** It is arguably the most important utility move in competitive Pokémon history.
* **Usage:** Used to maintain **Momentum**. Unlike its counterpart *Volt Switch*, U-turn has no type immunities (as no Pokémon is immune to Bug), making it a more reliable pivoting tool. It is often used by "Slow Pivots" to take a hit and bring in a fragile glass cannon safely, or by "Fast Pivots" to scout an opponent's switch-in. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning the user is susceptible to *Rocky Helmet* damage, *Iron Barbs*, or *Rough Skin*, which can be risky for low-HP scouts.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally **Wide** distribution (273 learners), making it a staple across many team archetypes.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Scizor:** Its most iconic user; often boosted by the *Technician* ability or used to pivot out of Fire-type threats.
    * **Landorus-Therian:** Uses U-turn to cycle its *Intimidate* ability and scout the opponent's lead.
    * **Corviknight:** Utilizes a "Slow U-turn" to safely bring in offensive threats after taking a hit.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Bug Pokémon like **Greninja**, **Cinderace**, and **Dragapult** to provide coverage against Dark and Psychic types while escaping trapping abilities like *Arena Trap* or *Shadow Tag*.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has been a **TM or TR** in every generation since its debut.
