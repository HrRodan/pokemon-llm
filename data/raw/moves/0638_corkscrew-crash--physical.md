## Identity & Mechanics
**Corkscrew Crash (Physical)** is a Physical Steel-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** Acting as the ultimate manifestation of Steel-type energy, the user harnesses its Z-Power to spin its body at high speeds like a drill, ramming into the target with overwhelming centrifugal force. This move transforms a base physical Steel-type move into a singular, high-impact kinetic strike.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be activated if the user is holding a **Steelium Z** and knows a physical Steel-type move. Its base power scales based on the power of the original move (e.g., Iron Head becomes a 160 BP Corkscrew Crash). 
* **Secondary Effect:** Like most Z-Moves, it **bypasses accuracy checks**, meaning it cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig). It also penetrates protection moves (Protect, Detect), dealing 25% of its total damage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1 (Z-Move limit).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / High-Risk Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats to secure a one-time OHKO on defensive threats. It is the premier tool for Physical attackers to bypass the "accuracy bug" of moves like Iron Tail or to push through the Natural Cure or Unaware walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is considered a **Contact** move if the base move was a contact move. It is the Z-Move version of moves like *Iron Head, Meteor Mash, Bullet Punch,* or *Smart Strike*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
While no Pokémon learns this move directly via leveling up, it has a **Universal Distribution** among Pokémon capable of using physical Steel-type attacks.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Kartana:** Uses a 160 BP Corkscrew Crash (from Smart Strike) to shred through neutral targets after a Beast Boost.
    * **Metagross:** Often utilized this in SM/USM to delete Fairy-type checks or bulky neutral threats.
    * **Excadrill:** Can turn Iron Head into a massive nuke to bypass typical checks like Tangrowth or Landorus-T.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Steel Pokémon like **Garchomp** or **Landorus-Therian** (using Iron Tail as a base) specifically to lure and eliminate **Tapu Bulu** or **Clefable**.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible in Generation VII via the **Steelium Z** Crystal; Z-Move mechanics were removed in subsequent generations (Gen VIII onwards).
