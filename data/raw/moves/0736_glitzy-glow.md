## Identity & Mechanics
**Glitzy Glow** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically as an exclusive "Partner Move" in *Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!*
* **Description:** The user focuses intense telekinetic energy into a shimmering bombardment that strikes the opponent. Following the impact, the residual psychic energy coalesces into a shimmering, wondrous barrier that protects the user's team from special attacks. This move blends offensive pressure with defensive utility, visualizing a burst of pink and gold light.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and automatically sets up **Light Screen** on the user's side of the field for five turns (eight turns if holding Light Clay, though the item is unavailable in its debut game).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to set the Light Screen effect upon successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility Attacker / Role Compression.
* **Usage:** Glitzy Glow is an incredibly efficient move that provides **Role Compression**, allowing a Pokémon to deal consistent damage while simultaneously providing team-wide damage reduction. Compared to the standard move **Psychic** (Power 90, 100% Acc), Glitzy Glow trades a small amount of power and accuracy for the massive benefit of a free Light Screen. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special-based psychic attack. As a Partner Move, it has a higher power-to-effect ratio than most standard moves in the series.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a signature move designed specifically for the Let's Go mechanics.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the **Partner Eevee** in *Pokémon: Let’s Go, Eevee!*. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is locked to the Starter Eevee, it is not used for coverage on other Pokémon; however, for Eevee, it serves as its primary Special Psychic-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) equivalent, despite Eevee being Normal-type, due to the unique mechanics of the game's "Partner" system.
* **Acquisition:** Taught by the Move Tutor in Celadon City Pokémon Center only to the starter Eevee. It is not available via TM, TR, or Breeding in other generations.
