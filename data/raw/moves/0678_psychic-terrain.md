## Identity & Mechanics
**Psychic Terrain** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user manifests a mysterious, shimmering violet field that permeates the battlefield with psychic energy. This field sharpens the mental focus of grounded Pokémon while creating a temporal distortion that prevents reactive, high-speed maneuvers. It effectively creates a "safe zone" for slower, high-damage attackers by neutralizing the opponent's ability to strike first with reflex-based techniques.
* **Effect:** Changes the battlefield to Psychic Terrain for 5 turns (8 turns if the user holds a **Terrain Extender**). This overrides Grassy, Electric, or Misty Terrain. While active, all Pokémon on the ground are protected from moves with increased priority (e.g., Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, Fake Out, Prankster-boosted moves). 
* **Secondary Effect:** Increases the power of Psychic-type moves used by grounded Pokémon by 1.3× (1.5× in Generation VII). It also enables the move **Expanding Force** to hit both opponents in Doubles and increases its power.
* **Targeting:** Affects the Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Field Setup / Anti-Revenge Killing.
* **Usage:** While often set automatically by the ability **Psychic Surge** (Tapu Lele, Indeedee), the manual move is used on specific "Psychic Spam" archetypes to reset the field against rival Terrain setters like Rillaboom. It is a hard counter to **Priority Spammers** and "Priority-based Revenge Killers." By boosting Psychic-type damage, it turns strong attackers into "Wallbreakers." It provides a massive offensive buff when hitting **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Field Effect; ignores accuracy/evasion modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (84 learners), primarily among Psychic-types and mystical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Alakazam**, **Mewtwo**, and **Gardevoir**, who benefit from the damage boost and protection from Sucker Punch. **Indeedee (Male/Female)** often carries the move to manually reset the terrain if their ability has already triggered.
* **Coverage/Synergy Utility:** Frequently seen on **Armarouge** and **Iron Valiant** in the Scarlet/Violet meta to enable "Expanding Force" sweeps or to protect **Iron Valiant** from priority moves that target its lower defensive stats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
