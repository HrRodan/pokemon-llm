## Identity & Mechanics
**Lunar Dance** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user performs a mystical dance under the influence of the moon, sacrificing its entire life force to bestow a celestial blessing upon its successor. As the user faints, it releases a shimmering aura that completely revitalizes the next Pokémon entering the fray. This move is a high-stakes support tool designed to bring a fallen or exhausted teammate back to peak fighting condition.
* **Effect:** The user faints immediately. The Pokémon that replaces the user has its HP and the PP of all its moves fully restored. Additionally, any major status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, Poison, or Freeze) are completely cured. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% activation of healing upon successful switch).
* **Targeting:** Self-sacrifice (effects the incoming replacement ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Ultimate Support / Momentum Pivot / "Second Life" Enabler.
* **Usage:** Lunar Dance is the superior version of *Healing Wish*, distinguished by its ability to also restore PP. It is used strategically in the mid-to-late game to sacrifice a weakened defensive wall in order to "re-roll" a win condition. For example, a sweeper that has been stalled out or crippled by status can be brought back to 100% health and full PP to attempt a second sweep. While it is a Psychic-type move, it is not blocked by Dark-types as it targets the user/ally.
* **Attributes:** Sacrifice move; bypasses protection if the user successfully faints.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the **signature move of Cresselia**. As a premier defensive wall with massive HP and defensive stats, Cresselia often spends the match absorbing hits and spreading paralysis, only to use Lunar Dance once its health is low to fully restore a powerful offensive teammate.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it has no coverage utility on other Pokémon. It defines Cresselia’s role as the ultimate "clutch" supporter in competitive formats like Smogon OU or VGC.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is exclusively learned by Cresselia via leveling up.
