## Identity & Mechanics
**Hyperspace Fury** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user, typically manifesting in its Unbound form, utilizes dimensional rifts to unleash a relentless barrage of strikes from its many arms. This supernatural assault originates from hyperspace, ensuring the attack never misses its mark and strikes through the target's spiritual or physical barriers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and completely bypasses and removes the effects of protection moves (such as Protect, Detect, King’s Shield, Spiky Shield, Baneful Bunker, and Obstruct) for the remainder of the turn. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user’s **Defense** stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy —% (Bypasses accuracy checks), PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Shield-Breaking Nuke** / **Signature Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Hyperspace Fury is one of the most oppressive offensive moves in the game due to its "anti-meta" properties. Unlike most moves, it doesn't just bypass *Protect*; it destroys the protection entirely, leaving the target vulnerable to teammates' attacks in Double Battles. While its power is high and it cannot miss, its low PP and the guaranteed Defense drop make the user increasingly susceptible to physical revenge killers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite its description involving "many arms," this move is notably **not a contact move**, meaning it does not trigger effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or King's Shield's Attack drop.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Hoopa-Unbound**. 
* **Mechanic Restriction:** While Hoopa-Confined can technically "know" the move, it is incapable of using it in battle; the move can only be executed if Hoopa is in its **Unbound** form. If Hoopa reverts to its Confined form, it cannot use the move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. It serves as Hoopa-Unbound's primary Physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option, outclassing *Knock Off* in raw power and utility against stall-heavy teams.
* **Acquisition:** Learned via Leveling Up (Level 85 or Move Reminder) exclusively by Hoopa.
