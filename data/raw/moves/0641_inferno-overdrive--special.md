## Identity & Mechanics
**Inferno Overdrive (Special)** is a Special Fire-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user focuses its Z-Power into a concentrated orb of intense heat, unleashing a catastrophic explosion of flame upon the target. This move represents the peak of Fire-type offensive energy, often manifesting as a giant fireball or a spiraling pillar of fire that consumes the entire battlefield.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used if the Pokémon holds a **Firium Z** and knows a Special Fire-type move. Its Power is determined by the base move (e.g., using *Fire Blast* results in an 185 BP nuke, while *Eruption* results in a 200 BP nuke).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. Like most Z-Moves, it ignores accuracy checks and bypasses **Protect/Detect**, dealing 25% of its total damage through such barriers.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / High-Power Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Gen 7 competitive formats (SM/USUM) to secure KOs that standard moves cannot. It is a "one-time-use" button designed to blast through defensive checks like Toxapex or Celesteela. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; ignores the effects of *Kings Shield*, *Spiky Shield*, and *Baneful Bunker* regarding secondary contact penalties (as it is non-contact).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution, as any Pokémon capable of learning a Special Fire-type move can utilize it provided they hold the correct Z-Crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard (Mega Charizard Y)** in non-Mega formats, **Volcarona**, and **Heatran** to eliminate traditional switch-ins.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon like **Magearna** (using *Fleur Cannon* sets with *Hidden Power Fire*) or **Mew** to lure in and delete Steel-type threats.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII by obtaining the **Firium Z** crystal, typically awarded after defeating the Trial of Kiawe at Wela Volcano Park.
