## Identity & Mechanics
**Sky Drop** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user executes a predatory strike, seizing the target and soaring high into the atmosphere. While aloft, both the attacker and the victim are suspended in a semi-invulnerable state, effectively removed from the battlefield's immediate interactions. On the second turn, the user hurtles back to earth, slamming the target into the ground with immense force.
* **Effect:** A two-turn move. On the first turn, the user and target are lifted; neither can act. On the second turn, damage is dealt. It fails to deal damage to Flying-type targets (though they are still lifted). This move is blocked by **Gravity** and has a specific weight limit (fails if the target weighs 200.0 kg or more in later generations).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance). However, it functions as a **Crowd Control** mechanic by preventing the target from using its move on the turn it is lifted.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Disruption / Stall.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in **Double Battles (VGC)** to "kidnap" a dangerous opponent, removing their pressure from the field for one turn while the user’s partner focuses on the remaining foe. It is generally outclassed in Single Battles by **Brave Bird** (for power) or **Roost** (for longevity). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It can be bypassed by moves like **Hurricane, Thunder, Gust,** and **Twister**, which deal double damage to the airborne pair. It famously suffered from a game-breaking glitch in Generation V involving Gravity, leading to its temporary ban in competitive play.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (29 learners), primarily restricted to avian Pokémon and specific high-speed threats.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Aerodactyl**, **Tapu Koko**, and **Hawlucha**. In VGC 2017, Tapu Koko frequently ran Sky Drop to disrupt opponents and facilitate "free" turns for its teammates.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Charizard** or **Braviary** in niche support roles to stall out opposing Tailwind or Trick Room turns.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available as a **TM** (TM58 in Gen V and VI, TM76 in Gen VII). It was notably removed from the TM list in Generation VIII, significantly limiting its modern availability.
