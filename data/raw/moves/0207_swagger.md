## Identity & Mechanics
**Swagger** is a status-class Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user taunts the target with an arrogant, overconfident display, inciting rage that boosts the target's physical power while simultaneously inducing a state of disorientation and confusion.
* **Effect:** Raises the target’s Attack stat by two stages (+2) and then inflicts the Confusion status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** If the target's Attack cannot be raised (e.g., it is already at +6, or the target has the ability *Contrary* or *Clear Body*), the confusion effect will fail to activate.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 85%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** High-Risk Utility / Chaos Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Swagger is a polarizing move often used in "Confusion-hax" strategies. While giving an opponent a +2 Attack boost is extremely dangerous, it serves a dual purpose: it forces the opponent to potentially hit themselves for massive damage (as confusion damage scales with the user's Attack stat) and perfectly sets up the move **Foul Play**, which uses the target's Attack stat for damage calculation. 
* **Historical Context:** In Generation VII, the move was nerfed—its accuracy was reduced from 90% to 85%, and the probability of a confused Pokémon hitting itself was reduced from 50% to 33%, significantly lowering Swagger's reliability.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Magic Coat** in some generations but is generally blocked by **Substitute**. It does not check for type immunity, meaning it can hit Ghost-types despite being a Normal-type move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution, being one of the most common moves in the franchise with **969 total learners**.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Klefki**, **Grimmsnarl**, and **Sableye**. These Pokémon often possess the **Prankster** ability, allowing them to use Swagger with increased priority to disrupt an opponent before they can move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on bulky Dark-types like **Umbreon**, **Mandibuzz**, and **Incineroar**. These Pokémon use Swagger to boost the opponent's Attack before punishing them with a STAB-boosted **Foul Play**, effectively turning the opponent's strength against them.
* **Acquisition:** It has been a nearly universal **TM move** (TM34, TM87, etc.) across almost every generation, making it accessible to a vast majority of the Pokédex.
