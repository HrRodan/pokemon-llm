## Identity & Mechanics
**Guardian of Alola** is a Special Fairy-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** Drawing upon the ancient energies of the Alolan islands, the user—a Land Spirit deity—manifests a colossal, headless avatar made of crystalline energy. This titan slams its fist down upon the target, crushing their resolve and vitality with the literal weight of the region’s power. This move is the signature Z-Move of the Tapu guardians.
* **Effect:** This move deals direct damage equal to **75% (3/4)** of the target's current HP. Because it deals fixed percentage damage, it is not influenced by the user's Special Attack or the target's Special Defense stats.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [Sure-hit]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Shield-Breaker.**
* **Usage:** Guardian of Alola is the ultimate "softening" tool. While it cannot achieve a One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) on its own, it is the most powerful HP-reduction move in the game, far exceeding the 50% cut of *Super Fang* or *Nature's Madness*. It is primarily used to put incredibly bulky walls (like Chansey, Toxapex, or Ferrothorn) into immediate KO range for a teammate. It ignores type resistances in terms of damage calculation, though it cannot hit Pokémon immune to Fairy-type moves (unless neutralized).
* **Attributes:** Requires the user to hold **Tapunium Z** and know the move **Nature's Madness**. As a Z-Move, it bypasses traditional accuracy checks and cannot be fully blocked by *Protect*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, exclusive to the four legendary "Land Spirit" Pokémon of Alola.
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized exclusively by **Tapu Koko**, **Tapu Lele**, **Tapu Bulu**, and **Tapu Fini**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** While the move itself is Fairy-type, its function is utility-based rather than coverage-based. It allows the Tapus to bypass their usual checks; for example, **Tapu Fini** can use it to chunk a Grass-type switch-in for 75% of its health, effectively removing it as a counter for the remainder of the match.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible in Generation VII via the Tapunium Z Crystal. It is not available in later generations where the Z-Move mechanic was removed.
