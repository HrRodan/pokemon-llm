## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Hailstorm** is a physical Ice-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This move represents the pinnacle of cryogenic power exerted by a Dynamaxed Pokémon. The user condensed freezing energy into a massive localized blizzard or a barrage of titanic ice shards that crashes into the target, instantly dropping the temperature of the battlefield to sub-zero levels.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and summons **Hail** (or Snow in Gen IX mechanics, though this move is exclusive to Gen VIII) for five turns. This weather deals chip damage to all non-Ice-type Pokémon at the end of each turn and enables specific abilities like Blizzard's 100% accuracy.
* **Secondary Effect:** Bypasses accuracy checks (Always-Hit) and partially penetrates protection moves like Protect or Detect, dealing 25% of its total damage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–150 based on base move], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Field Control / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Max Hailstorm is a dual-purpose tool used to secure KOs while simultaneously setting up the weather. In VGC and BSS (Gen VIII), it was vital for resetting opposing weather (like Torkoal's Sun or Tyranitar's Sand) and breaking **Focus Sashes** through end-of-turn hail damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ground, Flying, and Dragon** types, making it one of the most potent offensive coverage types in the game.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Max Move**; its power is determined by the base Ice-type move known by the Pokémon (e.g., Icicle Crash yields 130 Power). It is not affected by King's Rock or other held item secondary effects but benefits from STAB and weather boosts.

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Max Move, it does not have a standard "learned by" list; instead, it is accessible to **any Pokémon** that knows an Ice-type attacking move while Dynamaxed.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Galarian Darmanitan** (for massive Physical output), **Kyurem-Black** (to utilize its high base attack), and **Glaceon** (to set its own Blizzard accuracy).
* **Coverage Utility:** Often used by non-Ice types like **Gyaraods**, **Tyranitar**, or **Dragonite** via Ice Beam or Ice Punch coverage to surprise and OHKO 4x Ice-weak threats like Landorus-T or Rayquaza.
* **Acquisition:** Available to any Pokémon using an Ice-type move under the Dynamax transformation; does not require a specific TM but relies on the base move's availability (often via **TM27 Icicle Spear** or **TM05 Ice Punch**).
