## Identity & Mechanics
**Fusion Flare** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user manifests an enormous sphere of scorching fire and brings it down upon the target with immense force. Visually characterized by a vibrant, orange-red combustion, it represents the concept of "active" energy. In the lore of the Unova region, it is one of the twin powers of the Tao Trio, designed to resonate with its counterpart, Fusion Bolt.
* **Effect:** Deals standard damage. The move’s power doubles to **200** if a teammate (in Double Battles) or a preceding Pokémon has used **Fusion Bolt** earlier in the same turn. Additionally, if the user is frozen, using Fusion Flare will instantly thaw them.
* **Secondary Effect:** 0% chance to Burn (Unusual for a high-power Fire-type move).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** Fusion Flare serves as the "consistency" option for its users. While moves like *Blue Flare* or *Fire Blast* offer higher raw power, Fusion Flare’s perfect accuracy makes it the preferred choice for players who cannot risk a miss in high-stakes Uber-tier matches. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types. 
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; unaffected by King's Rock (no secondary effect). It is a "pulse" style move thematically but does not receive a Mega Launcher boost.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, restricted to legendary Pokémon (2 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily used by **Reshiram**, for whom it serves as a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, and **Kyurem-White**, which utilizes its massive Special Attack stat to melt Steel-types that would otherwise wall its Ice-type attacks.
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is not found on non-Fire or non-Legendary Pokémon. Its presence on a team is a definitive indicator of the "Tao Trio" members being present.
* **Acquisition:** Exclusive to Level-up or event distributions for the specific Legendaries mentioned; it is **not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor.**
