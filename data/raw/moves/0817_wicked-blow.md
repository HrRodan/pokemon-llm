## Identity & Mechanics
**Wicked Blow** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** The user, having reached the pinnacle of the Single Strike Style, channels overwhelming dark energy into a single, devastating strike. The user lunges at the foe with a concentrated fist of shadows, delivering a blow so precise and powerful that it shatters through the opponent's defenses.
* **Effect:** This move deals damage and **always results in a critical hit** (unless the target has an ability like Battle Armor or Shell Armor). Because it is a guaranteed critical hit, it effectively ignores the user's negative attack modifiers (such as Intimidate) and the target's positive defensive stat changes (such as Iron Defense).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% Critical Hit rate.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Yield Wallbreaker / Guaranteed Nuke.
* **Usage:** While its base power of 75 appears modest, the guaranteed critical hit multiplier (1.5x) grants it an **effective Base Power of 112.5**. Combined with STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), it becomes one of the most terrifyingly consistent physical attacks in the game. It is the premier tool for bypassing "Iron Press" Zamazenta or Corviknight. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is categorized as a **Punching** move, meaning its damage is further amplified by the ability *Iron Fist*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Urshifu (Single Strike Style)**. Mastering the "Tower of Darkness" is the thematic requirement for Urshifu to learn this technique.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, for Urshifu, it serves as the ultimate STAB option that punishes switch-ins who rely on defensive setup or Intimidate cycling (like Incineroar or Landorus-Therian).
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned upon the evolution of Kubfu into Urshifu (Single Strike Style) at the Tower of Darkness.
