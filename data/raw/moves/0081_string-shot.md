## Identity & Mechanics
**String Shot** is a Status Bug-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user spews a spray of sticky, silk-like thread or webbing from its mouth or abdomen to entangle the target. This restrictive, adhesive silk significantly hinders the foe's agility and movement, making it a quintessential move for arachnid and insectoid Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Speed stat by two stages (-2). Prior to Generation VI, this move only lowered Speed by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (In Double and Triple Battles, it hits all adjacent foes).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 95%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Speed Control / Utility.
* **Usage:** While often compared to **Icy Wind** (which deals chip damage) or **Thunder Wave** (which inflicts a permanent status), String Shot offers a more drastic Speed reduction (-2 stages). In VGC or Double Battles, its ability to hit both opponents makes it a powerful **Speed Control** tool, effectively neutralizing **Choice Scarf** users or naturally fast **Sweepers**. It is a common "filler" move on lead Bug-types to facilitate a teammate's cleanup.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. It is a **Spread Move**, meaning its effectiveness is maximized in multi-battle formats.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (70 learners), concentrated heavily among the "Early-Route Bug" archetypes and silk-producing species.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Butterfree**, **Galvantula**, **Volcarona**, and **Vikavolt**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Bug Pokémon with "sticky" or prehistoric themes like **Gastrodon**, **Cradily**, and **Slurpuff** to provide unexpected utility and support.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up by larvae and spider-based Pokémon. While not typically a TM/TR, it has frequently appeared as a **Move Tutor** move in various expansions (such as in Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), allowing many non-Bug types to access it.
