## Identity & Mechanics
**Coaching** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user assumes the role of a tactical mentor, issuing authoritative instructions and encouragement to its teammate. This display of leadership bolsters the resolve and physical conditioning of allies, visually manifesting as a motivational surge on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** In Doubles or Multi-Battles, the user coaches its ally, raising that Pokémon’s **Attack** and **Defense** stats by one stage each. It is the "support" equivalent of the move *Bulk Up*, applied to a teammate rather than the user.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply stat boosts to the target ally).
* **Targeting:** A single ally Pokémon (specifically designed for Doubles/VGC).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Doubles Utility / Physical Support.
* **Usage:** Coaching is a niche but potent **Doubles-exclusive** support tool. Unlike *Helping Hand*, which provides a one-time 50% damage boost, Coaching provides permanent stat increments, making it superior for teammates intended to stay on the field for multiple turns. It is often paired with "Physical Tanks" or "Setup Sweepers" to accelerate their threat level while simultaneously increasing their physical longevity. It bypasses *Protect*, allowing a user to buff an ally even if that ally is guarding itself.
* **Attributes:** This move is not affected by *Protect* (when targeting an ally) and is blocked by *Crafty Shield*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (74 learners), primarily concentrated among Fighting-types and Pokémon with a "leader" or "mentor" aesthetic.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly effective when used by **Zamazenta**, **Urshifu (Rapid/Single Strike)**, and **Cinderace** to support a more powerful physical teammate. Iconic "fighter" Pokémon like **Machamp** and **Hariyama** also utilize it in lower-tier Doubles formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on versatile utility Pokémon like **Mew** or high-speed pivots like **Zeraora**, who can use their speed to apply the buff before the ally attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in the *Isle of Armor* (Gen VIII) and remains available via **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
