## Identity & Mechanics
**Snipe Shot** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user focuses their sight and fires a high-pressure, high-velocity stream of water from their fingertip with the precision of a master marksman. This projectile-based move is designed to find its mark regardless of battlefield distractions, bypassing defensive maneuvers intended to draw fire away from intended targets.
* **Effect:** This move ignores the effects of redirection moves (such as **Follow Me**, **Rage Powder**, or **Spotlight**) and redirection-based Abilities (such as **Storm Drain** or **Lightning Rod**). Additionally, it possesses an **increased critical hit ratio** (Stage 1), making it more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages. 
* **Secondary Effect:** High Critical Hit Ratio (+1 Stage).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Ignores redirection).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Redirection Utility.
* **Usage:** Snipe Shot is primarily used in Double Battles (VGC) to snip targets that are being protected by a teammate's "Follow Me" or "Rage Powder." While its base power is lower than **Hydro Pump**, its perfect accuracy and ability to ignore the suction effect of **Storm Drain** make it a surgical tool for eliminating specific threats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire**, **Ground**, and **Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Pulse-based (not affected by Mega Launcher, but fits the thematic "Sniper" profile). It is a projectile move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (1 learner), serving as the signature move of the Galar Water-type starter evolution line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Inteleon**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not found as a coverage option on other Pokémon. However, when used by **Inteleon**, it pairs exceptionally well with the **Sniper** Ability, which boosts the damage of critical hits—capitalizing on the move's innate high critical hit ratio.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via evolution; Inteleon learns this move immediately upon evolving from Drizzile. It is not available via TM or TR.
