## Identity & Mechanics
**Glaciate** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user exhales a blast of absolute-zero air, freezing the atmosphere around the battlefield. This sub-zero gale coats enemies in a layer of restrictive frost, numbing their limbs and chilling their resolve to significantly hinder their mobility.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to all adjacent opponents and lowers each target's Speed stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Speed (Guaranteed unless the target has an ability like Clear Body or is behind a Substitute).
* **Targeting:** All opponents (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 95%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Speed Control / Spread Utility.
* **Usage:** Glaciate functions as the signature, upgraded version of *Icy Wind*. While its base power is relatively low for a signature move, its value lies in its **guaranteed Speed drop** across multiple targets. In double battles (VGC), it serves as a powerful utility tool to disrupt the opponent's turn order. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, spread-damage move. It is particularly effective at breaking Focus Sashes while simultaneously providing team-wide momentum.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as the **Signature Move** for the legendary Pokémon of the Tao Trio (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kyurem** (Base Form), **Kyurem-White**, and **Kyurem-Black**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it is a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for all Kyurem forms, **Kyurem-White** leverages it most effectively in the Ubers and VGC formats to punish Dragon-type rivals and slow down faster threats like Zacian-Crowned or Calyrex-Shadow.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR; it is part of Kyurem's natural level-up pool or inherent to its legendary status. Under certain conditions (Fusion), it may be replaced by *Ice Burn* or *Freeze Shock*, but it remains a core identity of base Kyurem.
