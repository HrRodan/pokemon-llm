## Identity & Mechanics
**Freezy-Frost** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** The user conjures and launches a massive, shimmering crystal formed from a frigid, ethereal haze. Upon impact, the crystal shatters into an arctic mist that blankets the entire battlefield, instantly neutralizing magical and physical enhancements. This icy vapor is saturated with keyword-rich properties like "frozen," "haze," and "neutralizing."
* **Effect:** Deals direct damage and simultaneously acts as the move **Haze**, resetting all stat stages (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion) of all Pokémon currently on the field to zero.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reset stat changes (inherent to the move's primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Damage); All active Pokémon (Stat reset).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Anti-Setup Wallbreaker / Utility Nuke.
* **Usage:** Freezy-Frost is a powerful compression tool. It allows the user to deal heavy damage—outclassing the standard *Ice Beam* in raw power—while simultaneously shutting down "Setup Sweepers" who rely on moves like Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, or Calm Mind. It is the ultimate "Check" to runaway stat boosts, ensuring the opponent cannot snowball a lead. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ground, Flying, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact, Special projectile. It bypasses effects like *Substitute* in its specific game of origin to reset stats.
