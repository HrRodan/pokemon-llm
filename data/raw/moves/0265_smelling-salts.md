## Identity & Mechanics
**Smelling Salts** is a physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user releases a sharp, pungent aroma or applies a stinging physical force intended to "shock" the opponent. While the sudden sensory overload deals significant damage, the bracing nature of the scent effectively rouses the target from paralysis.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is currently afflicted with the **Paralysis** status condition, the move's base power doubles from 70 to **140**.
* **Secondary Effect:** If the power-doubling effect is triggered, the target is immediately **cured of paralysis**.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70 (140 if triggered), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Niche Tech.
* **Usage:** Smelling Salts is a high-risk "punishment" move. While a 140 BP hit is massive (comparable to a STAB Explosion or Choice Band-boosted Self-Destruct without the faint), it comes at the high cost of losing the speed control and "parahax" benefit provided by paralysis. It is generally outclassed by **Facade** (which rewards the user for being status-afflicted) or **Return/Double-Edge** for consistent damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **nothing**, as it is a Normal-type move, and is completely resisted by **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (14 total learners), primarily concentrated among humanoid Fighting-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically associated with **Hariyama**, who often learns it naturally. It is also found in the movepools of the **Machamp** line, **Conkeldurr (Timburr)** line, and **Lickilicky**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Hariyama** or **Mienfoo** in lower-tier formats where Body Slam is frequently used to spread paralysis, though it remains a rare "gimmick" pick. 
* **Acquisition:** Smelling Salts is generally learned through **leveling up**; it has historically not been available as a TM or TR, further limiting its viability in competitive teambuilding.
