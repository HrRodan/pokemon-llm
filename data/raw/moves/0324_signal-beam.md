## Identity & Mechanics
**Signal Beam** is a Special Bug-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user emits a strange, flashing beam of multi-colored light from its body or eyes to strike the foe. This vibrant ray of energy is engineered to disrupt the target's senses, potentially leaving them disoriented.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10%** chance to **Confuse** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Special Coverage.
* **Usage:** While outclassed in raw power by *Bug Buzz* (90 BP), Signal Beam is highly valued for its **Distribution**. In competitive formats like Smogon’s lower tiers or past-generation VGC, it serves as vital coverage for non-Bug types to bypass defensive checks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a "Beam" move, it is not currently boosted by the *Mega Launcher* ability (unlike Pulse moves), but it functions as a reliable, non-contact special attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a exceptionally wide distribution (272 learners), largely due to its status as a frequent **Move Tutor** teaching in Generations IV through VII.
* **Prominent Users:** Often seen as secondary STAB on **Volcarona**, **Galvantula**, and **Yanmega**, or as primary Bug STAB for **Ampharos** (especially in its Mega form).
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically essential on Psychic-types like **Alakazam**, **Espeon**, and **Starmie** to hit Dark-type switch-ins and opposing Psychic-types for super effective damage. It is also a staple on **Jolteon** and **Porygon-Z** to round out their offensive movepools.
* **Acquisition:** While rarely a TM, it was a ubiquitous **Move Tutor** move in *Platinum*, *HeartGold/SoulSilver*, and throughout the Gen 5, 6, and 7 games, making it accessible to a vast array of Pokémon.
