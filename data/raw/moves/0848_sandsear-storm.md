## Identity & Mechanics
**Sandsear Storm** is a Special Ground-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user summons a localized, violent desert tempest, whipping up searingly hot sands and fierce winds to scour the battlefield. This move combines the suffocating pressure of a sandstorm with intense thermal energy, often leaving targets with debilitating burns.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to all adjacent opponents. In specific weather conditions (Rain), this move's accuracy is increased to 100%.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 80%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Spread Damage.
* **Usage:** Sandsear Storm serves as a high-power alternative to Earth Power for Special attackers. While the 80% accuracy is a liability, its ability to hit multiple targets in VGC/Doubles and its high **Burn** probability make it a terrifying utility-offense hybrid. It is particularly potent because Ground-type moves rarely provide status infliction, allowing the user to cripple Physical wallbreakers like Zacian-C or Kingambit while dealing massive damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks in **Rain**. This makes it a unique coverage tool on Rain teams, despite being a Ground-type move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the signature move of the Landorus lineage.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Landorus-Incarnate** and **Landorus-Therian**. Landorus-Incarnate leverages its *Sheer Force* ability (in some formats) or its high Special Attack to turn this into a devastating nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Primarily used as a **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. It allows Landorus-Therian to opt for a Special or Mixed set to surprise physical walls that expect Great Earthquake or Tera Blast.
* **Acquisition:** This is a signature move and cannot be taught via TM/TR; it is learned by Landorus through leveling up or via the Move Reminder in Generation IX.
