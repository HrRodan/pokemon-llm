## Identity & Mechanics
**Heavy Slam** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova region).
* **Description:** The user leverages its massive physical bulk to crush the opponent under its weight. This move’s damage potential is dynamically calculated based on the weight ratio between the attacker and the defender, making it a "Weight-Based Nuke" for the heaviest Pokémon in the ecosystem.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the relative weight of the user compared to the target. The power scales from **40** (if the user is up to 2× the target's weight) to a maximum of **120** (if the user is more than 5× the target's weight).
* **Secondary Effect:** If the target has used **Minimize**, this move deals **double damage** and bypasses all accuracy checks to guarantee a hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Heavyweight Wallbreaker / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Heavy Slam is the premier choice for Pokémon with high weight stats (e.g., over 500kg) to achieve a consistent 100 or 120 Base Power move without the recoil of Steel Beam or the speed-dependency of Gyro Ball. It is highly effective in formats where **Fairy-types** (which are often light, like Flutter Mane or Clefable) are dominant. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact move**, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Its power is significantly boosted by the **Heavy Metal** ability and halved by the **Light Metal** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (144 learners), primarily concentrated among Steel, Rock, and Ground types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Copperajah**, **Aggron**, **Steelix**, and **Melmetal**, all of whom possess the extreme weight necessary to consistently hit the 120 BP cap. **Dondozo** and **Garganacl** are modern top-tier threats that utilize it for defensive pressure.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy non-Steel Pokémon like **Snorlax**, **Groudon**, and **Ting-Lu** to provide essential coverage against Fairy-type checks that would otherwise wall their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
