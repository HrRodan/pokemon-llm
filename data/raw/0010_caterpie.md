## Identity & Lore
Caterpie (Pokedex #010) is the Worm Pokémon, a ubiquitous Bug-type native to the Kanto region (Generation I). This small, green larva is a common sight in forests and wooded areas, where it camouflages among foliage. According to ecological research, its short feet are tipped with suction pads that enable it to tirelessly climb slopes and walls to reach its primary diet of leaves. While Caterpie itself does not possess alternate forms, its final evolution, Butterfree, is capable of achieving a **Gigantamax** form in regions like Galar. It is recognized by the red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators.

## Evolution & Biology
Caterpie is the first stage of a classic 3-stage evolutionary line known for its extremely rapid growth cycle. It evolves into **Metapod** starting at **Level 7**. Subsequently, Metapod evolves into the dual-type Bug/Flying **Butterfree** starting at **Level 10**. This quick maturation allows trainers to access a fully evolved Pokémon very early in their journey. Caterpie belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
