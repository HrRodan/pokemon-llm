## Identity & Lore
Gloom (Pokedex #044) is the Weed Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Poison creature originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This blue, humanoid plant Pokémon is distinguished by the reddish-brown flower on its head and the viscous fluid dripping from its mouth. Contrary to its repulsive appearance, this fluid is not drool but a sweet, sticky nectar used to attract prey. Gloom is infamous for the overpowering stench released from its pistils, which worsens when the Pokémon feels threatened; however, one in a thousand Gloom is said to emit a pleasant fragrance. It typically inhabits grasslands where it can camouflage among noxious weeds. While Gloom does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the crucial branching point for two distinct final evolutions.
