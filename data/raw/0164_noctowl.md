## Identity & Lore
Noctowl (Pokedex #164) is the **Owl Pokémon**, a dual-type **Normal/Flying** avian introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Distinguished by its brown plumage, cream-colored underbelly, and magnificent, bushy eyebrows, Noctowl is a nocturnal predator known as the "Emperor of Dark Nights." Its eyes are specially adapted with minimal light requirements, concentrating even the faintest illumination to see perfectly in pitch darkness. Unlike many Flying-types, Noctowl possesses high intelligence and can rotate its head 180 degrees to sharpen its intellectual power; when it turns its head upside down, it is often signaling that it is processing difficult thoughts. While it learns many Psychic-type moves and exhibits extrasensory abilities, it remains a Normal/Flying type.
