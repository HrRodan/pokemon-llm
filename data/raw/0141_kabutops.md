## Identity & Lore
Kabutops (Pokédex #141) is the Shellfish Pokémon, a ferocious prehistoric predator originally discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Revived from the ancient Dome Fossil, this bipedal creature features a sleek, brown exoskeleton and an upright shape optimized for swimming in its original deep-sea habitat. Kabutops is defined by its deadly scythe-like forelimbs, which it uses to slash prey apart before draining their body fluids. While it has adapted to life on land to hunt, its biological design reflects a mastery of ancient aquatic environments.
