## Identity & Lore
Hitmonlee (Pokedex #106) is the **Kicking Pokémon**, a pure Fighting-type introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This humanoid, brown Pokémon is renowned as a master of kicking techniques, possessing legs that can progressively lengthen and contract like coiled springs to deliver devastating strikes from a distance. Its elastic legs allow it to run with smooth, extra-long, loping strides, often found in **urban** environments or dojos. Hitmonlee is a male-only species and is part of the legendary "Hitmon" trio, with its name paying homage to the martial artist Bruce Lee.

## Evolution & Biology
Hitmonlee is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line derived from the Baby Pokémon **Tyrogue**. It evolves from Tyrogue starting at **Level 20**, but only if Tyrogue's **Attack stat is higher than its Defense stat**. It is one of three potential evolutions for Tyrogue, the others being Hitmonchan (Def > Atk) and Hitmontop (Atk = Def). Hitmonlee belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group.
