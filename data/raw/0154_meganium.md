## Identity & Lore
Meganium (Pokedex #154) is the Herb Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Distinguished by the large pink flower petals around its neck and its vivid green coloration, this quadrupedal Pokémon is known for its ability to manipulate emotions through scent. The aroma that rises from its petals contains a calming substance capable of soothing aggressive feelings and neutralizing the fighting spirit of its enemies. Typically found in grasslands where it can absorb sunlight, Meganium's breath has the power to revive withered grass and plants. While it serves as the final evolutionary stage for the Johto Grass starter, it does not currently possess any known Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms.
