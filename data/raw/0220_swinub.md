## Identity & Lore
Swinub (Pokedex #220) is the Ground/Ice-type Pig Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). This small, brown quadruped resides primarily in cold environments such as caves and icy mountains. It relies heavily on its sensitive snout to forage for food, rubbing it against the ground to detect the scent of mushrooms buried beneath the soil. World lore notes that Swinub often discovers hot springs during its digging, leading to settlements being built around its findings. Although it appears to have its eyes closed, it navigates effectively using sound and smell. It is the base form of the formidable Mamoswine line.

## Evolution & Biology
Swinub is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the Field (Ground) Egg Group. It evolves into **Piloswine** starting at **Level 33**. Piloswine can then evolve into the final form, **Mamoswine**, only when leveled up while knowing the move **Ancient Power**. In the wild, Swinub may occasionally be found holding an Aspear Berry.
