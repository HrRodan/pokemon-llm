## Identity & Lore
Raticate (Pokedex #020) is the Mouse Pokémon, originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). Characterized by its tawny fur and aggressive temperament, this quadrupedal rodent is recognized by its massive incisors, which never stop growing. To keep these fangs filed down, Raticate must constantly gnaw on hard objects, including rocks, logs, and even cinder block walls. It inhabits grasslands and savannas, relying heavily on its long, sensitive whiskers to maintain balance and maneuverability; if these whiskers are damaged or cut, Raticate becomes noticeably slower and clumsy. While this profile details the standard Normal-type form, Raticate possesses a regional variant in the Alola region which is Dark/Normal type.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 81, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 70, Speed 97.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker / Guts Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a valuable **immunity to Ghost**. It takes neutral damage from all other types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its decent Speed and Attack stats, its most viable moveset includes:
    *   **Facade:** Inflicts massive damage when paired with the Guts ability and a status condition (like Burn from a Flame Orb).
    *   **Sucker Punch:** Provides priority coverage against Ghost-types.
    *   **Super Fang:** A signature utility move that cuts the target's HP in half, regardless of defenses.
    *   **U-turn:** Allows Raticate to deal damage and pivot out to a teammate safely.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Run Away:** Ensures escape from wild battles (has no competitive combat utility).
    *   **Guts:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% if the Pokémon has a status condition (Burn, Paralyze, Poison).
    *   **Hustle (Hidden):** Boosts Attack by 50% but lowers physical move accuracy by 20%, turning Raticate into a risky but powerful hitter.

## Evolution & Biology
Raticate is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rattata** starting at **Level 20**. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles. While the standard evolution occurs via leveling, the Alolan form requires leveling up at night, highlighting the species' adaptability to different environmental cycles.
