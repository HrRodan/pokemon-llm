## Identity & Lore
Geodude (Pokedex #074) is the Rock Pokémon, a ubiquitous creature first discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This **brown**, spherical Pokémon possesses strong, muscular arms but lacks legs, relying on its upper body strength to climb rough mountain paths. Often found in fields and mountains, Geodude is famous for its camouflage; it remains perfectly still to blend in with the environment, causing travelers to mistake it for a common boulder and often trip over it. To strengthen their bodies, Geodude are known to bang against each other in contests of durability. While this profile details the standard Rock/Ground form, a regional variant known as **Alolan Geodude** exists, which possesses the Rock/Electric typing.
