## Identity & Lore
Haunter (Pokedex #093) is the Gas Pokémon, a dual-type Ghost/Poison entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Composed of gaseous matter, this purple, spectral Pokémon is characterized by its disembodied hands and a mischievous, predatory grin. According to lore, Haunter possesses the ability to slip through solid block walls, leading to rumors that it originates from another dimension. It inhabits dark caves and abandoned structures, where it stalks potential victims to steal their life force with a lick, often inducing severe shaking or paralysis. While Haunter itself does not change form, its evolution, Gengar, is capable of both Mega Evolution and Gigantamaxing in later generations.
