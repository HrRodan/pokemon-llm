## Identity & Lore
Ponyta (Pokedex #077) is the **Fire Horse Pokémon** introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This quadrupedal creature is characterized by its cream-colored coat and a mane and tail composed of burning flames.

While the standard form is a pure Fire-type, a Psychic-type regional variant known as **Galarian Ponyta** exists in the Galar region, identifiable by its cotton-candy-like mane.
