## Identity & Utility
**TR01 (Body Slam)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Body Slam**. Unlike TMs in its debut generation, a TR is a **consumable** item that breaks after a single use. It provides access to a reliable, high-power Normal-type physical attack.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive). In its home region of Galar, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Body Slam** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Body Slam is a Physical Normal-type move with **85 Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It has a **30% chance** to induce the **Paralysis** status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 85 (High). Using Fling with TR01 deals significant physical damage but consumes the record.
    * **Competitive Use:** Body Slam is a highly valued move in both casual playthroughs and competitive formats (like Smogon or VGC) for physical attackers. It is particularly effective on bulky Normal-types (e.g., **Snorlax**) or Pokémon with the **Serene Grace** ability (which doubles the paralysis chance to 60%).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR01 is frequently available from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price in Watts. It is also a common reward for defeating Normal-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is typically manufactured or rewarded through Galar's Raid ecosystem. It is a core component of a trainer's mid-to-late game arsenal for optimizing physical movepools.
