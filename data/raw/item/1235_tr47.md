## Identity & Utility
**TR47** (Technical Record 47) is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized data disc that teaches the move **Dragon Claw** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are **consumable** and break after a single use. It is a one-time-use item that can be bought or earned through gameplay.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (interpreted as a **Moderate Investment**; often purchased with Watts in the Galar region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a compatible Pokémon, it teaches the move **Dragon Claw**. 
    * **Move Specs:** Dragon Claw is a Physical Dragon-type move with 80 Power and 100% Accuracy. It has no secondary effects but provides consistent, reliable damage with no drawbacks (unlike *Outrage* or *Draco Meteor*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage for the move Fling, but provides no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly relevant for physical Dragon-type attackers (e.g., Garchomp, Haxorus, Dracovish) in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is the gold standard for reliable Dragon-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) without the locking mechanic of Outrage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for move acquisition.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR47 is primarily obtained by defeating Dragon-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via **Max Raid rewards** or through the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Context:** TRs represent a return to the classic "single-use" mechanic of move-teaching items, intended to encourage players to participate in the Raid economy of the Galar region to "farm" powerful moves.
