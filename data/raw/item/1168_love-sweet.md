## Identity & Utility
**Love Sweet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A heart-shaped confectionery designed specifically for the Milcery evolutionary line. When held by a Milcery, it reacts to the Trainer’s movements (spinning), triggering a unique biological transformation. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that is generally obtained through specialized activities rather than standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Milcery**, performing a "Spin" (rotating the joystick rapidly) causes Milcery to evolve into **Alcremie**. The Love Sweet specifically determines the aesthetic outcome: the resulting Alcremie will feature **heart-shaped decorations** in its cream.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. The item is consumed upon evolution and provides no tactical benefit in battle. Its value is strictly for "Forme" collection and Pokedex completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is one of seven "Sweets" (including Strawberry, Berry, Clover, Flower, Star, and Ribbon). While the Sweet determines the decoration, the Alcremie's "flavor" (color) is determined by the duration of the spin, the direction, and the time of day.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, Love Sweets are primarily awarded as prizes for defeating Cafe Masters in **Battle Cafes** (found in Motostoke, Hammerlocke, and Wyndon). They can also be obtained via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor or as rewards from **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. 
* **Lore:** These sweets are highly prized by pastry chefs in the Galar region. The bond between a Trainer's "happy spin" and the Milcery's reaction to the sugar results in the diverse patterns of Alcremie, which is a mascot for high-end Galar dessert shops.
