## Identity & Utility
**Water Gem** is a **Jewel (Competitive Held Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized gemstone imbued with aqueous energy. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically priced at 200 Poké Dollars, though it is rarely found in standard retail environments, typically requiring manual discovery or special acquisition. 
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, but acquisition is usually limited to exploration rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging **Water-type move**, the Water Gem increases the power of that move by **1.5×** (in Generation V) or **1.3×** (in Generation VI and later). The item is **consumed immediately** after the move is executed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems generally cannot be used effectively with Fling or have a power of 0).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **former staple of Generation V competitive play**. It allows for a "nuclear" single-turn burst of damage, often used to bypass specific defensive benchmarks. In modern formats, its utility is diminished due to the power nerf (1.3×) and its general unavailability in newer regions.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Unburden:** Consumption of the Water Gem immediately triggers the **Unburden** ability, doubling the user's Speed.
    * **Acrobatics:** Once consumed, the user is considered to be holding no item, doubling the base power of the move Acrobatics.
    * **Recycle:** Cannot be recovered via the move Recycle if consumed in most competitive formats, though mechanics vary by generation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found in **Dust Clouds** within caves across the Unova region. In later generations, gems (aside from the Normal Gem) became rare event-only items or were hidden in specific late-game areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be gathered through environmental phenomena (like mining or shaking spots).
* **World Knowledge:** The Water Gem represents a "high-risk, high-reward" tactical choice. Unlike a Mystic Water (which provides a permanent 1.2× boost), the Water Gem is designed for a single, decisive strike to secure a Knockout (KO) that would otherwise be impossible.
