## Identity & Utility
**Orange Mail** is an **All-Mail** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a "cute Zigzagoon print" used for player-to-player communication. It is a **Consumable Social Item** that is held by a Pokémon to carry a custom-composed message. 
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a set list of words and phrases. When the Pokémon holding the Orange Mail is traded, the recipient can read the message. The message can be deleted to make the item reusable or stored in the Trainer's PC for later viewing.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Defensive Utility.** In the generations where Mail is active, a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot** have its item removed or swapped by moves such as *Thief*, *Covet*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo*. Additionally, the **Sticky Hold** ability is redundant for a Mail-holder. It is primarily used in casual playthroughs or to protect a specific (though usually non-existent) strategy from item-theft.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. While held, the Pokémon **cannot be placed in the PC**, forcing the player to remove the Mail before managing their storage boxes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically sold at Poké Marts in the Hoenn and Kanto (FRLG) regions. As a basic tier of Mail, it is readily available to trainers early in their journey.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The "Zigzagoon print" mentioned in the flavor text is a thematic nod to the common Generation III Normal-type, but it does not appear as a held item via the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
* **Legacy Note:** Mail items were largely phased out of the series starting in Generation VI, making this a legacy item primarily relevant to Retro-Gen mechanics and speedruns/Nuzlockes requiring item-loss protection.
