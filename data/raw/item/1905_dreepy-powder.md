## Identity & Utility
**Dreepy Powder** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed by members of the Dreepy evolutionary line. It is a consumable resource used exclusively at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine to manufacture TMs. It cannot be used as a medicine or held in battle for any strategic effect.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily valued for its exchange rate into League Points (LP) or its utility in crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines. In the Paldea region, it is combined with League Points (LP) to produce high-value moves often associated with Ghost or Dragon-type Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in a competitive battle setting (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held or used during combat. Its significance is entirely limited to the preparation phase (teambuilding) to teach Pokémon new moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop from defeating or capturing wild members of the Dreepy line. It can also be found as a "sparkling" pickup on the ground in habitats where these Pokémon reside, such as the wetlands or river biomes of the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is dropped by wild **Dreepy**, **Drakloak**, and **Dragapult**. Players seeking to optimize their roster often farm this material to craft powerful late-game TMs like **TM114 (Shadow Ball)** or **TM156 (Outrage)**.
