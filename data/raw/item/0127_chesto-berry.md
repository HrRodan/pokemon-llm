## Identity & Utility
**Chesto Berry** is a **Consumable Medicine (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized berry that acts as a status-curing agent. It is a holdable, single-use item that can be used manually from the Bag or automatically triggered in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Highly Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Cures the **Sleep** status condition. If held by a Pokémon, it is consumed immediately upon falling asleep (including self-induced sleep from the move *Rest*) to wake the user up. If used from the Bag, it functions like an Awakening.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Activates the "berry-effect" on the target, curing them of sleep).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Water-type** attack with **80 Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple**, most famously utilized in the **"ChestoRest"** strategy. This allows a bulky Pokémon to use *Rest* to fully restore HP and cure all other status conditions, then immediately wake up via the Berry, bypassing the standard two-turn sleep penalty. It is also a common niche pick to counter "Sleep Spam" strategies involving moves like *Spore* or *Sleep Powder*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Harvest** (which can regenerate the berry after use) and **Unburden** (which doubles the user's Speed after the berry is consumed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in Berry patches across most regions (Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, etc.). In many games, it can be purchased cheaply at specialized Berry shops or the standard Poké Mart after certain milestones.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently carried by wild Pokémon, most notably **Snorlax**, the **Whismur** evolutionary line, **Spinda**, **Minccino**, and **Mimikyu**. These can be efficiently farmed using moves like *Thief*, *Covet*, or the *Pickup* ability in certain generations.
