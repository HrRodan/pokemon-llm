## Identity & Utility
**Moon Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone that is as black as the night sky. It is a **Consumable** item used to trigger the evolution of specific Pokémon species. Unlike standard stones, it is historically associated with cosmic or nocturnal themes.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range**). While it has a set price, it is frequently found through exploration rather than early-game Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon from the Bag, it triggers an immediate evolution. It is consumed upon use. The following species are affected:
    * **Nidorina** → Nidoqueen
    * **Nidorino** → Nidoking
    * **Clefairy** → Clefable
    * **Jigglypuff** → Wigglytuff
    * **Skitty** → Delcatty
    * **Munna** → Musharna
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. However, it is the gatekeeper to several **Competitive Staples**, specifically **Clefable** (a premier Fairy-type utility tank) and **Nidoking** (a powerful Sheer Force special attacker). 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This stone is a "static" evolution trigger; it does not require a trade or specific level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Sinnoh-based games (Gen IV), it is a common find in the **Underground**. In other regions, it is typically found in craters, caves (like Mt. Moon or Meteor Falls), or via specific shops in the late-game.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a notable farming target. Wild **Clefairy**, **Cleffa**, **Lunatone**, and **Jigglypuff** have a small chance (typically 5%) of holding a Moon Stone. 
* **Farming Strategy:** Trainers often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase hold rates) and the move **Thief** or **Covet**, or utilize the **Pickup** ability at higher levels to gather multiple stones for completing the Pokédex.
