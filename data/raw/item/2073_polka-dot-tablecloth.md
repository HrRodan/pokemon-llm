## Identity & Utility
**Polka-dot Tablecloth** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative item used to customize the aesthetic of the player's campsite. It is a **Cosmetic Overworld** item that can be purchased and reused indefinitely. Unlike held items or medicines, it serves no function in combat.
* **Cost:** 1500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, they can choose to spread this tablecloth over the table. It changes the visual appearance of the picnic setup to a white fabric adorned with a black polka-dot pattern.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly for overworld flavor and player customization. It provides no statistical or tactical advantages in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is within the **Picnic Mechanic**, which is used for breeding Pokémon Eggs and preparing Sandwiches for various "Meal Powers" (e.g., Encounter Power, Sparkling Power).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at **Picnic Knacks** specialty stores located in major Paldean cities such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It must be bought from a vendor.
* **World Context:** In the Paldea region, picnicking is a cultural staple for trainers. Tablecloths like the Polka-dot variant allow trainers to express personal style while resting their team or hunting for Shiny Pokémon through sandwich-making.
