## Identity & Utility
**Red Nectar** is a **species-specific** form-change item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A vibrant flower nectar found primarily in the meadows of the Alola region. It is a **consumable** item used outside of battle to alter the biology of specific Pokémon. Unlike evolutionary stones, it transitions a Pokémon between forms rather than advancing its evolutionary stage.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on an **Oricorio**, it changes the Pokémon into its **Baile Style**. This shift alters Oricorio’s primary typing to **Fire/Flying** and changes its signature move, Revelation Dance, to the Fire type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low; provides no additional effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Pre-battle Preparation.** Since it cannot be used during a battle, its utility lies entirely in team building. Baile Style Oricorio is favored for teams needing a Fire-type special attacker with the "Dancer" ability, particularly in doubles formats where it can chain-react with other dancing moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item is **single-use**; it is consumed upon changing the Oricorio's form. It does not trigger evolution but is essential for accessing the Fire-type variant of the species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered at **Ula’ula Meadow** in the Alola region. In subsequent generations (like Gen IX), it can often be purchased at general stores (such as Delibird Presents) once the player has progressed sufficiently.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon; it is traditionally gathered from flower patches in the overworld or purchased from specialty vendors. It is one of four nectars (Yellow, Pink, Red, and Purple) that correspond to the different islands and Oricorio styles.
