## Identity & Utility
**TM157 (Outrage)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk* expansion).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to permanently teach a Pokémon the Dragon-type move **Outrage**. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly at a TM Machine once unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Outrage** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Outrage is a high-power Physical Dragon-type move (120 Power, 100% Accuracy). The user rampages for 2–3 turns, attacking a random opponent, and becomes **Confused** afterward.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact Physical Sweeper Tool.** Outrage is a staple for physical Dragon-types like **Dragonite, Garchomp, Haxorus,** and **Roaring Moon**. While it locks the user into the move—making them vulnerable to Fairy-type switch-ins which are immune—it provides immense raw neutral damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited to Pokémon with the biological capability to learn high-tier Dragon-type maneuvers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Blueberry Academy (Terarium)** during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. It can be found as a collectible item in the wild (often in the Canyon or Polar Biomes) or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM157, trainers typically require:
    * **8,000 LP**
    * **Dratini Scales** (x5)
    * **Axew Scales** (x3)
    * **Gible Scales** (x3)
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating or catching wild Dragon-type species such as the **Dratini** or **Axew** lines.
