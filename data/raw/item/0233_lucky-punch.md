## Identity & Utility
**Lucky Punch** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A pair of lucky boxing gloves designed specifically for Chansey. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought for a moderate price, though it is rarely available in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained through field exploration or wild encounters.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Standard/Moderately Cheap).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Chansey**, it raises the holder’s critical hit ratio by **two stages** (+2). This significantly increases the likelihood of landing critical hits (bringing the base rate from 4.17% to 50% in modern generations).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 40 (Deals low physical damage when thrown; the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** In competitive play (Smogon or VGC), Chansey is almost exclusively seen holding the **Eviolite** to bolster its massive defensive potential. The Lucky Punch is considered a "meme" or high-risk strategy because Chansey’s offensive stats are extremely low, making critical hits—while frequent—relatively weak.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item only functions for Chansey. It does not provide the critical hit bonus to its pre-evolution, Happiny, or its evolution, Blissey. It does not trigger any specific evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specific locations like the Safari Zone or the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree exchange services. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is a signature drop for the Chansey line. It can be found on wild **Chansey** and **Happiny**. Trainers looking to farm this item often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet**, or rely on the **Pickup** ability in specific games.
* **Lore context:** The item's design as "boxing gloves" reflects a more aggressive side of the typically pacifist nurse Pokémon, though it remains more of a collector's curiosity than a staple of Chansey’s kit.
