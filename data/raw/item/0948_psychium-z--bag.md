## Identity & Utility
**Psychium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is the "Bag" representation of the Psychium Z. It is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade Psychic-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Key Item / Non-consumable Held Item** that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; restricted to story progression or specific events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with a Psychic-type move, it allows the use of the Psychic-type Z-Move: **Shattered Psyche**. The power of the move depends on the base power of the original move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VII Meta).** In the Sun/Moon era, Psychium Z was frequently used by high-tier threats like **Tapu Lele** and **Mew** to deliver a high-damage "nuke" move to bypass traditional walls. It also sees use for its "Z-Status" effects; for example, **Z-Hypnosis** increases the user's Speed by one stage, and **Z-Trick-or-Treat** increases all stats by one stage.
    * **Item Protection:** As a Z-Crystal, this item cannot be removed by Knock Off, stolen via Thief/Covet, or swapped via Trick/Switcheroo.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-enhancement tool tied to the Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is acquired via story progression. It is typically found at the **Altar of the Sunne** or **Altar of the Moone** (depending on the version) during the player's quest to encounter the box legendary (Solgaleo or Lunala).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item granted to the trainer.
* **World Knowledge:** While this specific JSON entry refers to the "Bag" data (the internal placeholder for the crystal's existence in the player's inventory), it functions identically to the Psychium Z held item during battle. In the Alolan trials lore, Z-Crystals are considered manifestations of the bond between trainer and Pokémon, powered by Necrozma's light.
