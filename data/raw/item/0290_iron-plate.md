## Identity & Utility
**Iron Plate** is a **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A legendary stone tablet inscribed with ancient power. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is primarily used to enhance Steel-type offense or alter the form of specific Pokémon. While it has a technical price, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically discovered through exploration.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap, but acquisition is usually limited to one or two per playthrough).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of its **Steel-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High base power for the move Fling, making it a viable one-time heavy physical hit).
    * **Competitive Use:** In standard play, it is often outclassed by *Life Orb* or *Choice Band* for damage. However, it is mandatory for **Arceus-Steel**, as it changes Arceus’s type and its signature move, *Judgment*, to Steel. It is also preferred over the *Metal Coat* for Steel-type boosting when the player wants to avoid the trade-evolution associations of the latter.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Multitype:** If held by a Pokémon with the Multitype ability (Arceus), the holder becomes a **Steel-type**.
    * **Legendary Lore:** It is one of the elemental plates linked to the creation of the Pokémon world.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized locations such as the **Sinnoh Underground**, the Ruins of Alph, or given by NPCs near historical landmarks (e.g., Oreburgh City or Route 13 in Unova). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** found on wild Pokémon. It must be obtained via environmental discovery (Dowsing Machine), the Underground mining minigame, or as a static treasure pick-up.
* **Attributes:** Its `underground` tag indicates it is a recurring reward for players engaging in fossil-hunting and excavation mechanics.
