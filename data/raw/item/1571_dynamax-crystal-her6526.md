## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (HER6526)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, single-use event item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until midnight of the day it is used. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that is not available through standard gameplay or shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal; though assigned a low price, it is historically a promotional item distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Ruins in the Galar Wild Area. The internal ID "HER6526" specifically corresponds to the event crystal for **Gigantamax Corviknight**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None as a held item. However, it is highly valuable for competitive preparation as it allows players to guarantee an encounter with a Pokémon that possesses high IVs, a Hidden Ability, or the Gigantamax Factor, which can then be used in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** (an otherwise empty raid den). It does not trigger evolution but provides access to rare Pokémon variants.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed as a promotional bonus. Specifically, "HER" crystals were often bundled with physical purchases (such as the Sword & Shield Double Pack) or distributed through retailers like GameStop or Best Buy via serial codes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "out-of-game" acquisition item, categorized alongside other Event/Key-style consumables.
