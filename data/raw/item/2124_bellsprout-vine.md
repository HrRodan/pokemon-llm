## Identity & Utility
**Bellsprout Vine** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Bellsprout evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or, more importantly, exchanged at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM). It **cannot** be bought from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 25 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Trading value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a fundamental component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). Players must combine Bellsprout Vines with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine to create specific move-teaching discs. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to out-of-battle preparation and move-pool expansion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a direct byproduct of the Bellsprout family. It cannot be used as a Held Item to trigger effects like *Pickup* or *Klutz*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as loot in the Paldea region or the Land of Kitakami. It is acquired by defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Bellsprout line.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, this material is dropped 100% of the time by wild **Bellsprout**, **Weepinbell**, and **Victreebel** upon their defeat or capture. It is a primary target for players looking to craft Grass or Poison-type utility moves.
