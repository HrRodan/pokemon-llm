## Identity & Utility
**Glimmet Crystal** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A material dropped by the Glimmet evolutionary line. It is a consumable crafting component used primarily at TM Machines located at Pokémon Centers. Unlike traditional held items, it is a resource used for move customization rather than direct battle utility.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In the Paldean economy, these materials are often exchanged for League Points (LP) or used in recipes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is utilized in recipes for powerful moves such as **TM116 (Stealth Rock)**, **TM148 (Sludge Bomb)**, and **TM171 (Tera Blast)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. While the item itself has no competitive presence, it is a mandatory resource for players to obtain high-tier competitive moves in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting reagent. It is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag and cannot be given to a Pokémon to hold.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Glimmet** or **Glimmora**. It can also be found as sparkling pickups on the ground in rocky or cave biomes, particularly within the **Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero)** and various caves throughout the region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item; it is a post-battle reward. It is most efficiently farmed by battling Glimmet in the caves of the Dalizapa Passage or Glimmora within Area Zero. It interacts with the **Let's Go!** auto-battle mechanic, allowing for rapid accumulation.
