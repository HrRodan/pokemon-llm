## Identity & Utility
**TM160 (Giga Drain)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration during **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item is a single-use (in Gen IX) data disc used to teach the move **Giga Drain** to compatible Pokémon. As a TM in the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, it represents a permanent unlock for the TM Machine's crafting library once obtained.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Scarlet & Violet*, it must be crafted using 8,000 LP and specific Pokémon materials (3× Hoppip Leaf, 3× Capsakid Seed, and 3× Skiddo Leaf).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Giga Drain**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Grass-type, Special Attack, 75 Base Power, 100% Accuracy. 
    * **Secondary Mechanic:** Restores the user's HP by 50% of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Essential.** Giga Drain is a cornerstone move for bulky Grass-type Special Attackers (e.g., Venusaur, Amoonguss, Hydrapple). It provides necessary longevity and chip damage, making it a staple in both VGC (doubles) and Smogon (singles) formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a vital tool for Pokémon with the ability **Triage**, which gives this move priority, or **Big Pecks/Liquid Ooze** counter-play.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Discovery:** Found as a collectible item within the **Terarium** (specifically the Coastal or Savanna Biomes) at Blueberry Academy.
    * **Crafting:** Once found, it can be replicated at any TM Machine using League Points and materials harvested from wild Grass-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is an artificial data medium intended for Trainer use only.
