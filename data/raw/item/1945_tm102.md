## Identity & Utility
**TM102 (Gunk Shot)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the move **Gunk Shot**. In the Paldea region, TMs are single-use consumables that can be manufactured at any Pokémon Center using the Technical Machine Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars. It is **Not for sale** via traditional currency; instead, it requires a combination of League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials to craft.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Gunk Shot** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Type:** Poison (Physical).
    * **Power:** 120.
    * **Accuracy:** 80%.
    * **Effect:** Has a 30% chance of poisoning the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be held or used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact Physical Coverage.** Gunk Shot is the premier physical Poison-type move, used primarily by physical attackers to threaten Fairy-type and Grass-type walls. Despite its shaky 80% accuracy, its high base power makes it a staple for Pokémon like **Cinderace**, **Muk-Alola**, and **Overqwil** in competitive formats (Smogon/VGC).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Crafting:** Accessible at the TM Machine. Requires **5,000 LP**, **3x Grimer Toxins**, **3x Croagunk Sweat**, and **3x Varoom Scraps**.
    * **World Locations:** Typically found as a TM capsule in high-level areas of the Paldea region, such as the **Tagtree Thicket** or the **North Province**, or awarded by the Battle League representative after defeating a specific number of trainers in a designated area.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required for its creation are farmed from the **Grimer**, **Croagunk**, and **Varoom** evolutionary lines through battle or the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature.
