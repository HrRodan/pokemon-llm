## Identity & Utility
**Sinistea Chip** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Sinistea evolutionary line. It represents a fragment of the possessed teacup. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a currency/component at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is required to craft specific TMs to expand a Pokémon's movepool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** Indirect. While the chip has no utility in a live match, it is essential for the competitive ecosystem as it is a required ingredient for crafting **TM054 (Psyshock)** and **TM161 (Trick Room)**—two high-priority moves in both VGC and Smogon singles formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the *Chipped Pot* or *Cracked Pot*, the Sinistea Chip is strictly a material and does **not** trigger the evolution of Sinistea into Polteageist.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop by defeating or catching wild **Sinistea** or **Polteageist**. In the Paldea region, these are commonly found in the ruins and outskirts of the South Province (Area Six) and East Province (Area Three).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item does not occupy a held item slot; it is automatically added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon a successful encounter with the Sinistea line. It is frequently farmed by players using the "Auto-Battle" (Let's Go!) feature in areas with high Sinistea spawn rates.
