## Identity & Utility
**Mixed-Mushrooms** is a **Curry-ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A culinary ingredient used exclusively for cooking at Pokémon Camps. It is prized for its chewy texture, which significantly alters the profile of the resulting dish. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought and used in the overworld "Curry Dex" minigame.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at a Pokémon Camp, this item serves as the base ingredient to create various types of **Mushroom Curry**. Depending on the Berries added alongside it, the quality of the curry (Koffing to Charizard Class) determines how much HP and PP are restored to the party, as well as the amount of Experience Points and Friendliness gained.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or ranked ladder play as it cannot be used or held to provide a benefit during battle. It is strictly a "Playthrough" or "Completionist" item for the Curry Dex.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with specific combat abilities. Its value is tied entirely to the **Pokémon Camp** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from **Ingredient Sellers** found throughout the Galar region's Wild Area (such as those in the Rolling Fields or near Hammerlocke Hills). Their stock rotates daily, but Mixed-mushrooms are a frequent staple.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Tiny Mushrooms or Big Mushrooms (which are "Nugget-tier" sellable items often found on Paras or Foongus), Mixed-mushrooms are treated as a specialized food resource for the Galar region's unique camping culture.
