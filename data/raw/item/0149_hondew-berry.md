## Identity & Utility
**Hondew Berry** is a **Consumable Berry (Effort-Drop)** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A specialized fruit that functions as a dual-purpose nutritional supplement. It increases a Pokémon’s Friendship (Happiness) while simultaneously decreasing its Special Attack Effort Values (EVs). It is a **Consumable** item that is generally **Cheap/Accessible** once unlocked in a playthrough.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon, it **lowers Special Attack Effort Values by 10** and increases Happiness (friendship) by a variable amount (10/5/2 depending on the current friendship tier). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Ground-type** attack with **90 Power** (Generation IV+).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no utility as a held item in actual combat, it is a **Metagame Staple** for "EV Training." It is used by competitive players to "fix" or reset the stats of a Pokémon if they have accidentally gained Special Attack EVs or wish to reallocate those points into defensive or physical stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolutions directly, but the Friendship boost it provides can help reach the threshold required for Friendship-based evolutions (e.g., Eevee to Espeon/Umbreon, or Lucario).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry Trees across most regions (Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, etc.). In recent titles like *Sword & Shield* or *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be found at Berry trees in the Wild Area or purchased from specialized vendors in late-game markets.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon in the provided data.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Pokémon world, these berries are often described as having a unique taste that Pokémon find endearing but which physically alters their "base points" (EVs), allowing trainers to fine-tune their partners' growth. It belongs to a cycle of six berries (Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, Tamato) that each lower a specific stat.
