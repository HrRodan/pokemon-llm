## Identity & Utility
**Impish Mint** is a Nature-altering consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herbal item that, when used on a Pokémon, realigns its stat growth patterns to match the **Impish** Nature (+Defense, -Special Attack). While the Pokémon's actual Nature remains unchanged (for breeding purposes), its stats are recalculated to reflect the new growth rates. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is generally considered a high-value resource.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (In-game, this usually represents a high-value exchange currency like 20 BP or 20,000 LP/Poké Dollars depending on the specific title’s marketplace).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently alters the Pokémon's stat multipliers. It increases the **Defense** stat by 10% and decreases the **Special Attack** stat by 10%. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Staple.** Mints revolutionized the competitive scene by allowing players to "fix" the stats of Legendary, Shiny, or Event Pokémon that were previously unusable due to suboptimal Natures. The Impish Mint is specifically prized for **Physical Walls** and "Bulky Offense" Pokémon that do not rely on Special moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely for stat optimization. It allows a Pokémon to retain the benefits of its original Nature (such as flavor preferences for Berries) while gaining the statistical advantages of the Impish Nature.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sword/Shield:** Purchased at the Wyndon Battle Tower for 20 BP. 
    * **Scarlet/Violet:** Available at Chansey Supply shops for 20,000 Poké Dollars after reaching a specific gym badge threshold, or found as rare sparkling pickups in the overworld (notably in the North Province).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. These are processed herbal items typically distributed through official Pokémon League channels or specialized pharmacies like Chansey Supply. They are often gathered as rewards for high-level Tera Raid Battles or Ace Academy Tournaments.
