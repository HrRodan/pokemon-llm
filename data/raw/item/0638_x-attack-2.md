## Identity & Utility
**X Attack 2** is a **Miracle-Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** A specialized, battle-only enhancement item designed for use with the Wonder Launcher mechanic. It sharply raises a Pokémon's physical offensive capabilities. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that **Cannot** be bought with standard currency. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired exclusively through the accumulation of points during Wonder Launcher-enabled battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon currently in battle, it **raises the target’s Attack stat by two stages** (a "sharp" increase). This effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out or if the battle ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is restricted to the "Wonder Launcher" battle sub-format found in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. Because the Wonder Launcher was an optional gimmick and did not return in subsequent generations, this item has no place in standard Smogon or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is functionally a higher-tier version of the standard X Attack, providing double the stat boost in a single turn at the cost of requiring Wonder Launcher points.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is only available within battles where the **Wonder Launcher** setting is enabled. Players must wait for their point gauge to fill (accumulating 1 point per turn) to "purchase" the item mid-battle. It is not found in Marts or the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It does not exist as a physical item in the player's standard bag, but rather as a digital selection within the Miracle Shooter interface.
