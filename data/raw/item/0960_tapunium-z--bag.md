## Identity & Utility
**Tapunium Z (Bag)** is a species-specific **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to allow the island guardians of Alola to upgrade their signature move. It is a **Key Item / Held Item** (represented here in its Bag form) that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique story acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Tapu Koko**, **Tapu Lele**, **Tapu Bulu**, or **Tapu Fini**, and if the Pokémon knows the move **Nature's Madness**, it allows the use of the exclusive Z-Move: **Guardian of Alola**.
    * **Guardian of Alola Effect:** This move summons a giant avatar that smashes the opponent, dealing fixed damage equal to **75% of the target's remaining HP**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/High-Impact. While many Tapus prefer items like *Choice Specs* or *Terrain Extender*, Tapunium Z is a potent "wall-breaker" tool. It is particularly effective against extremely bulky defensive threats (like Chansey or Toxapex) because it ignores defensive stats to shave off three-quarters of the opponent's health instantly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly tied to the **Tapu** legendary quartet. It cannot be removed or stolen by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by a compatible Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is typically obtained after the player becomes the Alola Region Champion. Upon battling **Tapu Koko** at the Ruins of Conflict following the credits, the player receives the crystal as a sign of recognition by the island guardians.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique reward tied to Alolan lore and the player's status as Champion. It represents the bond between the trainer and the deities of Alola.
