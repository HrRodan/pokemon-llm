## Identity & Utility
**Max Revive** is a **Consumable Medicine** (Revival category) introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A high-potency restorative medicine used to return a fainted Pokémon to battle-ready status. Unlike the standard Revive, it provides a complete recovery. It is a **consumable** item that can be used both during battle and in the overworld, though it cannot be used on Pokémon that are still conscious.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a listed price, it is historically unavailable for purchase in standard Poké Marts, serving as a rare "find-only" reward or endgame utility.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Revives a single Pokémon from a "Fainted" (0 HP) state and **fully restores 100% of its maximum HP**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Essential.** In competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), bag items like Max Revives are strictly prohibited. In casual play or Nuzlocke challenges, it is the most valuable recovery item, often reserved for the Elite Four or Legendary encounters to save "turns" that would otherwise be spent on a Revive followed by a Potion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is the direct upgrade to the **Revive** (which only restores 50% HP). It is frequently found by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at higher level tiers (usually Level 71-100).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as hidden items or in late-game locations like Victory Road. It is also accessible via the **Sinnoh Grand Underground** (denoted by its `underground` attribute). In most regions, it is considered a rare resource that cannot be mass-produced by trainers.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Linoone**. This makes the Linoone line a primary target for trainers using "Thief" or "Covet" to farm high-end medicinal supplies.
