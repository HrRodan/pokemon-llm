## Identity & Utility
**Greet Mail** is a **Social/Correspondence Item** (categorized as "all-mail") introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** Stationery designed for introductory communication between Trainers. It is a consumable social item that allows a player to compose a message from a predetermined list of words and attach it to a Pokémon for trading. Once the message is erased, the item can be reused, or the message can be archived in a PC.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates player-to-player messaging during trades. When held by a Pokémon, it carries a custom-built message that the recipient can read.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Anti-Removal Mechanic:** A Pokémon holding Greet Mail is immune to moves that remove or steal items, such as **Thief**, **Covet**, **Trick**, **Switcheroo**, or **Knock Off**. The item cannot be forcibly taken from the holder in battle.
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically, Mail saw niche use in specific challenge runs or older formats as a "permanent" item to prevent item-swapping strategies, though it provides no statistical or tactical advantage otherwise.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Greet Mail **cannot be placed into the PC**. This forces the Trainer to remove the Mail before the Pokémon can be stored, acting as a safeguard to ensure messages aren't "lost" in storage.
    * **Inventory:** It does not interact with abilities like Pickup and is not used for any Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Unova region and other regions where Mail is supported. Due to its low price, it is one of the most accessible items in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly a retail item intended for Trainer communication.
* **Lore context:** Greet Mail represents the social era of Pokémon (specifically the C-Gear era in Gen V), where local and global trading encouraged polite introductions between players who might be trading for the first time.
