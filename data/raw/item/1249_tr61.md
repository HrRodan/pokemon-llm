## Identity & Utility
**TR61 (Bug Buzz)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item used to instruct a compatible Pokémon in the move **Bug Buzz**. Unlike the TMs of its generation, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, making them a consumable resource for high-tier move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive; though primarily traded for Watts in the Galar Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Bug Buzz**, a powerful Special Bug-type attack.
    * **Move Stats:** 90 Power / 100% Accuracy.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High physical impact, but generally a poor use of a rare machine).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High.** Bug Buzz is the gold standard for Special Bug-type attackers (e.g., Volcarona, Ribombee, Vikavolt). Its most significant competitive trait is being a **sound-based move**, allowing it to bypass the move **Substitute** to hit the opponent directly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for Special-based Bug-type Pokémon to maintain offensive pressure. It is often a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option in VGC and Smogon formats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR61 is primarily obtained by defeating Bug-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–8,000 Watts). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly tied to the Galar region's Raid infrastructure and the currency generated by Power Spots.
* **Context:** The shift from TMs to TRs in Gen VIII reintroduced the strategic need to farm resources for competitive move-sets, with TR61 being one of the most sought-after records for Bug-type specialists.
