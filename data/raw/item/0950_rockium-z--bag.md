## Identity & Utility
**Rockium-Z (Bag Variant)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This specialized crystal converts Z-Power to upgrade Rock-type moves into devastating Z-Moves. In the context of the "Bag" variant, it represents the crystal as stored in the player's inventory, functioning as a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or lost.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique story-related acquisition.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one **Rock-type attacking move**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the Z-Move **Continental Crush** once per battle. If used with a Rock-type status move (e.g., *Stealth Rock*), it grants a **Z-Power effect** (Defense +1) in addition to the move's normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be thrown via Fling, nor can they be removed from a Pokémon by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Generation VII).** Rockium-Z was a premier choice for physical attackers like **Garchomp**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Tyranitar**. It allowed these Pokémon to bypass traditional "walls" (like Skarmory or Celesteela) with a high-base-power nuke that ignores accuracy checks and bypasses *Protect* (at 25% damage).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It requires a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** in the player's inventory to function in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the Rockium-Z is obtained by defeating **Olivia**, the Kahuna of Akala Island, during her Grand Trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact tied to the Alolan Island Challenge. Unlike standard items, it is not affected by the **Pickup** ability or **Klutz** (the Pokémon can still use the Z-Move even with Klutz, as it is a fundamental mechanic of the crystal).
