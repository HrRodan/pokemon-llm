## Identity & Utility
**Basil** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A fragrant, culinary herb used exclusively as a component for crafting sandwiches during Picnics. It is a consumable ingredient that provides specific flavor profiles (primarily Bitter and Sweet) to influence Meal Powers. It cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 280 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich, Basil contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. It is a core ingredient in several recipes, including the Vegetable Sandwich, Herb Sausage Sandwich, and various "Hefty" or "Master" variants. It specifically boosts:
    * **Flavor Profile:** Increases Bitter and Sweet values.
    * **Meal Power Influences:** Commonly associated with **Exp. Point Power**, **Encounter Power**, and **Raid Power**, particularly for Fire, Psychic, and Grass types depending on the supplementary ingredients.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held; Basil is a picnic-only item).
    * **Competitive Use:** None in active combat. Its utility is strictly "Meta-Game," used to streamline the breeding, training, and hunting of competitive-ready Pokémon through Sandwich buffs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is ignored by abilities like Pickup or Harvest as it is categorized as an ingredient rather than a berry or medicine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased at **Sure Cans** or **Aquiesta Supermarket** locations across the Paldea region. Availability in shops usually requires the player to have earned at least 0-3 Gym Badges depending on the specific vendor's inventory locks.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a processed commercial good rather than a naturally occurring item in the wild.
