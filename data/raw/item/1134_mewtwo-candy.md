## Identity & Utility
**Mewtwo Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy-packed treat designed exclusively for the Mewtwo evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be used as a held item in battle. Unlike traditional vitamins that target single stats, this item provides a holistic boost to the Pokémon's growth.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily used for consumption rather than commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Mewtwo, it increases **all six permanent stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** each. This contributes to the **Awakening Values (AVs)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series, which allows a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** While vital for maximizing Mewtwo's potential in the *Let's Go* ecosystem, this item and the AV system do not exist in traditional VGC or Smogon formats (Generation VIII onwards), where Effort Values (EVs) are the standard. In *Let's Go* competitive play, maxing stats with these candies is essential for "No Restrictions" formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat augmentation. It bypasses the limitations of standard vitamins (like Protein or Iron), which have caps in the *Let's Go* series that Species Candies do not.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (LGPE) by sending Mewtwo to Professor Oak, catching wild Mewtwo (in rare instances or via specific events), or through the Poké Ball Plus "stroll" mechanic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Since Mewtwo is a unique, static Legendary encounter, players must typically rely on catching mechanics or Poke Ball Plus rewards to accumulate large quantities of this candy.
* **Lore Context:** Represents the concentrated essence of a specific species, allowing a trainer to "awaken" the latent power within that specific Pokémon line more efficiently than generic training methods.
