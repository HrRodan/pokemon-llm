## Identity & Utility
**TM73** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. 
* **Description:** This item is a data-disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In early generations (Gen 4), it was a single-use consumable; however, from Generation V through VII and in Generation IX, it is typically reusable or craftable. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * *Historical Context:* In Generations IV through VII, TM73 teaches **Thunder Wave** (a status move that paralyzes the target, reducing their Speed and potentially preventing movement).
    * *Modern Context:* As of the Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet data (referenced in the flavor text), TM73 teaches **Cross Poison** (a physical Poison-type move with a high critical-hit ratio and a 10% chance to poison the target).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Thunder Wave (Legacy):** A **Competitive Staple**. It is one of the most dominant speed-control tools in VGC and Smogon singles, used to neutralize fast sweepers.
        * **Cross Poison (Modern):** A **Niche** offensive choice. It is primarily used on Pokémon with the *Sniper* ability (like Drapion) to capitalize on the high critical-hit rate.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for movepool expansion and is ignored by abilities like *Pickup*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Traditional:** Usually purchasable at large Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone or Lilycove) or awarded by Gym Leaders/NPCs.
    * **Modern (Gen IX):** Can be crafted at the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It must be found as overworld loot, received as a quest reward, or purchased from specialized vendors.
