## Identity & Utility
**Tarountula Thread** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Tarountula evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. While it has a low resale value, its utility lies in unlocking and creating specific moves.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Basic Material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item has no direct effect in battle or on a Pokémon’s stats. Its sole purpose is to serve as a **currency/reagent** for crafting TMs. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in a competitive setting. Its value is strictly for the "Preparation" phase of a team—crafting the TMs required to teach competitive moves to a roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is not an evolution item. However, it is fundamentally tied to the **Tarountula** and **Spidops** species. In the TM crafting system, it is typically required for Bug-type or thread-based moves such as **TM021 (Pounce)**, **TM132 (Baton Pass)**, or **TM105 (X-Scissor)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively in the Paldea region. It is not sold in Poké Marts but can be "sold" to the TM Machine for League Points (LP) or to vendors for a small amount of Poké Dollars.
* **Wild Held Item/Drops:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Tarountula** or **Spidops**. Because Tarountula is one of the first Pokémon encountered in the Paldea region (frequently found hanging from trees in South Province), this material is usually the first crafting component a trainer acquires. It cannot be gathered via the Pickup ability, as it is a localized drop-on-defeat mechanic.
