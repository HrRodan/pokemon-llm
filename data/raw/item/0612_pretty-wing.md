## Identity & Utility
**Pretty Wing** is a **Loot Item** (specifically "Vendor Trash") introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** Despite its aesthetic appeal, it is a completely mundane feather with no inherent power. It belongs to a class of items that exist solely to be sold to vendors for profit. Unlike its counterparts (the "EV Wings" like Health Wing or Muscle Wing), it has no effect on a Pokémon's stats or growth.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Value**). While it has a high internal cost value, it is primarily used to generate cash in the early-to-mid game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** No functional utility. Its only purpose is to be sold at Poké Marts or to specialized item maniacs for currency.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Very Low). It deals minimal damage and provides no secondary status effects when thrown.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a "dead" item in competitive play (VGC/Smogon). It provides no tactical advantage and occupies a held item slot that could be used for viable items like a Focus Sash or Life Orb.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** trigger evolution and has no interaction with Pokémon abilities beyond being a valid target for **Thief**, **Covet**, or **Knock Off**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in the Unova region (Gen V), often appearing as "shadows" on bridges (such as the Skyarrow Bridge or Marvelous Bridge).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is frequently held by wild **Wingull** and **Pelipper**. Trainers often farm this item using the **Pickup** ability or by using moves like **Thief** on wild bird Pokémon to accumulate wealth quickly during a playthrough or Nuzlocke.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of Generation V, the Pretty Wing acts as a "booby prize" or common drop when a player is hunting for the much more valuable Effort Value (EV) Wings. While it looks identical to a Swift Wing or Genius Wing in the overworld, its lack of utility makes it purely an economic resource.
