## Identity & Utility
**TM220 (Meteor Beam)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that provides a Pokémon with the knowledge of the move **Meteor Beam**. As a modern TM, it is a single-use consumable in the Generation IX engine, though it can be crafted repeatedly once unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Poke Marts; requires **8,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials to craft at a TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Meteor Beam** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Meteor Beam is a high-power (120 BP), Special Rock-type move. 
    * **Mechanism:** It is a two-turn move. On the first turn, the user gathers energy and increases its **Special Attack** stat by one stage. On the second turn, it deals damage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be utilized via Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Competitive.** Meteor Beam is a staple for Special Attackers (like Nihilego, Glimmora, or Lunala) when paired with a **Power Herb**. This combination allows the user to gain a +1 Special Attack boost and fire off a 120-power STAB move in a single turn, making it a premier "setup and nuke" option in both VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under "All Machines" and is restricted to the TM Machine crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Blueberry Academy (Terarium)** via *The Indigo Disk* expansion. It is typically obtained by defeating a specific number of trainers in a biome or found as a high-value collectible item on the ground (often in the Canyon Biome).
* **Crafting Recipe:** To replicate TM220, the player requires:
    1. **8,000 LP** (League Points)
    2. **5x Minior Core**
    3. **3x Glimmet Crystals**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; acquisition is strictly through exploration or the TM Machine crafting interface.
