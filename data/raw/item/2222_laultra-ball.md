## Identity & Utility
**Laultra-ball** (Hisuian Ultra Ball) is a **Standard-ball** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, high-performance Poké Ball engineered in the Hisui region. It features a superior success rate for capturing wild Pokémon compared to the Great Ball or standard Poké Ball. As a historical variant, it represents the pinnacle of ancient Poké Ball craftsmanship. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally **crafted** rather than bought in traditional shops.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Special Acquisition**). In its native setting, it is primarily obtained through crafting or as a reward for increasing Survey Corps Rank.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides a high catch rate multiplier (typically **2.0x**) when used on a wild Pokémon. It is the most effective "standard" ball available in the Hisui region before moving into specialized heavy or leaden ball categories.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The **Fling** move does not exist in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*; therefore, this item cannot be flung in a competitive context).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-competitive.** This item is restricted to single-player Hisui-based gameplay and cannot be held by Pokémon transferred to modern competitive formats (e.g., VGC or Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a capture mechanic. It interacts with the **Crafting** system, requiring specific raw materials to produce.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available via **Crafting** recipes unlocked at higher Star Member ranks within the Galaxy Expedition Team. It can also be purchased from the Jubilife Village general store once the player has progressed sufficiently in the story.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike modern Ultra Balls, which can sometimes be found via the **Pickup** ability in other regions, the Hisuian Ultra Ball is strictly a result of human manufacture or Survey Corps distribution.
* **Lore Context:** The "LA" prefix (Legends: Arceus) distinguishes this ball's mechanical behavior and aesthetic from the modern Ultra Ball. It features a distinct steam-venting animation upon a successful capture, characteristic of Hisuian technology.
