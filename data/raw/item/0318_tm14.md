## Identity & Utility
**TM14 (Blizzard)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation I** (though listed as Generation III in some internal datasets, it has been a staple since the series' inception).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Blizzard**. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the generation) that provides a powerful Ice-type offensive option. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Moderate**). Note: In many games, the price for high-tier TMs like Blizzard fluctuates between 5,500 and 30,000 depending on the region's Department Store or whether it is sold via LP (League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Blizzard** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Blizzard is a high-power Ice-type Special move (110 Power in modern gens; 120 in older gens) with 70% accuracy.
    * **Special Property:** In **Hail** or **Snow**, Blizzard bypasses accuracy checks to hit 100% of the time. It also has a 10% chance to freeze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Blizzard is the primary offensive tool for "Ice Weather" teams (utilizing Abomasnow or Alolan Ninetales). In VGC (Doubles), it is particularly potent as it hits both opposing Pokémon simultaneously.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited to Pokémon with "Ice-type" compatibility or those capable of elemental mastery (e.g., Nidoking, Mew).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM14 is historically found in late-game areas or major **Department Stores** (such as the Lilycove, Goldenrod, or Celadon City Department Stores). In newer regions like Paldea, it is crafted at the TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically a fixed-location item found in icy environments like **Seafoam Islands**, **Mt. Lanakila**, or **Frost Cavern**.
