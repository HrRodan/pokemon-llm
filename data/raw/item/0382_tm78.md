## Identity & Utility
**TM78** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A reusable (or single-use, depending on the generation) data disc used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. In modern iterations, it teaches **Bulldoze**, a Ground-type physical attack.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a Pokémon.
    * **Modern (Gen V – Present):** Teaches **Bulldoze**. This move deals damage (60 Power) to all adjacent Pokémon and has a 100% chance to lower the Speed stat of the targets by one stage.
    * **Legacy (Gen IV):** Teaches **Captivate**. This move lowers the Special Attack of the target by two stages, but only if the target is of the opposite gender to the user.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Bulldoze:** Highly valued in **VGC (Doubles)** for speed control, as it hits both opponents and reduces their speed. It is also a reliable early-to-mid-game Ground coverage move for physical attackers in single-player playthroughs.
        * **Captivate:** Extremely niche and rarely seen in competitive play due to the gender-dependency mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Move compatibility varies widely; most Ground-types, heavy-set Pokémon, and many evolved starters can learn Bulldoze.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * Typically available for purchase at **Poké Marts** or large Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone, Goldenrod, or Wyndon).
    * In **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials (typically Mudbray Mud and Sandygast Sand).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured human-made tool. It is often found as a "ground item" (yellow Poké Ball sprite) in cavernous or mountainous routes.
