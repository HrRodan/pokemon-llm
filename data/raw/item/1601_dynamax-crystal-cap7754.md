## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cap7754)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Wild Area of the Galar region. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that causes a specific Pokémon to appear in a den for a limited time.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a listed internal cost, it is not available for purchase through standard Poké Marts and is typically acquired via special distribution.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone structure in the West Lake Axewell area of the Wild Area), it activates a red beam that initiates a Max Raid Battle with a predetermined Pokémon. This encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon competitive formats as it cannot be held in battle and only functions in the overworld to facilitate a raid.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanic at the Watchtower Lair. It does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** during promotional events (e.g., retail partnerships with stores like GameStop, Best Buy, or as pre-order bonuses for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "event-only" resource designed to give players access to specific encounters (such as Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or version-exclusives) regardless of their current progress or game version.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals like the `cap7754` variant were essential for the early-game acquisition of rare Pokémon. Once the crystal is consumed and the raid is cleared, the item is removed from the inventory.
