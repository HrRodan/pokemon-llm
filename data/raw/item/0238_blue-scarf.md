## Identity & Utility
**Blue Scarf** is a **Contest Scarf** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An accessory to be held by a Pokémon specifically for performance environments. It is a **Holdable Contest Item** that, while technically assigned a low purchase value, is generally acquired through special NPC interactions rather than standard retail.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it boosts the Pokémon's **Beauty** condition during the Visual Competition (Introduction Round) of a Pokémon Contest or Super Contest. This increases the number of hearts received from the audience/judge, making it easier to win higher-rank ribbons.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; provides no secondary status effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Combat.** It has zero utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it does not modify combat stats (Attack, Speed, etc.). It is a mandatory staple for players aiming to complete the "Master Rank" Beauty Contests.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is one of five colored scarves (Red, Blue, Pink, Green, Yellow) that correspond to the five Contest conditions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained by showing a Pokémon with a near-maxed **Beauty condition** (enhanced via Blue Pokéblocks or Poffins) to the **Pokémon Fan Club Chairman** in Slateport City or Hearthome City. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically a reward for "maxing out" a specific trait, serving as a badge of expertise in Pokémon grooming and aesthetics.
