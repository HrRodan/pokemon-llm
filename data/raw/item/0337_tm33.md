## Identity & Utility
**TM33** is a Technical Machine (TM) that has been a staple in the Pokémon series since **Generation I**.
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding device used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. As a "Machine" category item, its primary function is move-pool expansion. While early generations treated TMs as single-use consumables, later iterations (Gen V–VIII) made them infinite-use, and Generation IX introduced a crafting mechanic for them.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/Premium pricing). This reflects its status as a high-value tactical asset, typically sold in major Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Historically, TM33 teaches the move **Reflect**, a Psychic-type status move that reduces physical damage taken by the user's team for five turns. 
    * *Variation Note:* According to the provided metadata for Sword/Shield, TM33 teaches **Rain Dance** (Weather-changing move). In Generation II, this slot was occupied by **Ice Punch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** 
        * **Reflect:** A cornerstone of "Dual Screens" strategies (Reflect + Light Screen), essential for hyper-offense teams to setup safely. 
        * **Rain Dance:** Vital for "Rain Teams" to enable the *Swift Swim* ability or boost Water-type move power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is essential for customizing the "coverage" or "support" capabilities of a Pokémon, often making the difference in whether a Pokémon is viable in the competitive meta (Smogon/VGC).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Department Stores:** Usually purchasable for 10,000 Poké Dollars in major cities.
    * **Crafting (Gen IX):** Can be manufactured at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
    * **Overworld:** Often found as a yellow item ball in late-game routes or high-tier gyms (e.g., given by Sabrina in Kanto).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. TMs are artificial human-made objects and are typically gathered through purchase, gift, or exploration rather than farming via the **Pickup** ability.
