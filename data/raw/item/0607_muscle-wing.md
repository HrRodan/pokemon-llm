## Identity & Utility
**Muscle Wing** (formerly known as Muscle Feather) is a **Vitamin/Medicine** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A consumable medicine used to slightly boost a Pokémon's physical prowess. It is a single-use consumable that can be purchased in specific specialized markets but is more frequently obtained through exploration. Within the Vitamin hierarchy, it serves as the precision-tier counterpart to **Protein**.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a single Pokémon's **Attack Effort Values (EVs)** by **1 point**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Competitive Staple** for EV fine-tuning. While standard Vitamins (like Protein) grant 10 EVs, the Muscle Wing allows trainers to reach exact numerical benchmarks (e.g., reaching 252 EVs exactly or hitting a specific "jump point") without overshooting or needing to engage in tedious wild Pokémon grinding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is unaffected by most hold-item abilities as it is primarily used from the bag menu, though it cannot be used on a Pokémon that has already reached the 252 Attack EV cap or the 510 total EV cap.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered in the shadows on the **Driftveil Drawbridge** and **Marvelous Bridge** in the Unova region. In later generations (Gen VIII and IX), it can be purchased at specialized shops (like the Chansey Supply) or found as "sparkling" floor items in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Historically, these items are gathered by trainers observing "shadows" on bridges or through the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets in later games. In the Paldea region (Gen IX), they are common rewards for participating in **Tera Raid Battles**.
