## Identity & Utility
**PP Max** is a **Vitamin** medicine introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A high-tier enhancement medicine that "optimally" raises the maximum PP of a single move to its absolute limit in one use. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally rare and often restricted from standard Poké Mart inventories. 
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value**). While it has a defined price, it is typically treated as a rare find rather than a common commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon out of battle, it increases the maximum PP of a selected move to **1.6x (a 60% increase)** of its original base value. This is equivalent to applying three "PP Up" items simultaneously, reaching the maximum possible PP for that move. It also provides a minor boost to the Pokémon's **Happiness** (5/3/2 points depending on current friendship levels).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Critical Staple.** Maxing PP is mandatory for competitive play (VGC/Smogon) to prevent "PP stalling." It is especially vital for moves with low base PP (e.g., 5 PP moves like *Draco Meteor* or *Recover*), as it increases their usage count from 5 to 8. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a core target for the **Pickup** ability at high levels, making it a farmable resource for dedicated players.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as hidden items in late-game areas, rewarded through the Pokémon Lottery Corner (Loto-ID), or purchased at specialized facilities like the **Battle Frontier, Battle Maison, or Battle Tree** using special currency (BP). It is rarely found in standard Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a high-level reward for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability (typically level 81-100), such as **Munchlax, Linoone, or Ambipom**, representing the "treasure hunting" aspect of those species.
