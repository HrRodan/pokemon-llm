## Identity & Utility
**Yache Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A holdable berry that triggers automatically in response to specific elemental threats. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically purchasable but primarily sourced through cultivation or wild encounters. 
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a **super-effective Ice-type attack**, the berry is consumed to **halve (50% reduction)** the damage taken from that single hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; typically not used for Fling unless desperate to trigger a specific berry-related ability on a teammate).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes an **Ice-type** attack with **80 Power** (Gen IV-V) or **60 Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple**, particularly for Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Ice, such as **Garchomp, Dragonite, Landorus-T, and Salamence**. It allows these high-threat attackers to survive a 4x Ice Beam or Hidden Power Ice to either set up (e.g., Swords Dance/Dragon Dance) or counter-attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * It interacts with the ability **Unnerve**, which prevents the opponent from eating it. 
    * Can be recycled via the **Harvest** ability or the move **Recycle**.
    * Synergizes with **Belch**, becoming usable after the berry is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in berry plots or obtained from Berry Master NPCs across various regions. In Sinnoh, it is often found on Route 212.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature held item for the **Starly** line (**Starly, Staravia, and Staraptor**). Trainers can farm these berries by using moves like **Thief** or **Covet** on wild encounters or by utilizing Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets.
