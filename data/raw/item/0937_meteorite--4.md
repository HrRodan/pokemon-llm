## Identity & Utility
**Meteorite (Variant 4)** is a **Key Item** (classified internally as 'unused') introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A specialized celestial stone originally obtained at Mt. Chimney in the Hoenn region. It features a unique surface pattern that glows with a seven-colored light. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While this specific variant is categorized as "unused" in general item lists, Meteorites in the Pokémon franchise serve as the catalyst for **Deoxys's Forme Change**. When a player interacts with a Meteorite while Deoxys is in the party, it cycles through its Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Formes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** It is not a held item and provides no direct combat statistics; however, it is essential for players to optimize Deoxys for specific competitive tiers (e.g., using the Defense Forme for hazards or Speed Forme for lead utility).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the DNA of the Mythical Pokémon **Deoxys**. In the Alola region (Gen VII), meteorites are typically housed at the **Hokulani Observatory** on Ula'ula Island.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, this item is part of the inventory logic for the meteorites found at **Hokulani Observatory**. Players must travel to the observatory to interact with the stones to trigger the transformation for Deoxys.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique plot-related object tied to the lore of the Hoenn region's Mt. Chimney and the Delta Episode, later brought to Alola for research purposes.
* **Lore Context:** The "seven colors of light" mentioned in the flavor text suggest the meteorite has been infused with high levels of cosmic energy, likely related to the energy required for Mega Evolution or the presence of Rayquaza and Deoxys.
