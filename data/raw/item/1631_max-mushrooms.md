## Identity & Utility
**Max Mushrooms** is a rare resource and stat-boosting item introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield, specifically the Isle of Armor expansion).
* **Description:** A clusters of mushrooms pulsing with Dynamax energy. While the flavor text indicates they can be used to boost all stats of a Pokémon during a battle, their primary significance is serving as the key ingredient for **Max Soup**. They are a **Consumable Form-Change** item that can technically be sold but cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive; highly valued for their rarity and utility in unlocking Gigantamax forms).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during a battle, Max Mushrooms function similarly to an "Ancient Power" boost, increasing the Pokémon's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each. 
* **Gigantamax Interaction:** Outside of battle, three clusters of Max Mushrooms can be cooked into **Max Soup** at the Master Dojo. Feeding this soup to a Pokémon with the Gigantamax factor allows it to G-Max; feeding it to a Pokémon that is already capable of Gigantamaxing will remove that factor.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Competitive.** In-battle stat-boosters are generally banned in standard VGC and Smogon formats. However, their role in enabling Gigantamax forms was central to the Generation VIII competitive meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the only way to grant the **Gigantamax Factor** to Pokémon that do not naturally possess it (e.g., a starter Pokémon or a specific Shiny Pokémon). It is particularly essential for Urshifu to achieve its Single Strike or Rapid Strike Gigantamax forms.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively found on the **Isle of Armor** within the Galar region. They spawn in humid environments such as the Brawlers' Cave, Courageous Cavern, Forest of Focus, and Warm-Up Tunnel.
* **Spawn Mechanic:** Unlike standard items, Max Mushrooms reappear based on player activity. Completing **Max Raid Battles** on the Isle of Armor accelerates their growth; typically, one mushroom cluster spawns for every three raids completed.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. They are strictly a forageable resource tied to the Dynamax energy concentrations of the island.
