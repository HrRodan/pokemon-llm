## Identity & Utility
**Incinium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (Signature Type) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically tuned to the biological energy of the Incineroar evolutionary line. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that cannot be consumed, traded, or sold. It is categorized as a "held" variant of the crystal, as Z-Crystals occupy the item slot of a Pokémon to function in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This is a unique plot-related item acquired through specific story progression in the Alola region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Incineroar** that knows the move **Darkest Lariat**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the signature Z-Move: **Malicious Moonsault**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Malicious Moonsault Details:** This is a Physical Dark-type move with a **Base Power of 180**. Like its base move, it ignores the target's stat changes (Defense/Evasion buffs).
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals **cannot be used** with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed by Knock Off, stolen by Thief/Covet, or swapped via Trick/Switcheroo).
    * **Competitive Use:** While Incineroar is legendary for its utility (Intimidate, Fake Out, Parting Shot), the Incinium Z saw niche use in Generation VII Smogon and VGC formats as a "nuke" option. It allows Incineroar to bypass defensive setups and deliver a massive burst of damage that standard defensive builds might not expect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It strictly interacts with Incineroar. It is useless if held by any other Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is obtained from Professor Kukui after defeating him/becoming the Champion (provided the player chose Litten or defeated the relevant rival). In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained during the Malie Garden events.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. As a Z-Crystal, it is a "Key Item" style held object, meaning only one is typically obtainable per playthrough, and it cannot be lost or destroyed in battle.
* **Lore context:** Represents the bond between a Trainer and their fully evolved Alolan starter. The animation for Malicious Moonsault depicts Incineroar manifesting a flaming wrestling ring, emphasizing its "Heel" wrestler persona.
