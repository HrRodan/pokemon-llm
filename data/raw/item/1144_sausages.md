## Identity & Utility
**Sausages** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A culinary ingredient used exclusively within the **Pokémon Camp** cooking mechanic. Flavor text specifies these are intended to be boiled before consumption. It is a **Consumable** item used to complete the Curry Dex and provides utility during the main story.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the base ingredient for the **Sausage Curry** family of dishes. When cooked with berries, it restores Pokémon HP and PP, increases friendliness, and provides a significant Experience Point (EXP) boost to the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage with no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item is strictly for the "Curry Dex" and party maintenance during a playthrough. It cannot be used in competitive battle formats (VGC/Smogon) and offers no tactical advantage as a held item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is specifically designed for the Galar-exclusive **Pokémon Camp** feature and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Ingredient Sellers** in the **Wild Area**, **Isle of Armor**, and **Crown Tundra**. Stock at these vendors rotates daily. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is restricted to shop purchases or as occasional rewards from NPCs within the Galar region's wilderness zones. It represents the localized culture of the Galar region, reflecting British-inspired culinary themes.
