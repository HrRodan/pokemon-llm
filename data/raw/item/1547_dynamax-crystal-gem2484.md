## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2484** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event-based consumable item used to trigger specific Max Raid Battles. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax encounter. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal internal value; primarily acquired via serial codes or promotional distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the player can consume this crystal to activate a **Max Raid Battle**. The specific Pokémon summoned depends on the specific event associated with the crystal ID (historically used for encounters like Gigantamax Centiskorch or version-exclusive Larvitar/Jangmo-o). The raid remains active until the end of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) raid encounters to help players catch specific Pokémon or farm Max Rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution but is essential for encountering Pokémon that may otherwise be rare or version-locked. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as **Event-Only** items via serial codes (often through retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, or the Pokémon Trainer Club). They are not available for purchase in-game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital key item typically categorized as a "Gem" used to bridge real-world promotions with in-game encounters.
* **Location Context:** Its utility is strictly tethered to the **Watchtower Lair**, a unique raid den in the Wild Area that remains empty unless a Dynamax Crystal is active.
