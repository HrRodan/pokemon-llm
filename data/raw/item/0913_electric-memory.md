## Identity & Utility
**Electric Memory** is a **Form-change/Type-modifying Memory** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A digital memory disc containing Electric-type data. It is a specialized held item designed specifically for the Pokémon **Silvally**. Unlike consumable items, it is a permanent held item that alters the user's biological and mechanical properties.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though typically acquired as a gift or special event item rather than through retail shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the holder’s type changes to **Electric**. Additionally, the move **Multi-Attack** changes its type to Electric, benefiting from Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Deals physical damage; no additional secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. This item is mandatory for running the **Silvally-Electric** variant. In competitive tiers (like Smogon's lower tiers), Silvally-Electric acts as a fast offensive pivot or utility attacker, utilizing its Electric-type STAB Multi-Attack alongside moves like Parting Shot or Defog. It is generally outclassed by natural Electric types that can hold more powerful items like Life Orb or Choice Specs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **RKS System** ability. It does not affect any Pokémon other than Silvally. If held by another Pokémon, it has no effect other than being a valid target for Fling or Thief.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as part of a set. In the Alola and Galar regions, these are typically handed to the player by Gladion or an Aether Foundation NPC upon receiving a **Type: Null**. It is not found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. These are synthetic items created by the **Aether Foundation** to replicate the "Multitype" ability of the Mythical Pokémon Arceus.
* **Lore context:** The Electric Memory is part of a suite of 17 discs (one for each type except Normal) designed to allow "Project-Beast Killer" (Silvally) to adapt to any combat scenario, specifically to combat Ultra Beasts.
