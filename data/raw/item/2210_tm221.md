## Identity & Utility
**TM221 (Hard Press)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the move **Hard Press** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumable data discs that can be reproduced at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard marts; must be found in the overworld or crafted).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hard Press**, a Physical Steel-type attack. 
    * **Move Logic:** The power of Hard Press is variable, calculated based on the target's remaining HP. The more HP the target has, the greater the move's power (Base Power = 100 × [Current HP / Max HP]).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard for TMs in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Steel-type Coverage.** Hard Press serves as a reliable Steel-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for physical attackers that do not meet the weight requirements to maximize *Heavy Slam* or do not rely on the flinch chance of *Iron Head*. It is particularly effective in VGC and Smogon formats for punishing bulky, full-HP targets like Fairy or Ice types early in a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a teaching tool compatible with various Physical attackers, most notably Steel-types like **Metagross**, **Scizor**, and **Archaludon**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Terarium of Blueberry Academy** (*The Indigo Disk* DLC). It is typically obtained as a fixed item drop in the Canyon Biome or as a reward for Blueberry Quest (BBQ) progression.
* **Crafting Requirements:** As a Gen IX TM, it can be crafted at a TM Machine. Based on world knowledge, this usually requires materials from Steel-type lines such as **Varoom** (Varoom Wheels) and **Magnemite** (Magnemite Screws), alongside a significant amount of LP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; acquired exclusively through exploration or synthesis.
