## Identity & Utility
**TR22 (Sludge Bomb)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Sludge Bomb** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, representing a return to the classic consumable mechanic for high-value competitive moves.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/High-Value). In the Galar region, these are primarily acquired through Watt Traders for 3,000-5,000 Watts or as rewards from Max Raid Battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sludge Bomb**, a Special Poison-type attack with **90 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It carries a significant **30% chance to poison** the target, making it both a high-damage threat and a status-inflicting tool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage). Using Fling with TR22 will deal substantial damage but consumes the record without teaching the move.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Sludge Bomb is the premier Special Poison-type move in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is essential for Special Attackers (such as Gengar, Venusaur, or Nidoking) to check Fairy-type threats like Clefable or Tapu Fini. The 30% poison rate is often a deciding factor in long-game chip damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Poison, Grass, and certain Dark or Ghost-type Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found predominantly in the **Galar Wild Area**. It is a common drop from Poison-type **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from Watt Traders on a rotating daily inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In Galar, TRs are synthesized data records rather than naturally occurring objects, though they are often recovered after defeating powerful Dynamax Pokémon in dens.
