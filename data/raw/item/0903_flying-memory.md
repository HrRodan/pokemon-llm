## Identity & Utility
**Flying Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** A high-tech memory disc containing specialized aerodynamic data. It is a permanent **Competitive Held Item** designed specifically for the Pokémon Silvally. While it has a defined price, it is rarely bought in stores and is typically treated as a collectible mechanical upgrade.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Accessible, though usually obtained as part of a set).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, this item triggers the **RKS System** ability, changing Silvally’s base type to **Flying**. Additionally, it changes the type of the move **Multi-Attack** to Flying.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. In competitive tiers (like Smogon’s lower tiers), Flying-type Silvally acts as a pivot with access to *Defog* and *U-turn*. However, because it occupies the item slot, Silvally cannot hold *Heavy-Duty Boots*, making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock, which is a significant drawback for a Flying-type.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is non-consumable and only functions with Silvally. It is ineffective on any other Pokémon, including its pre-evolution, Type: Null.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut games (*Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*), the Flying Memory is obtained as part of a complete set of 17 memories gifted to the player by **Gladion** or **Wicke** at the Aether House or Ancient Poni Path after the player receives Type: Null. In later generations (like *Sword/Shield*), it is obtained from an NPC in the Battle Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is an artificial, man-made object created by the Aether Foundation to mimic the power of Arceus's Plates.
