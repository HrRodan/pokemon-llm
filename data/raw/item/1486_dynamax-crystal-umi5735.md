## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Umi5735)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that is not typically available through standard gameplay or NPC shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal cost**; however, this value is a placeholder as the item is traditionally acquired through serial codes and special distributions rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific vacant den in the Watchtower Ruins), the player can use this crystal to summon a specific **Max Raid Battle**. The "Umi5735" variant is specifically tied to the summoning of **Lapras** (often a Gigantamax Lapras). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no in-battle effect, it is highly valued for **Competitive Prep**. It allows players to encounter a high-IV Lapras with its Hidden Ability or Gigantamax Factor, which are essential for VGC (G-Max Resonance strategy).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area. It does not evolve Pokémon or interact with standard abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed as a **Mystery Gift** via serial codes. These codes were typically provided through promotional tie-ins, such as pre-orders, movie tickets, or retail events (e.g., the "Gigantamax Lapras & Coalossal" event). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-exclusive event trigger meant to facilitate guaranteed encounters with rare Gigantamax species.
* **Lore Context:** The "Umi" in the serial name is derived from the Japanese word for "Sea," reflecting the Water/Ice typing of the Lapras it summons. It represents a concentrated form of Galar's Wishing Stars, tuned to a specific Pokémon's frequency.
