## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal COM4968** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event-exclusive consumable. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. It functions as a temporal beacon, causing a specific Pokémon to manifest in the lair until the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Technically Cheap**, but effectively **Not for Sale** through standard in-game vendors. These items are typically distributed via serial codes or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it initiates a Max Raid Battle with a predetermined Pokémon (often one that is version-exclusive or possesses a Hidden Ability). The raid persists until the player successfully defeats the Pokémon or the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility tool used for acquisition. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for catching Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs) or specific Gigantamax factors required for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, it is the primary method for triggering encounters that yield high-tier rewards such as Exp. Candies, Dynamax Candies, and rare technical records (TRs).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event Distribution** item. It is not found in the overworld or sold in Pokémon Marts. It is historically linked to retail partnerships (such as promotional codes from GameStop, Target, or Pokémon Center purchases) or pre-order bonuses for the Sword & Shield expansion passes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant for one-time use to facilitate a "Man-made" Raid encounter at the Watchtower Lair.
