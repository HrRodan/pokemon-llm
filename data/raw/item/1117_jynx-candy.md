## Identity & Utility
**Jynx Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy tailored to the Jynx evolutionary line. Unlike standard vitamins, it is a **Consumable Enhancement** item that cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts, though it has a nominal sell value. It is used to boost the Awakening Values (AVs) of specific Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**; typically sold to shops rather than bought).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Jynx** or its pre-evolution **Smoochum**, it grants a **+1 bonus to all stats simultaneously** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) in the form of Awakening Values (AVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move *Fling* is not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is essential for maximizing the potential of Jynx in the *Let's Go* competitive meta, where AVs replace the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. It is non-functional and absent in standard VGC or Smogon formats (Gen 8+).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat reinforcement. It bypasses the limitations of standard size-based candies (Quick, Tough, etc.), as it provides a flat boost to every stat regardless of the Pokémon's level, up to the cap of 200 AVs per stat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in Marts. It is primarily earned through the **Catch Combo** mechanic by catching multiple Jynx in succession, or by transferring Jynx to **Professor Oak**. It can also be obtained by walking a Jynx or Smoochum in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is rewarded directly to the Trainer as a result of successful captures or laboratory transfers. It represents the "essence" or specialized nutrition for the Jynx species.
