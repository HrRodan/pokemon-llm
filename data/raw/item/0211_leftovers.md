## Identity & Utility
**Leftovers** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation III** (historically appearing in Gen II).
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that provides passive, consistent health regeneration. It is a **Competitive Staple** that is holdable and active during battle. While it has a defined internal cost, it is rarely available for standard purchase in most regions, making it a high-value asset.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Premium Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** At the end of every turn, the holder restores **1/16 (6.25%)** of its maximum HP. This effect persists as long as the Pokémon remains active and the item is not removed or negated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally a poor candidate for Fling unless desperate).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is one of the most used items in the history of competitive Pokémon (Smogon and VGC). It is essential for **defensive walls, tanks, and stall builds**, allowing them to survive "passive" damage like Sandstorm, Poison, or Burn, and providing crucial recovery while using moves like *Protect* or *Substitute*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is a prime target for the move **Knock Off** or **Trick**. It interacts favorably with the **Recycle** move if the item is consumed (e.g., by *Fling* or *Bug Bite*) and is often the target of the **Sticky Hold** ability to prevent theft.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in limited quantities as hidden items in the overworld (often in trash cans or under sleeping Pokémon like Snorlax). It is not typically sold at Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Snorlax** and **Munchlax**. 
* **Farming:** In many titles, this item is a high-level reward for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability, making it a common target for late-game item farming.
