## Identity & Utility
**TR31 (Iron Tail)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use data disc used to teach the move **Iron Tail** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records are **consumable** and break after one use. It is primarily used to provide physical Steel-type coverage to a wide variety of Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value, it is more commonly traded for Watts at Wild Area Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Iron Tail**. 
    * **Iron Tail Move Stats:** Type: Steel | Category: Physical | Power: 100 | Accuracy: 75%.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 30% chance to lower the target's Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (Extremely High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR.
    * **Competitive Use:** Iron Tail is a high-risk, high-reward coverage move. It is frequently taught to non-Steel types (like Garchomp, Haxorus, or Dragonite) to counter **Fairy-type** threats. In the Generation VIII competitive meta (VGC/BSS), TR31 was highly valued because it allowed Pokémon to use **Max Steelspike** while Dynamaxed, which raises the user's Defense stat and bypasses Iron Tail's low 75% accuracy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR31 is primarily obtained through **Max Raid Battles** in the Wild Area involving Steel-type Pokémon or high-tier encounters. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts) or found in the Cram-o-matic.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial technological record manufactured for trainers to expand their Pokémon's movepools. In the Galar region, it represents a more "volatile" or powerful set of moves compared to the reusable TMs.
