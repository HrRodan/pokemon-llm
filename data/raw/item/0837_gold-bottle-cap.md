## Identity & Utility
**Gold Bottle Cap** is a high-tier **Loot** and **Training Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A rare, shimmering cap that serves as a premium currency for **Hyper Training**. While categorized as "Loot," it is a non-consumable medicine in spirit, used to maximize a Pokémon's potential. It is an elite-tier item, superior to the standard Bottle Cap, as it targets all of a Pokémon's stats simultaneously.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Special Acquisition**). While it has a high sell value, its utility in competitive play far outweighs its monetary worth.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When traded to **Mr. Hyper** (or specific NPCs in later generations like the one near the Mesagoza Pokémon Center), it instantly boosts all six of a Pokémon's **Individual Values (IVs)** to their maximum theoretical value (31) for the purposes of battle calculations. 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon must typically be at a specific level threshold (Level 100 in Gen VII-VIII; Level 50 in Gen IX) to undergo this process. Hyper Training does not change the Pokémon's actual IVs for breeding purposes; it only affects battle performance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Staple.** This item is the primary method for making Legendary, Mythical, or Shiny Pokémon—which often have sub-optimal IVs—viable for high-level VGC or Smogon competitive play without the need for endless resetting or RNG manipulation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Hyper Training** mechanic. It is highly valued in the post-game "grind" phase.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Rare. Usually obtained through high-end lottery shops (like Treasure Hunt in Festival Plaza), as a reward for Master Rank in Battle Towers, or through rare drops in high-star Max Raid Battles or Tera Raid Battles. In some titles, it can be purchased at the Delibird Presents (post-game) for a very high price or via the Porto Marinada auction.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items gathered via **Pickup**, the Gold Bottle Cap is almost exclusively a reward for endgame achievements or extreme luck in mini-games.
* **Lore context:** Mr. Hyper is a "collector" of these caps, implying they are a nostalgic or aesthetic currency that collectors value more than traditional money.
