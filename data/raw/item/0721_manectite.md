## Identity & Utility
**Manectite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by a Manectric, it allows the Pokémon to react with a Trainer’s Mega Bracelet/Ring to transform into Mega Manectric. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Manectric, this item enables **Mega Evolution**. Upon transformation, Manectric’s base stats increase significantly (specifically Speed and Special Attack), and its ability changes to **Intimidate**, which lowers the Attack stat of opposing Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In competitive play, Mega Stones cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, nor can they be consumed by *Fling* if held by the correct Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VI-VII).** Mega Manectric was a premier "Pivot" in Smogon and VGC formats. By using *Volt Switch* in combination with the *Intimidate* ability granted by the Manectite, it allowed players to constantly cycle through their team while weakening physical attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to the Manectric line. It does not trigger a permanent evolution; the effect is temporary and lasts only for the duration of a battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Manectite is typically a late-game or post-game find. In *Pokémon X & Y*, it is found on Route 16; in *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*, it is located on the Seaside Cycling Road (Route 110). In Generation VII, it was made available via the Battle Tree for 64 BP or through special distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique "Key-like" held item, often requiring the Mega Ring to be upgraded before it can be discovered in the overworld.
