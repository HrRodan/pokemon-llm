## Identity & Utility
**Rash Mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized aromatic herb that modifies a Pokémon's stat growth. When used, it adjusts the Pokémon's stats to match the **Rash** nature (+Special Attack, -Special Defense). It is a **Consumable Medicine** item that can be used from the bag on a Pokémon in the party.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Internal value; typically retails for 20,000 Poké Dollars or 50 BP in post-game shops, making it a **High-Value/Endgame** resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently alters the stat multipliers of a Pokémon. The Pokémon's **Special Attack** will increase by 10%, and its **Special Defense** will decrease by 10%. Note that the Pokémon's "Base Nature" (for breeding or flavor purposes) remains unchanged; only the stat calculation is affected.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** This item is essential for "fixing" the stats of Legendary Pokémon, Shiny Pokémon, or gifted Pokémon that were obtained with non-ideal natures. The Rash nature is specifically favored for **Mixed Sweepers** who need a boost in Special Attack but are willing to sacrifice Special bulk to maintain their physical Speed and Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a quality-of-life mechanic that bypasses the traditional requirement for Everstone-breeding to achieve optimal competitive stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily acquired in post-game locations. In Galar, it is purchased from the **Battle Tower** for 50 BP. In Paldea, it is widely available at **Chansey Supply** outlets after earning enough Gym Badges. It can also be found as a rare hidden item in high-level zones like the Area Zero or the Crown Tundra.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, Mints are treated as rare professional training supplements and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
