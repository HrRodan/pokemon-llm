## Identity & Utility
**Full Restore** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in **Generation I** (represented here by Generation III data).
* **Description:** A premium-tier medical spray that fully restores a Pokémon's health and removes all status complications. It is a consumable item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. It is widely considered the ultimate single-target recovery item in a trainer's inventory.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium Tier**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Fully restores the target Pokémon's HP to 100% and simultaneously cures any major status ailments (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) and Confusion. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Essential.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), medicine items are prohibited. However, in "no-item-limit" playthroughs or Nuzlocke challenges, the Full Restore is a critical resource for surviving the Elite Four and Champion battles, as it provides a "reset" for a Pokémon's condition in a single turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. While it is "holdable" by a Pokémon, it cannot be self-activated by the Pokémon in battle like a Berry; it must be administered by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically unlocked in Poké Marts only after the player has obtained a high number of Gym Badges (usually 7 or 8) or at the Pokémon League. It is a staple of late-game inventory management.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In many games, it can be acquired via the **Pickup** ability by high-level Pokémon (typically Level 41+), making high-level "Pickup squads" a viable method for farming this expensive resource.
* **Hierarchy:** This represents the pinnacle of the healing line, surpassing the **Hyper Potion** (120/200 HP) and **Max Potion** (Full HP only) by combining health restoration with the effects of a **Full Heal**.
