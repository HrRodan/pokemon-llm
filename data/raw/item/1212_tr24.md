## Identity & Utility
**TR24 (Outrage)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Outrage**, a high-intensity Dragon-type Physical attack. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are **consumable** and break after a single use. 
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for **8,000 Watts** via Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a compatible Pokémon, it teaches the move **Outrage**. 
    * **Move Stats:** Power: 120 | Accuracy: 100% | Type: Dragon | Category: Physical.
    * **Move Effect:** The user attacks for 2–3 consecutive turns. After the rampage ends, the user becomes **Confused**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120 (This is the **maximum possible Fling damage**, making it a devastating one-time projectile if used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Risk/High-Reward Staple.** Outrage is a premier physical Dragon-type move for wall-breakers like Haxorus, Garchomp, and Dragonite. However, its usage has become more tactical since the introduction of the Fairy-type; if a Fairy-type switches in during the rampage, the move fails, and the user is left vulnerable.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily interacted with by the **Technical Record** mechanic exclusive to Sword and Shield.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR24 is primarily obtained in the Galar region through two methods:
    1. **Max Raid Battles:** Dropped as a reward for defeating Dragon-type Pokémon in Max Raid Dens.
    2. **Watt Traders:** Periodically sold by NPCs in the Wild Area for Watts (currency earned from dens).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be acquired through raid participation or specialized currency trading, reflecting its status as a "Record" of a powerful, ancient combat technique.
