## Identity & Utility
**Eevium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade a specific move. This version (`bag` internal ID) represents the item as it exists in the player's inventory before being equipped. It is a **Key Item/Held Item** hybrid that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Eevee** that knows the move **Last Resort**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Extreme Evoboost**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Extreme Evoboost:** This status Z-Move grants a **+2 stage increase** to Eevee’s Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed simultaneously.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While Eevee itself has low base stats, the Eevium Z is a **high-risk, high-reward tactical centerpiece**. It is almost exclusively used in "Baton Pass" strategies (where permitted) to transfer the massive +10 total stat boost to a powerful sweeper. In Smogon formats, this item is often marginalized due to restrictions on Baton Pass, but it remains a potent "gimmick" in unranked or specific VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is hard-coded to **Eevee**; it will not function if held by Eevee's evolutions (Vaporeon, Jolteon, etc.).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained by completing a dedicated post-game side quest. The player must defeat the **eight Eevee users** scattered across the Alola region and then return to the Thrifty Megamart to defeat the veteran trainer, Kagetora.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item tied to the player's progress and the bond with the "Eevee Users" of Alola.
* **Mechanical Note:** As a Z-Crystal, it cannot be knocked off (Knock Off), stolen (Thief/Covet), or traded (Trick/Switcheroo) during battle, providing the holder with a permanent item slot that cannot be disrupted.
