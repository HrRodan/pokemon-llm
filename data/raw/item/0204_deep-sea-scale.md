## Identity & Utility
**Deep Sea Scale** is a **species-specific evolution and enhancement item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn Region).
* **Description:** A faint, pink-shining scale specifically tuned to the physiology of Clamperl. It serves a dual purpose as both a specialized combat enhancer and a catalyst for biological transformation. It is a **Holdable item** that can be bought or sold for **2,000 Poké Dollars** (Moderate/Accessible pricing, though often restricted to special vendors or found in the wild).
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by **Clamperl**, it doubles the holder’s **Special Defense** stat. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily utilized in the **Little Cup (LC)** format to turn Clamperl into a formidable special tank. However, it is often overshadowed by its counterpart, the *Deep Sea Tooth*, which boosts Clamperl's Special Attack to nuclear levels.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Evolution:** If a Clamperl holding this item is traded, it triggers an evolution into **Gorebyss**. The item is consumed upon the completion of the trade.
    * **Ability Synergy:** This item is strictly beneficial to Clamperl; it provides no stat bonuses to any other Pokémon, including its evolved form, Gorebyss.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, this item is not found in standard Poké Marts. It is typically discovered on the ocean floor (via the *Dive* HM) or obtained as a choice between it and the Deep Sea Tooth.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is a signature find in deep-sea ecosystems. It can be farmed from wild **Chinchou**, **Lanturn**, **Gorebyss**, **Relicanth**, and **Blue-Striped Basculin**. 
* **Farming Tip:** Trainers looking to evolve multiple Clamperl should use a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability in the lead slot to increase the chance of encountering wild Pokémon holding this item, combined with **Thief** or **Covet** to retrieve it.
