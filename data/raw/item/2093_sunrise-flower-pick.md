## Identity & Utility
**Sunrise Flower Pick** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative pick used during the Sandwich-making process at a Pokémon Picnic. It functions as a structural tool to secure sandwich ingredients. As a specialized picnic accessory, it is a single-use consumable during the mini-game but has no direct utility in Pokémon battles or overworld traversal.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard pricing for cosmetic sandwich accessories).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used during the final stage of sandwich preparation in the Paldean Picnic mechanic. Placing the pick completes the sandwich, allowing the player and their party to consume the meal and activate various **Meal Powers** (e.g., Sparkling Power, Egg Power, or Encounter Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling data).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for the Picnic mini-game. However, the Meal Powers generated by the sandwiches it helps create are vital for competitive players for efficient breeding (Egg Power) and IV/EV training.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. Its primary interaction is within the Sandwich UI.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at **Every Wich Way** specialty shops located in major Paldean cities such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain ingredients, picks are manufactured goods obtainable only through retail.
* **Thematic Context:** Part of a set of floral-themed picks, the Sunrise Flower Pick adds a cosmetic flair to the player's picnic setup, reflecting the cultural emphasis on outdoor dining and social bonding with Pokémon in the Paldea region.
