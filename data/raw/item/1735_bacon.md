## Identity & Utility
**Bacon** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.

    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients are categorized as "Other" items and cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Metagame Utility.** While it has no direct effect in a Pokémon battle, it is used to craft sandwiches that grant **Encounter Power**, **Catching Power**, or **Sparkling Power**, which are essential for competitive players to hunt for specific Tera-type Pokémon or Shiny Pokémon for their teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Picnic** mini-game mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** locations and **Aquiesta Supermarkets** throughout the Paldea region. It is readily available to trainers once they reach their first major city (Mesagoza).
