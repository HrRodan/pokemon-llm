## Identity & Utility
**Striped Bottle** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item serves as a cosmetic customization option for the player's picnic set. When selected, it changes the appearance of the condiment/water bottle placed on the picnic table during the picnic mini-game. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Utility** item (once purchased, it can be swapped freely) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While at a picnic, the player can interact with the picnic basket to "Decorate" the table. Selecting the Striped Bottle replaces the default bottle with one featuring a striped pattern. It provides no functional gameplay bonuses (such as Meal Powers); its purpose is entirely aesthetic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly for overworld roleplay and customization within the Paldean picnic mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. It is categorized under the "Picnic" sub-menu of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available for purchase at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon and cannot be found via the Pickup ability. It is a standard retail item for trainers looking to personalize their camping experience.
