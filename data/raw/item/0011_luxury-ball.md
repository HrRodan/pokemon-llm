## Identity & Utility
**Luxury Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A premium, "comfortable" Poké Ball designed to foster a better relationship between a Trainer and their Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used in battle to capture wild Pokémon or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). It is significantly more expensive than a standard Poké Ball (200) or Ultra Ball (800/1200), reflecting its status as a boutique item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a capture tool with a **1× Catch Rate modifier** (equivalent to a standard Poké Ball). Its true value lies in its secondary effect: it doubles the rate of **Friendship (Happiness) gain**. Specifically, whenever the caught Pokémon’s happiness increases, it receives one additional point. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (JSON indicates null; while holdable, it is not optimized for the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no direct impact on combat stats, it is the **Gold Standard for Friendship-based Evolutions**. Competitors often use Luxury Balls to quickly evolve Pokémon like **Lucario, Togekiss, or Umbreon/Espeon** to reach their final forms for team building. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates the evolution of any Pokémon requiring high Friendship. Pokémon caught in this ball start with a base happiness of **200** (according to short effect data), significantly higher than the standard 70, drastically reducing the time needed to reach the 220 or 160 threshold required for evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at high-end locations such as the **Pokémon League**, **Department Stores (Celadon/Lilycove)**, or specialty shops. In some regions, it is a rare reward for completing specific tasks or contests.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly through retail or as a hidden item in the overworld.
* **World Knowledge:** Due to its sleek black-and-gold aesthetic and unique sparkling entrance animation, it is highly favored by collectors and "Shiny Hunters" who want their rare captures to reside in a high-status container.
