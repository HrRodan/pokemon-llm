## Identity & Utility
**Icium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade a Pokémon's Ice-type moves. In the bag, it represents the player's access to the Ice-type Z-Move mechanic. It is a **Key Item / Special Tool** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique progression item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Pokémon holds an Icium Z and knows an **Ice-type damaging move**, it can perform the Z-Move **Subzero Slammer** once per battle. If the base move is a status move (e.g., Haze), it creates **Z-Haze**, which provides a secondary effect (such as fully restoring the user's HP) in addition to the base move's effect.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be Flung or removed from the holder by moves like Knock Off or Thief).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Gen VII Specific).** In Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon competitive formats, Icium Z was used to give Ice-type attackers (like Kyurem-Black or Weavile) a massive one-time "nuke" to break through defensive walls. It also bypasses the accuracy checks of moves like Blizzard.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Requires the player to have a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** to function. It cannot be used if the Pokémon is Mega Evolved or holding another specialized item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained during the main story in the Alola region. In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is typically found at **Mount Lanakila** (before the Pokémon League) or received from Sina after a battle.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item that cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** Z-Crystals are manifestations of Necrozma's light, deeply tied to the Alolan "Island Challenge" tradition and the bond between Trainer and Pokémon.
