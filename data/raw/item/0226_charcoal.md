## Identity & Utility
**Charcoal** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A combustible fuel source that, when held by a Pokémon, stimulates the intensity of flame-based attacks. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought and sold at specialized shops or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Affordable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the power of the holder’s **Fire-type moves is increased by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **Niche Utility** item. While it lacks the raw power of a *Choice Specs* (50% boost) or the versatility of a *Life Orb* (30% boost with recoil), it is used in specific scenarios where the player wants to boost Fire-type damage (like Eruption or Heat Wave) without being locked into one move or taking passive damage. It is a staple for "Fire Mono-Type" challenges and early-to-mid-game playthroughs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It does not interact with specific abilities beyond standard held-item modifiers (e.g., it is nullified by *Klutz* or *Embargo*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in specialized markets (like the Herb Shop in Lavaridge Town) or found near volcanic and industrial areas (like Fiery Path or the Wela Volcano Park).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature item for Fire-type Pokémon. It can be found with a 5% chance on wild **Vulpix**, **Ninetales**, **Torkoal**, and **Turtonator**. Players can farm this item using moves like **Thief** or **Covet**, or by using a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability.
