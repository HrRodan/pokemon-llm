## Identity & Utility
**Card Key (Let's Go)** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized security badge used to override electronic locks within the Silph Co. headquarters in Saffron City. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be consumed, held by Pokémon, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique story item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While in the player's inventory, it grants the ability to open any locked security doors within the **Silph Co. head office**. This is required to navigate the building's complex 11-floor layout.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and has no impact on competitive battling or stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the environment (the electronic gates of Silph Co.).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained on the **5th floor (5F)** of the Silph Co. building in Saffron City. In the *Let's Go* series, it is typically acquired after a scripted encounter with Team Rocket members (Archer and a Grunt) or found in the hallway.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item provided during the main storyline to facilitate the liberation of Silph Co. from Team Rocket.
* **Lore Context:** The Card Key is a recurring element in Kanto-based games. In the context of *Let's Go*, it represents the player's clearance to bypass Team Rocket's lockdown, eventually leading to the boss fight with Giovanni and the rescue of the Silph Co. President (who then rewards the player with the Master Ball).
