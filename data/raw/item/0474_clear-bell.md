## Identity & Utility
**Clear Bell** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in Generation II (Crystal) and featured significantly in the Generation IV remakes (HeartGold).
* **Description:** An antique, delicate bell that emits a gentle, resonant chime. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be held by Pokémon, traded, or sold. It serves as a mystical tool required to prove the player's worth to legendary encounters.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story-critical acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Clear Bell acts as a ritual catalyst for summoning legendary Pokémon. 
    * In **Pokémon HeartGold**, it is presented to the Kimono Girls at the Bell Tower (Tin Tower) to summon **Ho-Oh**.
    * In **Pokémon Crystal**, it is required to encounter and battle **Suicune** at the Tin Tower.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for story progression and static legendary encounters within the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Kimono Girls** of Ecruteak City, who use the bell's sound alongside their ceremonial dance to call forth the legendary bird of the skies.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **HeartGold:** Obtained from the Kimono Girls after defeating all five in battle at the Ecruteak Dance Theater (requires the Fog Badge and the Tidal Bell/Clear Bell depending on the version).
    * **Crystal:** Obtained from the Radio Tower Director after defeating Team Rocket, or from Eusine/the Wise Trio depending on version-specific requirements.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item that cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore context:** The bell is deeply tied to the mythology of Ecruteak City and the Brass and Bell Towers. It represents the harmony between humans and Pokémon, specifically the bond required to bring Ho-Oh back to the human world.
