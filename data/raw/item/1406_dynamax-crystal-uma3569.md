## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (UMA3569)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item designed to be used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that is technically categorized under Dynamax Crystals and cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal cost in the game data, it is not sold in Poke Marts and is typically distributed via serial codes or special promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, a pillar of light is activated. This initiates a **Max Raid Battle** against a specific Pokémon (determined by the crystal's ID—in this case, the internal designation UMA3569).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating raids to catch Pokémon, obtain Dynamax Candies, or farm Technical Records (TRs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is the only way to encounter certain event-specific Max Raid bosses, which may possess Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), or the Gigantamax factor.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Event Serial Codes** (e.g., through retail partnerships like GameStop or Pokémon Center distributions). It is not available through natural progression or NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is an external catalyst used to manipulate the Max Raid Den system.
* **Context:** In the lore of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated shards of Galar particles that force a localized distortion, allowing a specific Dynamax Pokémon to manifest regardless of the standard raid den rotation.
