## Identity & Utility
**Gold Cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A luxury customization item used to decorate the player's picnic table. It is a **Permanent Cosmetic** item that can be purchased and used repeatedly to change the aesthetic appearance of the picnic set. It serves no functional purpose in gameplay other than visual personalization.
* **Cost:** 15,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive** for a cosmetic accessory).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When active in the Picnic customization menu, the Gold Cup replaces the standard picnic cups with ornate, gold-colored versions. This change is purely visual and occurs during the Picnic mini-game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a flavor/lifestyle item used exclusively in the overworld. It does not provide any buffs to "Meal Powers" or influence Pokémon stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interaction with Pokémon evolution, breeding, or battle-related abilities (like Pickup or Klutz).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Gold Cup is primarily purchased at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities such as **Cascarrafa, Levincia, and Mesagoza**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a retail-exclusive luxury item for trainers looking to show off their wealth during social picnic sessions.
