## Identity & Utility
**TM07** is a **Technical Machine** classified under the **All-Machines** category. While this specific data entry identifies its origin context within **Generation III (Hoenn)**, TM07 is a legacy item appearing in every major title from Generation I through Generation IX.

* **Description:** A specialized data disc used to teach a move to a compatible Pokémon. In its most prominent historical iterations (Gen III–VII), it teaches the move **Hail**. However, its contents are version-dependent: it teaches **Horn Drill** (Gen I), **Zap Cannon** (Gen II), **Hail** (Gen III–VII), **Protect** (Let's Go), and **Pin Missile** or **Icy Wind** in more recent titles.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. TMs are typically single-use in earlier generations (I–IV, BDSP) and infinite-use in others (V–VIII).
    * **Gen I:** Horn Drill (Normal, OHKO)
    * **Gen II:** Zap Cannon (Electric, 100% Paralysis)
    * **Gen III–VII:** Hail (Ice, Weather-changing)
    * **Let's Go:** Protect (Normal, Damage Mitigation)
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in a meaningful way; if attempted, they typically have a base power of 10).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Hail (Gen III-VII):** Used to enable Blizzard accuracy and activate abilities like *Slush Rush* or *Snow Cloak*. Historically niche compared to Sandstorm or Rain.
        * **Protect (Let's Go):** An absolute competitive staple in almost every format to scout moves and stall for turn-based effects.
        * **Zap Cannon (Gen II):** High-risk, high-reward move often paired with *Lock-On*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in Generation III, requiring the player to purchase or find multiple copies for a full team.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Gen III (Hoenn):** Found in the **Shoal Cave** during low tide.
    * **Gen IV (Sinnoh):** Purchased at the **Veilstone Department Store** for 2,000 Poké Dollars.
    * **Let's Go:** Obtained from a Gym Leader or specific NPC as part of the "Protect" teaching sequence.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a man-made technological device usually distributed via Gym Leaders, Department Stores, or found in specialized environments (like caves or icy routes).
