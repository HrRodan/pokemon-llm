## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ari951)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Special Consumable** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; effectively **Not for sale** through standard vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the specific **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area), a red beam of light is activated. This beam initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon (in this case, likely a promotional or event-specific encounter such as Gigantamax Sandaconda or Corviknight, depending on the specific distribution code).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a competitive battle context).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for facilitating encounters. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for obtaining Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities** or **Gigantamax Factors** that are otherwise difficult to find.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These items are exclusively distributed via **Serial Codes** or local wireless events (such as pre-order bonuses or retail promotions like those from GameStop or Dyna Crystal events). They are one-time-use items; once the raid is triggered, the crystal is consumed.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is an event-only key-utility item that bypasses the standard Wishing Piece mechanic to guarantee a specific, rare encounter.
