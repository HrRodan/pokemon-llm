## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cap7773)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it summons a specific Pokémon encounter (denoted by the internal ID cap7773) that remains active until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable** item that is **not typically bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). Note: In practice, this item is priceless as it is distributed via special promotional events rather than currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the player can use this crystal to activate a Max Raid Battle. The specific Pokémon spawned by "cap7773" is tied to promotional distributions (such as Gigantamax Copperajah, Duraludon, or other event-specific Pokémon).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held in battle and has no direct impact on competitive play stats or mechanics. Its value lies entirely in the **Acquisition Phase** of team building, allowing players to catch Pokémon with specific Hidden Abilities, Gigantamax factors, or high IVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not evolve Pokémon or interact with standard abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is historically available only through **Serial Code distributions**. These codes were often provided as pre-order bonuses (e.g., for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass or Dual Pack) or through retail collaborations with stores like Best Buy, GameStop, or Micromania. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a strictly external "Key-like" consumable granted to the trainer via mystery gift or special distribution.
