## Identity & Utility
**Storage Key (Sea Mauville)** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in Gen VII data) introduced in the Generation VI Hoenn remakes and maintained in the game data of Generation VII.
* **Description:** A specific quest item used to unlock the storage hold within the Sea Mauville shipwreck (located on Route 108 in Hoenn). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale/Unique).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the locked door in the exterior-aft section of Sea Mauville, it grants the player permanent access to the Storage Hold. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a utility item for exploration and resource gathering outside of battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the key does not directly evolve Pokémon, the room it unlocks is high-value for competitive players as it contains the **Beedrillite** (Mega Stone for Beedrill) and multiple **Big Nuggets** and **Nuggets** for economy farming.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hoenn region (*Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*), it is obtained from a researcher on the deck of Sea Mauville after the player successfully navigates the Room 1, 2, 4, and 6 key-chain puzzle. In Generation VII (Alola), the item exists within the game code but cannot be obtained through normal gameplay, as Sea Mauville is not a location in the Alola region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Context:** The item represents the final stage of exploration in the Sea Mauville sub-quest, a location steeped in Hoenn lore regarding the Greater Mauville Holdings company and its industrial past.
