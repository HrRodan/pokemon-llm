## Identity & Utility
**Light Stone** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** This ancient artifact is the dormant, crystalline form of the Legendary Pokémon **Reshiram**. According to Unovan myth, Reshiram’s physical body was destroyed after the war between the twin heroes, leaving behind this stone to await a new hero who seeks "Truth." It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Light Stone serves as a narrative catalyst. In *Pokémon Black*, it is used to **summon Reshiram** for the climactic final battle against N at his castle. Once the stone resonates with the hero's desires, Reshiram awakens from its slumber to be challenged and caught by the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely as a plot device for the single-player campaign and has no mechanical function in VGC, Smogon, or casual link battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Evolution Stones (such as the Fire Stone), the Light Stone does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a **vessel for Reshiram**. In *Pokémon Black 2*, it is required to encounter Reshiram at the Dragonspiral Tower after defeating the Champion.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Pokémon Black:** Obtained from **Lenora** at the Nacrene City Museum after the player proves their worth.
    * **Pokémon Black 2:** Obtained from **N** at Victory Road after the player defeats him in the post-game at his castle.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact associated with the foundation of the Unova region.
* **Lore Context:** The Light Stone is the thematic opposite of the **Dark Stone** (which contains Zekrom). It represents the pursuit of "Truth" and will only awaken when it recognizes a "Hero of Truth." It is one of the most significant "Plot-Advancement" items in the series, as the player is forced to capture the Pokémon within it to progress the story.
