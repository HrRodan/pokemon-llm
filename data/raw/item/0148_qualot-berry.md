## Identity & Utility
**Qualot Berry** is an **Effort-drop Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable berry used primarily for fine-tuning a Pokémon's stats and emotional bond. It is a consumable item that can be used from the bag or held in battle. 
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it lowers its **Defense Effort Values (EVs)** by 10 points. Simultaneously, it increases the Pokémon's **Friendship/Happiness** (the boost magnitude—10, 5, or 2—depends on the current friendship tier). If the Pokémon's Defense EVs are already at 0, the berry will only increase friendship.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage output; generally not used for Fling strategies).
    * **Natural Gift:** When held and used via the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Poison-type** attack with **90 Power** (Gen IV+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **metagame staple** for "EV Respecing." It allows competitive players to "erase" accidental or suboptimal Defense investments to reallocate those points into more vital stats like Speed or Special Attack without needing to breed a new Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for the **"Friendship Evolution"** mechanic (e.g., Eevee to Umbreon/Espeon, Lucario, or Munchlax) as it provides a safe way to grind happiness without leveling up. It interacts with the ability **Harvest**, allowing a Pokémon to infinitely recycle the berry in long-stall battles, though its stat-dropping effect is usually the primary draw.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on **Berry Trees** (Generations VII-VIII) or grown in **Berry Patches** from a single seed. It is frequently sold at specialty Berry shops or obtained from the Berry Master in various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon** (0% encounter rate). Acquisition is strictly limited to cultivation, foraging from trees, or purchase from specific vendors. In many games, it must be cross-bred from other berries or found in mutations (e.g., X/Y Berry Fields).
