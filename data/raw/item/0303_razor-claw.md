## Identity & Utility
**Razor Claw** is a **Competitive Held Item** and **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A sharply hooked, predatory claw designed to be held by a Pokémon. It serves a dual purpose: increasing the lethality of the holder's strikes in battle and acting as a catalyst for specific biological maturation. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be purchased in specific late-game markets or battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive; typically reflects its status as a specialized combat tool or Battle Frontier reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it raises the holder’s **critical-hit ratio by one stage**. This increases the probability of landing a critical hit, which bypasses the target's defensive stat stages and screens like Reflect.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High physical damage when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A staple for "Crit-Fishing" builds. It is often paired with Pokémon possessing the **Super Luck** ability (e.g., Honchkrow, Togekiss) or moves with high crit ratios (e.g., Night Slash, Leaf Blade) to achieve a 50% or even 100% critical hit rate. It is functionally similar to the Scope Lens.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Evolution Trigger:** It is the essential requirement for evolving **Sneasel** into **Weavile**. The Sneasel must hold the Razor Claw and gain a level during the **Nighttime**. 
    * The item is consumed upon a successful evolution but remains equipped if used only for its critical-hit boost in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available at late-game Battle Towers, Battle Subways, or BP (Battle Point) shops. In some regions, it is found in craggy, mountainous environments suited for predators.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is notably rare in the wild but can be found held by members of the **Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, and Kommo-o** evolutionary line (5% chance). Trainers often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** to farm this item from these elusive Dragon-types.
