## Identity & Utility
**Starf Berry** is a **Competitive Held Item (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A rare, high-tier berry designed for use in battle. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that triggers automatically when the holder's health reaches a critical threshold. While it has a nominal cost, it is historically one of the rarest items in the franchise, often reserved as a trophy for high-level battle facility streaks.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap** to buy/sell, but typically not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **1/4 (25%) or less**, the Starf Berry is consumed to **sharply raise (by two stages)** a random stat. The stats eligible for this boost include Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, or Speed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. If used with the move Fling, the target will consume the berry and receive a sharp boost to a random stat.
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it deals **Psychic-type** damage with a high base power (100 in Gen IV-VI, 80 in Gen VII+).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **High-Variance Gimmick** item. It is most effective on Pokémon with the **Harvest** ability (like Trevenant or Exeggutor), allowing them to repeatedly cycle random +2 boosts. It is also used in "Sub-Starf" sets, where a Pokémon uses Substitute until the berry triggers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts specifically with abilities like **Gluttony** (triggers at 50% HP instead of 25%), **Ripen** (doubles the stat boost to +4), and **Unnerve/Checkmate** (prevents the berry from being eaten).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually unavailable in shops. In most titles, it is a reward for extreme performance in post-game battle facilities (e.g., reaching a 200-win streak in the Battle Tower, Battle Subway, or Battle Maison). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on any wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through special distributions, high-tier battle rewards, or Berry mutations in specific generations.
* **Lore:** Often referred to in flavor text as a "miraculous" berry, its rarity and unpredictable power make it a symbol of a master Trainer’s perseverance.
