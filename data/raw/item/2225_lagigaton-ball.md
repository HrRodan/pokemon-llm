## Identity & Utility
**Gigaton Ball** (internal ID: lagigaton-ball) is a **Specialized Poké Ball** introduced in **Pokémon Legends: Arceus** (Generation VIII).
* **Description:** As the final tier in the Heavy Ball engineering line, it is designed for heavy-duty capture at close range. It is an upgraded version of the Leaden Ball. While its weight prevents it from being thrown long distances, it features a massive catch rate multiplier when used on a Pokémon that is unaware of the player’s presence (Backstrikes).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In its debut region, it is a craftable item tied to the player's progress and rank.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Offers the highest catch rate modifier among the "Heavy" ball category in Hisui. It is specifically optimized for **stealth-based captures**. If the player successfully hits a Pokémon from behind while sneaking, the Gigaton Ball's effectiveness is drastically increased, making it the premier tool for catching Alpha Pokémon and high-level targets.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine where Fling and standard held-item mechanics are absent).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A (Non-Competitive).** Currently exclusive to *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*; it is used for overworld catching and cannot be held by Pokémon in standard VGC/Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item belongs to a specific hierarchy of Hisuian technology: **Heavy Ball < Leaden Ball < Gigaton Ball**. It requires the player to reach **Star Rank 7** in the Galaxy Expedition Team to unlock the crafting recipe.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Crafting** at workbenches or base camps. It cannot be purchased at standard General Stores.
    * **Crafting Recipe:** 1x Apricorn, 1x Iron Chunk, 1x Sky Tumblestone.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. In the Hisui region, players must gather raw materials from ore deposits and Apricorn trees to mass-produce these balls.
* **Lore Context:** The Gigaton Ball represents the pinnacle of Hisuian craftsmanship, utilizing Sky Tumblestones to handle the immense weight of the casing while maintaining the structural integrity needed to contain powerful, aggressive ancient Pokémon.
