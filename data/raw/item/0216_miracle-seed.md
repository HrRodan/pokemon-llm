## Identity & Utility
**Miracle Seed** is a **Competitive Held Item (Type-Enhancement)** introduced in Generation II (noted in this record for its Hoenn/Gen III presence).
* **Description:** A seed imbued with life force that boosts the offensive capabilities of Grass-type moves. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that provides a passive power increase during combat. Unlike Key Items, it is a standard inventory item that can be traded or sold.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the holder’s **Grass-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** While often considered a "Playthrough Staple" for early-game Grass starters, it has **niche competitive viability**. It is preferred over a *Life Orb* when a trainer wants to boost a Pokémon's primary Grass-type STAB (like Rillaboom's *Grassy Glide* or Meowscarada's *Flower Trick*) without suffering recoil damage or being locked into a single move by *Choice* items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. However, it synergizes naturally with Grass-type attackers looking to hit specific damage "checkpoints" without the downsides of more powerful items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in forest environments or gifted by NPCs early in the journey (e.g., Petalburg Woods in Hoenn). In many games, it can be purchased at specialized shops or the Battle Frontier for a low cost.
* **Wild Held Item:** It can be farmed from several wild Grass-type Pokémon. It is most commonly held by wild **Cherubi, Cherrim, Maractus, Fomantis,** and **Lurantis**. It is also notably found on the **Super Size** variants of **Pumpkaboo** and **Gourgeist**. Trainers often use the **Frisk** ability to identify the item and **Thief** or **Covet** to acquire it.
