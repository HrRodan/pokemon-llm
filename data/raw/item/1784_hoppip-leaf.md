## Identity & Utility
**Hoppip Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A raw crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Hoppip evolutionary line. It is a consumable utility item specifically designed for use at the TM Machine. As a material, it cannot be used directly in battle or overworld for healing.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Accessible). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its role as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine to craft specific TMs. Once consumed, the leaf is removed from the player's "TM Materials" inventory pocket to produce a move-teaching disc.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no direct impact on battle statistics or mechanics. Its utility is restricted to the "preparation phase" of team building (obtaining moves for the moveset).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a drop-based resource resulting from interactions with the Hoppip, Skiploom, or Jumpluff species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching wild Hoppip, Skiploom, or Jumpluff in the Paldea region or other Gen IX locales.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a "held item" in the traditional sense; rather, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop (loot) added to the inventory upon the conclusion of a battle with the **Hoppip** line. It is frequently gathered in early-game grassy areas where Hoppip are abundant.
