## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CRV4786)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It serves as a beacon to summon a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot** be purchased through standard gameplay means.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; while the internal value is low, this item is distributed via serial codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the crystal itself has no battle effect, it is used to encounter Pokémon that may possess Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or the Gigantamax Factor, which are essential for building competitive teams in the Sword & Shield era.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed as **Event Rewards** or **Pre-order Bonuses** (such as those from retail partners like GameStop or Best Buy, or bundled with the Dual Pack). They are not available through normal exploration or shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these are unique digital "keys" meant to provide players access to rare encounters that might otherwise be version-exclusive or difficult to find in standard Raid Dens.
