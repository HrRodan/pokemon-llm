## Identity & Utility
**Black Belt** is a **Type-Enhancement** held item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A thematic martial arts accessory designed to be held by a Pokémon. It aids in mental focus, specifically boosting the power of Fighting-type techniques. It is a **Holdable/Active** item that can be purchased in specific markets or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the power of the holder's **Fighting-type moves is increased by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base physical damage when thrown; no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily a **niche or playthrough staple**. In competitive settings (Smogon/VGC), it is generally outclassed by the *Choice Band* (50% boost but locks moves) or *Life Orb* (30% boost but drains HP). However, it is viable for Fighting-type attackers that require a power boost without the drawback of recoil or move-locking, such as in lower tiers or restricted item formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It interacts purely with the damage formula for Fighting-type attacks.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in locations associated with martial arts (e.g., Dojos or mountains) or sold in larger Department Stores.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature item for several Fighting-type species. It can be farmed from wild **Makuhita**, **Throh**, and **Sawk**. Trainers often use the **Thief** or **Covet** moves, or the **Pickup** ability, to acquire multiple belts for their team.
