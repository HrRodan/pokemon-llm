## Identity & Utility
**TM144 (Fire Pledge)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk* DLC).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach the move **Fire Pledge** to compatible Pokémon, primarily the Fire-type Starter Pokémon from all generations. In its debut generation for this specific ID, it is a single-use consumable that must be crafted or found.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts; it is acquired through exploration or the TM Machine crafting system using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Fire Pledge**. 
    * **Move Data:** Fire Pledge is a Special Fire-type move with 80 Power and 100% Accuracy.
    * **Combo Mechanic:** When used in the same turn as *Grass Pledge*, it creates a "Sea of Fire" on the opponent's side (dealing damage every turn). When used with *Water Pledge*, it creates a "Rainbow" on the user's side (doubling the secondary effect chances of moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 0 (This item cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily a **Doubles/VGC niche tool**. While its base power is decent, it is almost exclusively used for its "Pledge Combo" effects. In singles, it is generally outclassed by Flamethrower or Fire Blast.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-learning tool for "Starter" Pokémon (e.g., Charizard, Cinderace, Skeledirge).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy (*The Indigo Disk*). Once obtained, it can be replicated at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, crafting this TM typically requires:
    * **5,000 LP**
    * **3x Litten Fur**
    * **3x Fuecoco Scales**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. TMs are man-made technological discs and are never held by wild encounters.
