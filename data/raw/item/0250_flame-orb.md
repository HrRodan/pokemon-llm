## Identity & Utility
**Flame Orb** is a **Competitive Held Item** (Status-Inducing) introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A bizarre, glowing sphere that radiates heat. When held by a Pokémon in battle, it intentionally afflicts the holder with a Burn status. It is a holdable-active item designed for strategic self-sabotage to trigger specific abilities or moves.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate; typically restricted to specialty shops or Battle Point exchanges).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** At the end of each turn, if the holder does not already have a non-volatile status condition, the Flame Orb inflicts a **Burn**. The activation occurs after the point where burn damage would have been calculated for that specific turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Successfully using Fling will consume the item and **guarantee a Burn** on the target).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **High-Tier Competitive Staple**. It is primarily used to activate the **Guts** ability (boosting Attack by 50%), the **Marvel Scale** ability (boosting Defense by 50%), or the **Quick Feet** ability (boosting Speed). It is also the preferred method to double the base power of the move **Facade**. 
    * **Strategy Note:** In higher tiers, it is often "Tricked" onto an opponent's physical attacker to permanently cripple their Attack stat (as Burn halves physical damage for Pokémon without Guts).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is essentially useless on Fire-type Pokémon (who are immune to Burn) or Pokémon with the **Water Veil** or **Comatose** abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Rarely sold in standard Marts; usually found in post-game Battle Facilities (such as the Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, or Battle Tree) for 16–48 BP. In modern titles, it can sometimes be found at the Porto Marinada auction or the Cram-o-matic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Heatmor** (5% chance), requiring the use of moves like Thief, Covet, or the **Pickup** ability to harvest.
