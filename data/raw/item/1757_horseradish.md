## Identity & Utility
**Horseradish** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A pungent, spicy condiment used exclusively as a component in the sandwich-making mechanic during Picnics. It is a consumable ingredient that cannot be held by Pokémon in battle. 
* **Cost:** 410 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich, Horseradish contributes to the sandwich's overall **Meal Powers**. It is a key ingredient for increasing **Humungo Power** (increasing the likelihood of finding large Pokémon) and provides a significant boost to **Spicy** and **Bitter** flavor profiles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the "Preparation Phase" of gameplay. It is used by competitive players and shiny hunters to manipulate spawn rates (Encounter Power), Title rates (Title Power), or size (Humungo Power) through the Sandwich mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the Gen IX Sandwich mini-game, where its physics properties (a small, slightly rounded piece) can make it prone to falling off high-stacked sandwiches.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased from food-specific retailers in the Paldea region. It is most commonly found at **Sure Cans** branches and the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. Its availability in shops is often tied to the player's progress (number of Gym Badges earned).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, this is a processed culinary good that must be purchased or found as a sparkling overworld item in picnic-related areas.
