## Identity & Utility
**Ghost Memory** is a **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized electronic memory disc designed to be inserted into the life-support mask or drive of a specific Pokémon. It contains high-density Ghost-type data. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought, though it is typically acquired as part of a set.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the Pokémon’s **RKS System** ability activates, changing Silvally’s base type to **Ghost**. Additionally, its signature move, **Multi-Attack**, becomes a Ghost-type move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** The Ghost Memory is mandatory for utilizing "Silvally-Ghost." In competitive play (such as lower Smogon tiers), Silvally-Ghost is valued for its access to a high-base-power physical Ghost move (Multi-Attack) and its utility as a Defogger or pivot. However, because it occupies the item slot, Silvally cannot hold Leftovers or Life Orb, limiting its longevity or raw power compared to other Ghost types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **RKS System** ability. It has no effect when held by any Pokémon other than Silvally (including its pre-evolution, Type: Null).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), the Ghost Memory is obtained from **Gladion** at the Aether House or Ancient Poni Path. In later generations like Sword and Shield, it is typically given by an NPC in the Battle Tower after the player obtains a Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. These are unique, man-made items created by the Aether Foundation to stabilize the "Beast Killer" (Type: Null/Silvally).
* **World Knowledge:** The Ghost Memory is part of a 17-item set of Memories. Unlike the Plates used by Arceus, Memories historically did not provide a damage boost to their respective types in their introductory generation, serving solely to facilitate the type change.
