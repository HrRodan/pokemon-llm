## Identity & Utility
**Legend Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A stone tablet imbued with the combined power of all Pokémon types. It is a unique **Key Item / Held Item** specifically tied to the Alpha Pokémon, Arceus. It cannot be bought or sold, representing a singular artifact of divine significance.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Arceus**, it triggers a unique interaction with the move **Judgment**. Unlike standard Plates that lock Arceus into a single type, the Legend Plate allows Arceus to dynamically shift its type at the moment it uses Judgment. The move becomes a type that is **super effective** against the opponent's specific weaknesses while simultaneously changing Arceus’s own type to one that resists the opponent's incoming attacks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be thrown; it is a critical Key Item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** Currently, the Legend Plate's dynamic type-shifting mechanic is exclusive to *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*. In standard Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet) competitive play, this item is not available in the game code for ranked battles, making it a "special mechanic" item rather than a standard competitive staple.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the ability **Multitype**. It represents the ultimate form of Arceus, transcending the limitations of the 18 individual elemental plates.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained only in the post-game of *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*. The player receives it after successfully defeating **Arceus** in the final confrontation at the Temple of Sinnoh. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a one-of-a-kind reward for completing the "Seeking the Remaining Plates" and "The Deified Pokémon" missions.
* **Lore Context:** The Legend Plate is the physical manifestation of Arceus's omnipotence, proving its status as the creator of the Pokémon world by harmonizing all elements into a single vessel.
