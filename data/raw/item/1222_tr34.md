## Identity & Utility
**TR34 (Future Sight)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon the move **Future Sight**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, mirroring the mechanics of classic TMs from earlier generations. It represents a powerful Psychic-type offensive maneuver.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate cost; often traded for **Watts** in the Galar Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Future Sight**. When used in battle, the user envisions a future attack; two turns later, a blast of psychic energy (120 Base Power) strikes the target. This damage is calculated based on the user's Special Attack and the target's Special Defense at the time the move was initiated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120 (Max Power). TR34 is among the hardest-hitting items when used with the move **Fling**, though this consumes the machine.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier (Staple).** Future Sight is a cornerstone of competitive singles (Smogon OU) in Gen VIII. It is frequently used by Pokémon like Slowbro, Slowking, and Reuniclus to force "checkmate" positions where the opponent must choose between taking a massive Psychic hit or switching into a physical attacker that can be punished by the user's teammate.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It is primarily used on Psychic-type Special Attackers or high-utility "bulky" pivots.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR34 is primarily acquired by defeating Psychic-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Dens** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** throughout the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. As a manufactured machine, it is typically distributed by League-affiliated traders or found as loot from powerful Dynamax entities.
* **Lore Context:** The high cost and single-use nature of TRs compared to TMs in the Galar region suggest they are "higher-tier" or "lost" techniques that require more energy (Watts) to synthesize or stabilize.
