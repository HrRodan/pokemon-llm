## Identity & Utility
**Fighting Memory** is a **Memory** (Specialized Held Item) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized electronic memory disc designed to be inserted into a specific Pokémon's interface. It is a **Held Item** that is technically purchasable/sellable but functions as a permanent equipment piece for a specific species. It is part of a 17-item set that allows for total elemental versatility.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though typically obtained as a gift or key find).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, this item changes Silvally's type to **Fighting** via its **RKS System** ability. Additionally, it changes the type of the move **Multi-Attack** to Fighting-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (If Flung, Silvally loses its Fighting typing and Multi-Attack reverts to Normal-type for the remainder of the battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Species-Specific.** In competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), Fighting-type Silvally is used as a bulky physical attacker. While the item provides a 120 BP STAB move (Multi-Attack) with no drawback, it suffers from the "item clause" cost—Silvally cannot hold a Life Orb, Choice Band, or Focus Sash while using the Memory.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with the **RKS System** ability. It has no effect on any Pokémon other than Silvally.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most games (Sun/Moon, Sword/Shield), this item is not bought at a standard Mart. It is typically gifted to the player by an NPC (such as Gladion or an Aether Foundation researcher) upon receiving the Pokémon **Type: Null** or its evolution, **Silvally**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** Created by the Aether Foundation, the Memories were designed to replicate the "Multitype" ability of the Mythical Pokémon Arceus. The Fighting Memory specifically contains combat data that reconfigures Silvally's cellular structure to mimic the properties of Fighting-type Pokémon.
