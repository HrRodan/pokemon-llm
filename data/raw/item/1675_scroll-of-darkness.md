## Identity & Utility
**Scroll of Darkness** is a specialized **Gameplay/Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Isle of Armor DLC).
*   **Description:** A peculiar scroll that allows a specific Pokémon to undergo evolution by reading its secrets. It is a **Key Item-tier** object that cannot be sold or traded, functioning as a permanent unlock for evolution criteria rather than a standard consumable.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique quest reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When shown to **Kubfu**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Urshifu (Single Strike Style)**. This evolution changes the Pokémon’s typing to **Fighting/Dark** and grants it the signature move **Wicked Blow**.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung).
    *   **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is the sole gateway to obtaining Single Strike Urshifu, a premier physical wallbreaker in both VGC and Smogon formats known for its ability to bypass "Protect" with *Unseen Fist*.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the counterpart to the **Scroll of Waters**. Once the player chooses to interact with the Scroll of Darkness, the evolution is permanent and locks the Kubfu out of becoming the Rapid Strike Style variant.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Located at the apex of the **Tower of Darkness** on the Isle of Armor. To access it, the player must complete the "Trial of the Two Towers" by defeating five floors of trainers using only Kubfu.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, fixed-location item tied to the Galar region's legendary lore.
*   **Lore Context:** The scroll contains the forbidden or "hidden" teachings of the dark arts of combat, emphasizing a single, crushing blow that overwhelms the opponent's defenses.
