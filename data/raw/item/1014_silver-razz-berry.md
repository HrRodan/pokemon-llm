## Identity & Utility
**Silver Razz Berry** is a **Catching Bonus** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable berry used during wild encounters to soothe Pokémon and make them more susceptible to capture. It serves as the intermediate tier of the Razz Berry family, sitting between the standard Razz Berry and the rare Golden Razz Berry.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive/Premium).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a wild Pokémon during an encounter, it applies a significant multiplier to the capture rate, making the Pokémon easier to catch on the next Poke Ball throw. Unlike standard berries in the core series, this effect is consumed upon the next successful hit with a Poké Ball (or if the Pokémon breaks out).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. (Note: While it has a defined Fling power, this item primarily exists in games where the move **Fling** is not part of the standard gameplay loop).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusive to catching mechanics in *Pokémon GO* and *Pokémon: Let's Go*. It cannot be held by Pokémon in traditional VGC or Smogon competitive formats to provide any utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "field" consumable for the catching minigame.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the *Let's Go* series, Silver Razz Berries are typically found as hidden items in high-level areas like **Cerulean Cave** or awarded for achieving high-score "Catch Combos." They can also be obtained by transferring Pokémon from *Pokémon GO* via the GO Park.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense; however, in *Let's Go*, your **Partner Pokémon** (Pikachu or Eevee) may occasionally find these while traveling or by interacting with bushes.
* **Hierarchy:**
    * **Razz Berry:** Basic catch rate increase.
    * **Silver Razz Berry:** Significant catch rate increase (this item).
    * **Golden Razz Berry:** Maximum catch rate increase.
