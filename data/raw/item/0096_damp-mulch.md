## Identity & Utility
**Damp Mulch** is a specialized **Gardening Fertilizer (Mulch)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer used specifically on soft, loamy soil patches to influence Berry growth. It is a consumable field item that must be applied to the soil before planting a Berry. While highly effective in its home regions, it is noted to be incompatible with the soil mechanics of regions like Hoenn or Alola.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a soil patch, it increases the time of each growth stage by **25%**. Crucially, it also **slows down the rate at which soil dries out**, making it the ideal choice for trainers who cannot check their crops frequently.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no viability in VGC or Smogon formats as its effects are strictly limited to the overworld berry-growing mechanic. Its only utility is for resource farmers looking to stabilize rare berry yields over longer periods.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Damp Mulch does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Berry Field** mechanics found in the Sinnoh and Kalos regions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at specialized shops, such as the **Berry Master's House** on Route 208 (Sinnoh) or the **Berry Fields** (Kalos). In Generation VI, it can also be produced via the **Composter** by mixing specific colors of berries.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to NPC vendors or crafting mechanics. Its flavor text across generations highlights the regional specificity of agriculture in the Pokémon world, often rendering it a "vendor trash" item in regions like Alola where Poke Pelago replaces traditional soil farming.
