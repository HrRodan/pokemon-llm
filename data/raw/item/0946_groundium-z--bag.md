## Identity & Utility
**Groundium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (categorized as a bag item) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** It is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade a Pokémon's Ground-type moves. It is a **Held Item** that acts as a permanent key resource; it is not consumed upon use and cannot be traded or held by Pokémon outside of the Alola-based games.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique quest reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a Ground-type move, it allows the Pokémon to unleash the Z-Move **Tectonic Rage**, provided the Trainer has a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring. The power and category (Physical or Special) of the Z-Move depend on the base move used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with Fling, and they cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017-2019 and Smogon SM). It is frequently used by physical attackers like **Landorus-Therian**, **Garchomp**, and **Excadrill** to bypass defensive checks with a one-time high-damage nuke.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring** mechanic. It is unaffected by the ability *Klutz* in terms of the Z-Move activation, but the Pokémon still cannot use the move if under certain restrictive effects.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquired via the Island Challenge in the Alola region. In *Sun and Moon*, it is found at the **Vast Poni Canyon**. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is given to the player by **Hapu** after defeating her in the Poni Island Grand Trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique "Key" Held Item awarded through story progression and cannot be farmed or found on wild Pokémon.
