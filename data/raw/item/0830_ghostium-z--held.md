## Identity & Utility
**Ghostium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon that knows a Ghost-type move, it allows the user to tap into its ultimate potential through a Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Held Item** that occupies the item slot but is categorized as a unique mechanical anchor for the Alolan Z-Move system. It **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it upgrades any damaging Ghost-type move into the Z-Move **Never-Ending Nightmare**. The power of the resulting Z-Move is scaled based on the base move's original power (e.g., Shadow Ball becomes a 160 BP Never-Ending Nightmare).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are **immutable** in battle; they cannot be Flung, and the Pokémon holding them cannot be affected by **Knock Off**, **Trick**, **Switcheroo**, or **Thief**.
    * **Status Z-Moves:** If the base move is a Status move (e.g., *Will-O-Wisp* or *Destiny Bond*), using the Z-Power grants a secondary "Z-Effect" (such as boosting a specific stat) in addition to the move's normal effect. 
    * **Competitive Use:** This was a **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats (Smogon and VGC). It was famously utilized by Pokémon like **Mimikyu** and **Aegislash** to bypass defensive walls or secure "OHKOs" (One-Hit Knockouts) that would otherwise be impossible with standard moves. Ghost-type coverage is notoriously difficult to resist, making Ghostium Z one of the most dangerous offensive items in its debut generation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It requires the Trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** in their Key Items to function. It is unaffected by the ability **Klutz**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained by completing the Trial of **Acerola** at the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart on Ula'ula Island. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item that, once acquired, remains in the player's inventory as a permanent tool for any compatible Pokémon.
* **Lore context:** Z-Crystals are said to be shards of the Great Radiant One (Necrozma). Ghostium Z specifically resonates with the spectral energy prevalent in the haunted locations of the Alola region.
