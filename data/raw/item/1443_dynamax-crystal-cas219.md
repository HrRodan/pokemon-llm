## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CAS219** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (determined by the event code) to appear as a Raid Boss. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot** be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; effectively **Not for sale** as it is a promotional item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair. Once activated, a pillar of light appears at the ruins, and the player can challenge the designated Pokémon. The encounter persists until the player wins or until the end of the day (midnight).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle effect, it is a tool for **Competitive Acquisition**. These crystals were often distributed to give players early or guaranteed access to **Gigantamax-capable Pokémon** or Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities**, which are essential for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly. However, it is the primary mechanic for accessing specific "Star" Raids that are otherwise unavailable during standard Den rotations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** during promotional events. The "CAS" prefix typically denotes crystals tied to specific retail distributions (such as GameStop, Best Buy, or international equivalents) or official Pokémon movie/magazine tie-ins.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-only inventory addition.
* **World Knowledge:** Dynamax Crystal CAS219 belongs to a series of one-time-use items (like the *★And15*, *★And458*, or *★Sgr7121* crystals) that allow players to control the RNG of the Wild Area, ensuring a specific rare encounter regardless of the current weather or active Max Raid event.
