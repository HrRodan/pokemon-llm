## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cyg7417)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-specific Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized crystal that, when used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. This particular crystal remains active until the end of the calendar day it is used. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through traditional in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**; effectively not for sale as it is distributed via serial codes or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty den at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area), this item is consumed to force a **Max Raid Battle** to spawn. This allows the player to encounter a specific Pokémon (associated with the "cyg7417" event designation) regardless of weather or standard den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item serves exclusively as a bridge to an encounter and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, these crystals are tied to specific promotional encounters (often Gigantamax forms or rare hidden ability Pokémon).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** promotions. These items were typically provided as pre-order bonuses, retail partnerships (such as GameStop or CoroCoro), or through special "Wild Area News" distributions. They are not available in Poké Marts or through the Watt Traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a strictly external "Event Key" item managed via the player's inventory, though it is consumed upon use unlike traditional Key Items.
* **Context:** The "cyg" prefix in the internal name is often associated with specific Japanese promotional campaigns or retail-specific distribution identifiers within the game's code. For the player, it represents a guaranteed opportunity to capture a rare Pokémon that might otherwise be difficult to find in the Wild Area dens.
