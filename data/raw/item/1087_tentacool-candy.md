## Identity & Utility
**Tentacool Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy-booster used to strengthen members of the Tentacool evolutionary line. Unlike generic stat candies, this item is tailored to a specific species. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold but is generally acquired through gameplay loops rather than traditional mart purchases.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Tentacool** or **Tentacruel**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 point**. This contributes to the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series, allowing a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with Fling in the games where it exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is foundational for "Master Trainer" challenges and optimized playthroughs within the *Let's Go* titles. However, it has no effect in standard competitive formats (VGC or Smogon) that utilize the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly impacts the **Tentacool** evolutionary line. It is the most efficient way to maximize a Tentacruel's potential compared to using generic candies (like Tough Candy or Quick Candy) which only target single stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild **Tentacool** (especially through high **Catch Combos**) or by transferring caught Tentacool to **Professor Oak**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item. It is a reward for field research and conservation (sending Pokémon to the Professor) rather than a naturally occurring item in the wild.
* **Lore Context:** Introduced as part of the streamlined Alolan-era influence on Kanto, reflecting a system where candies represent the "essence" or "energy" of a specific species, rewarding trainers for specializing in catching and studying specific Pokémon.
