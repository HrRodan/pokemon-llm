## Identity & Utility
**Ice Memory** is a specialized **Memory** disc introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** A high-tech data disc designed specifically for the Synthetic Pokémon, Silvally. When held, it provides cryogenic data to Silvally’s RKS System, altering its cellular structure. It is a **Held Item** that is technically purchasable but is usually acquired as part of a unique set of experimental drives.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Specialty cost; though often obtained via NPC gifts rather than standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, its type changes to **Ice**. Furthermore, its signature move, **Multi-Attack**, changes its move type to **Ice** to match. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Low-Tier.** While it grants Silvally a powerful 120-base power physical Ice STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move in later generations, the Ice type is defensively poor. In formats like Smogon (NU/PU tiers) or VGC, Silvally-Ice is generally outclassed by other Ice types or more defensive Silvally forms (like Steel or Fairy), as it lacks the resistances needed to utilize its balanced base 95 stats effectively.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **RKS System** ability. It does not affect any other Pokémon, including its pre-evolution, Type: Null. If the holder's ability is suppressed (e.g., via Gastro Acid) or the item is removed (e.g., via Knock Off), Silvally reverts to its Normal-type form.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sun/Moon), the Ice Memory is obtained from **Gladion** at the Aether Paradise after the player becomes Champion. In subsequent games like Sword/Shield, it is typically handed out by an NPC in the Battle Tower alongside Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made laboratory artifact created by the Aether Foundation to replicate the "Multitype" ability of the Mythical Pokémon Arceus.
* **Lore Context:** The Ice Memory represents the successful containment of sub-zero temperatures within a digital format, allowing a synthetic creature to adapt to arctic environments instantly.
