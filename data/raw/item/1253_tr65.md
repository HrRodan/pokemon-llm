## Identity & Utility
**TR65 (Energy Ball)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Record allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Energy Ball**. Unlike the TMs of its generation, TR65 is a single-use consumable that breaks after use. It teaches a powerful Grass-type move where the user draws power from nature to fire at the target.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for Watts (3,000 W to 5,000 W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Energy Ball**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Special Grass-type move with **90 Power** and **100 Accuracy**. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling, though it consumes the record without teaching the move).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Staple Special Coverage.** Energy Ball is the gold standard for Special Grass-type damage. It is widely used in Smogon and VGC formats by non-Grass types (such as Psychic or Fairy types) to hit heavy Water, Ground, and Rock-type threats like Swampert, Gastrodon, or Tyranitar.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, particularly those with high Special Attack stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR65 is primarily obtained by defeating Grass-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (stock rotates daily). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a "manufactured" data record, typically gathered through raiding Dynamax dens or specialized trading.
