## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Atk** is a **Stat-boosting Battle Item** introduced in Generation I (noted as Generation IV in this specific data entry for Sinnoh-region context).
* **Description:** A consumable spray or supplement used exclusively during battle to enhance a Pokémon's offensive capabilities. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that can be bought at most major Poké Marts and Department Stores. It cannot be used outside of a battle encounter.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag during a battle, it raises the target Pokémon's **Special Attack** stat. 
    * *Mechanical Evolution:* While older data specifies a one-stage increase, modern iterations (from Generation VII onwards, as reflected in the Sun/Moon flavor text) **sharply boost** the stat, increasing it by **two stages** (+100%).
    * *Side Effect:* Using this item increases the Pokémon's **Happiness/Friendship** slightly (+1 point).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Essential.** X Sp. Atk is a staple for "set-up" strategies in the main story, allowing a special attacker to sweep difficult Gym Leaders or Elite Four members. It is **prohibited** in official VGC (Video Game Championships) and most standard Smogon competitive formats, which disallow the use of items from the Bag.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a temporary buff that wears off immediately if the Pokémon is switched out or the battle ends. It is effectively neutralized by the ability **Unaware** or the move **Haze**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in the mid-to-late game of almost every region. It is typically found in the **Veilstone Department Store** (Sinnoh), **Goldenrod Dept. Store** (Johto), or **Celadon Dept. Store** (Kanto).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured pharmaceutical item. It is most commonly acquired via purchase or as a hidden item found on the ground throughout the overworld.
