## Identity & Utility
**DNA Splicers (Split)** is a Key Item (functionally classified as a Forme-change tool) associated with **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** This specific state of the DNA Splicers is used to separate **Kyurem** from **Zekrom** or **Reshiram** after they have been fused into Black Kyurem or White Kyurem, respectively. It is a **Key Item** that is **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through story progression or special events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a **Black Kyurem** or **White Kyurem**, it undoes the fusion. This returns the fused Pokémon to their original forms: Kyurem and either Reshiram or Zekrom. This requires an empty slot in the player's party to accommodate the separated Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself cannot be held in battle, it is the **mechanical gatekeeper** for competitive play involving Kyurem. It allows players to toggle between Kyurem’s base form and its much more powerful fused states (Black Kyurem for physical offense/Zekrom synergy; White Kyurem for special offense/Reshiram synergy).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Instead, it facilitates **Absofusion**. It is only functional if Kyurem is already in a fused state. If Kyurem is in its base form, the item typically reverts to its "Link" state to initiate fusion.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Alola region (Gen VII), this item is typically obtained at **Aether Paradise** after the player has captured Kyurem (often via Ultra Wormholes). In its debut (Gen V), it was found in the **Giant Chasm**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, singular item tied to the legendary lore of the "Original Dragon" of the Unova region.
