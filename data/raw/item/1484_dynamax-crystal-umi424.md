## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMI424** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use mission trigger that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Placeholder cost; typically distributed via serial codes or promotional events rather than retail).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to appear in a Max Raid Battle. These encounters often feature Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), or Gigantamax potential that may otherwise be rare or version-exclusive.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Field Item).** While the item itself has no competitive battle application, it is a critical tool for competitive players to farm specific Pokémon with optimal stats or G-Max factors for use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. Its sole interaction is with the Max Raid Den mechanic in the Galar Wild Area. It is consumed immediately upon the successful initiation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event-Exclusive.** Dynamax Crystals with "UMI" designations were primarily distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, EB Games, or Target) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* expansion passes. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "Other Item" category object, often categorized alongside Key Items in terms of rarity, though it resides in the treasures/items pocket depending on the specific game version.
* **Context:** The Watchtower Lair remains inactive and empty until one of these crystals is dropped into it, making this item the unique "key" to unlocking that specific encounter point.
