## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 23** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in the Johto-based *HeartGold and SoulSilver* versions).
* **Description:** This item serves as a specialized record-keeping tool for the Pokéathlon. It specifically tracks and displays the cumulative number of times the trainer has switched Pokémon during Pokéathlon events. It is a **Key Item-style information record** that **cannot** be bought with standard currency or used in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is typically acquired via the Pokéathlon Dome's Point Exchange.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the trainer's "Pokémon Switch" count within the Pokéathlon side-game. It serves as a permanent stat-tracker for completionists and those monitoring their performance in the Pokéathlon Dome.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. It is strictly a record-keeping utility for the Pokéathlon mini-games.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution, nor does it interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is a static data object.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (located north of Goldenrod City in Johto). It is obtained by trading in Athlete Points (AP) at the Data Card shop within the Dome's underground halls.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique record card that must be earned through participation in the Pokéathlon.
* **World Knowledge Context:** Data Cards represent a "museum" of player statistics. Data Card 23 specifically focuses on the tactical aspect of switching during events, providing a historical look at the player's management of their three-Pokémon team across various trials.
