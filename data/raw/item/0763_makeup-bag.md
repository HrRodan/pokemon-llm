## Identity & Utility
**Makeup Bag** is a **Gameplay / Cosmetic Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A chic-looking case designed specifically for carrying lipsticks. It is a **Key Item** that functions as a permanent tool for character customization. It cannot be sold, traded, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; obtained via specific story progression or NPC interaction).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When accessed from the Key Items pocket, it allows the player to change their character's lipstick color at any time. This provides access to a variety of colors (such as Pink, Orange, Red, etc.) to customize the trainer’s appearance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is purely cosmetic and has no impact on Pokémon stats, breeding, or battle mechanics. It is strictly for the "fashion meta" of the Alola region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not interact with Pokémon evolution or abilities. It is tied exclusively to the player’s avatar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is provided exclusively to the **female player character**. It is typically received early in the game (often from the player's mother or after visiting a boutique in Hau'oli City) to introduce the expanded trainer customization features of the Alola region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique personal item belonging to the protagonist.
