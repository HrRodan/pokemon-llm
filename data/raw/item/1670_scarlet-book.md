## Identity & Utility
**Scarlet-Book** is a **Key Item** (classified as an event-item in data) introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet)**.
* **Description:** A chronicle of the Area Zero expedition written by the researcher Heath many years ago. It contains sketches and descriptions of the mysterious Paradox Pokémon found within the Great Crater of Paldea. As a **Key Item**, it cannot be discarded, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a narrative and progression tool. Players can read the book to gain lore insights into Paradox Pokémon (such as Great Tusk) and the history of Area Zero. In the late-game "Way Home" arc, it is utilized as a physical object to interface with the time machine/laboratory systems in Research Station #4 and the Zero Lab.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and world-building within the Paldea region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, its presence in the inventory is a prerequisite for advancing specific story beats involving **Arven** and the **AI Professor (Sada)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the main storyline of Pokémon Scarlet. It is initially carried by Arven, who eventually entrusts it to the player. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The Scarlet Book is the Scarlet-version counterpart to the Violet Book. It is famous in the Pokémon world for being dismissed as a work of "crackpot" fiction for decades due to its fantastical descriptions of prehistoric-looking monsters, which are later revealed to be real Paradox Pokémon brought to the present via a time machine.
