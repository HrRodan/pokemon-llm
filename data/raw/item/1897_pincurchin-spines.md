## Identity & Utility
**Pincurchin Spines** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item represents sharp, electrified spines shed by or harvested from Pincurchin. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any effect. While it can be sold at shops, its primary utility is as a reagent for the Technical Machine Machine (TMM).
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common Material**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a necessary ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely within the overworld economy and crafting systems of *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*. It has no impact on competitive battling metrics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its sole mechanical interaction is with the **TM Machine** interface. Based on world knowledge, it is a required component for crafting Electric-type moves, most notably **TM082 (Thunder Wave)** and **TM166 (Thunder)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop by defeating or catching wild **Pincurchin**. It is a common reward for battling Pincurchin in the beaches and coastal biomes of the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "Held Item" that provides a benefit in combat, these spines are dropped automatically into the player's inventory upon a successful encounter with a wild Pincurchin. They are often farmed by players looking to teach high-tier Electric moves to their team.
* **Lore:** These spines are known to carry a residual electric charge, reflecting Pincurchin's biology as a creature that stores electricity in its spikes to deter predators.
