## Identity & Utility
**Bonsly Tears** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item represents a biological material shed by or harvested from the Pokémon Bonsly. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be bought or sold for a marginal price, primarily used in the Technical Machine (TM) crafting system.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it has a low sell value, its primary economic worth is its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use as a reagent at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Bonsly Tears serve as a specific requirement for crafting TMs at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. They are combined with League Points (LP) and other Pokémon-specific drops to create permanent move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the item itself has no tactical value in a battle, it is essential for the competitive preparation phase, as it is required to craft powerful TMs needed for high-level move sets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Paldean crafting economy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Bonsly** or its evolution, **Sudowoodo**, in the Paldea region. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a traditional "Held Item" found via Thief or Covet. Instead, it is part of the **automatic drop system** in Generation IX, appearing in the player's inventory immediately after a successful battle with the Bonsly evolutionary line.
* **Lore Context:** Bonsly is known as the "Bonsai Pokémon" and is famous for its habit of "crying" to adjust its body's moisture levels. These "tears" are actually excess fluid being expelled, making them a thematic choice for a collectible material.
