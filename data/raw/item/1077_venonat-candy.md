## Identity & Utility
**Venonat Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy designed specifically for the Venonat evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is primarily used to enhance a Pokémon's potential through the Awakening Value (AV) system.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount, it is almost never purchased; instead, it is earned through gameplay mechanics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Venonat** or **Venomoth**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point simultaneously. This boost is applied via Awakening Values (AVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling as it does not exist in the *Let's Go* series mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* meta. In that format, maximizing AVs using species candies is essential for optimized stats, as it allows a Pokémon to bypass the traditional Effort Value (EV) limits found in other generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is only effective on members of the Venonat family; it has no effect on other species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily by catching wild Venonat or by transferring Venonat to Professor Oak. It is a reward for "farming" the specific species. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense. Instead, it is rewarded as a **Capture Bonus** when catching Venonat in the wild. Large quantities are often gathered by maintaining a "Catch Combo" of Venonat to maximize the yield of species-specific candies.
