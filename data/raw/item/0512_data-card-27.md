## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 27** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically within the *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver* Johto expansions).
* **Description:** A specialized digital record-keeper used to track specific performance metrics within the Pokéathlon. This particular card is dedicated to logging the cumulative time a trainer has spent participating in Pokéathlon events. It is a **Key Item-style record** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through specialized gameplay points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When accessed within the Pokéathlon Dome, it displays the player's total time spent actively competing in mini-games. It serves as a permanent achievement log for completionists.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the Key Items or Data Card sub-menu).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on stats, moves, or competitive battling. It is purely for "flavor" and tracking personal records in the Johto region's side activities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Pokéathlon Data Card system**, which allows players to review their mini-game history.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available at the **Athlete Shop** located within the Pokéathlon Dome (north of Goldenrod City). It is typically purchased using **Athlete Points (AP)** earned by competing in events, rather than Poké Dollars.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Pokéathlon, there are 27 different Data Cards in total. Data Card 27 represents the final "milestone" card for trainers looking to fully document their career. While the JSON lists the region as Sinnoh (due to the Gen IV engine), the Pokéathlon and this item are geographically specific to the **Johto** region.
