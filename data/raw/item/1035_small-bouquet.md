## Identity & Utility
**Small-bouquet** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** This item is a sentimental gift described as being made with "heart and soul" for a specific Trainer. It is a **Consumable/Souvenir** item that **cannot** be purchased from any standard Poke Mart.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is purely sentimental rather than economic.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Small-bouquet has **no functional effect** in or out of battle. It serves as a commemorative "Partner Gift," signifying a high bond between the Trainer and their Partner Pikachu or Partner Eevee.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard low-tier damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-viable.** It provides no statistical boosts or utility, making it useless in Smogon or VGC formats. It is strictly a collectible for the story mode.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. Its primary interaction is through the "Partner Play" mechanic, where the player's partner Pokémon occasionally finds gifts to give to the player.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is a special reward given to the player by their **Partner Pikachu** or **Partner Eevee**. It is triggered through high friendship levels and frequent interaction via the partner play menu. Unlike typical loot items (like Nuggets or Stardust), it cannot be sold for a high price, further emphasizing its role as a "keepsake."
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It is unique to the bond between the protagonist and their starter in the Kanto-revisit titles.
