## Identity & Utility
**Elixir** is a **Consumable Medicine (PP Recovery)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal spray designed to replenish the energy of a Pokémon's entire move set. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. While it has a defined internal price, it is historically **not available for purchase** in standard Poké Marts, making it a finite and valuable resource.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon, it **restores 10 PP to every move** known by that Pokémon. It is the multi-move equivalent of an *Ether*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor damage with no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Competitive.** Consumable recovery items like Elixirs are prohibited in standard VGC and Smogon formats. However, it is a **Top-Tier Utility** item for Nuzlockes, the Elite Four, and long-form dungeon crawling where PP management is critical.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a hierarchical recovery chain: *Ether < Elixir < Max Ether < Max Elixir*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally found as a hidden item or in treasure balls throughout the overworld. In many titles, it cannot be bought, though it may occasionally appear in specialized shops like the Pokémon League or through high-tier trades.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its primary renewable source in the games is typically through the **Pickup** ability, where higher-level Pokémon (such as Linoone or Ambipom) have a small percentage chance to find one after a battle.
