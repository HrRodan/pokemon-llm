## Identity & Utility
**Pidgeotite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in Generation VI (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*).
* **Description:** One of the mysterious stones required for Mega Evolution. When held by a Pidgeot and used in conjunction with a Trainer's Key Stone, it triggers a mid-battle transformation. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in traditional currency-based Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through special events, NPC gifts, or Battle Point exchanges).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pidgeot, it enables the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** during a battle. This transformation increases Pidgeot's Special Attack and Speed stats and changes its ability to **No Guard**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but the item is consumed and the ability to Mega Evolve is lost for the remainder of the encounter).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific Staple.** In tiers where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as Smogon's National Dex or Gen VII formats), this is the mandatory item for Mega Pidgeot. Its primary strategy revolves around the *No Guard* ability, ensuring that high-power, low-accuracy moves like **Hurricane** never miss.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Pidgeot. It does not affect its pre-evolutions, Pidgey or Pidgeotto. It is unaffected by most item-removal effects (like Thief or Knock Off) once the Pokémon has Mega Evolved.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a post-game reward. In its debut (ORAS), it is obtained from Shroomish hunters in Verdanturf Town after completing a specific task. In Generation VII (Sun/Moon), it was originally a serial code distribution before becoming available via the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, singular artifact categorized alongside other Mega Stones as a high-value collector's and tactical item.
