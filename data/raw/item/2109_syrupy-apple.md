## Identity & Utility
**Syrupy Apple** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** A unique, exceptionally sweet apple found in the Kitakami region. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that can be purchased from specific vendors. Unlike the Tart or Sweet Apples found in Galar, this variant is localized to the apple orchards of Kitakami.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a specific Pokémon, it triggers evolution. It is the exclusive evolution trigger for **Applin**, evolving it into **Dipplin**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no competitive utility** as a held item. Its value is strictly foundational for obtaining Dipplin (and by extension, Hydrapple), which are viable in various competitive tiers (VGC/Smogon) due to abilities like *Sticky Syrup* or *Regenerator*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item represents the third branch of the Applin evolution family. It functions similarly to the **Tart Apple** (Flapple) and **Sweet Apple** (Appletun), but is mechanically distinct and required for the Kitakami Pokédex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available for purchase at the **apple stand** located in the **Apple Hills** of Mossui Town (Kitakami). It is not typically sold in standard Pokémon Centers or Marts in Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally acquired via specialty commerce or as a ground pickup in the Kitakami region.
* **Lore Context:** The Syrupy Apple reflects the agricultural heritage of the Kitakami region, mirroring the real-world association of certain regions with high-quality fruit production. Its sweetness is so potent that it fundamentally alters the physiology of the Applin that consumes it.
