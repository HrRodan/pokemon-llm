## Identity & Utility
**Protector** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Described as an extremely stiff and heavy protective cloth. It is a single-use consumable held item designed specifically to trigger a trade-based evolution. While it can be held in battle, it provides no passive defensive or offensive bonuses to the wearer.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; often found as a rare treasure or purchased via special currency like BP in later games).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Rhydon** during a trade between players, Rhydon evolves into **Rhyperior**. The item is consumed and disappears once the evolution is complete.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. Due to its "heavy" nature, it deals significant physical damage when used with the move **Fling**, though it is generally inefficient compared to dedicated combat items.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/None. In competitive formats, the Protector has no utility. Players utilize it strictly in the "overworld" (via trading) to obtain **Rhyperior**, which is a high-tier physical tank and "Trick Room" attacker. Rhydon itself is more likely to hold an *Eviolite* in competitive play rather than its evolution item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the exclusive trigger for the Rhydon-to-Rhyperior evolutionary line. It does not interact with abilities like *Pickup* for generation in the wild according to standard data.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in late-game areas, such as **Route 228** in Sinnoh, or purchased at **Battle Frontier/Battle Maison** shops for 32 BP. In some titles, it can be found in caves or rocky terrains (e.g., Terminus Cave in Kalos or Mount Lanakila in Alola).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition usually relies on fixed overworld item balls or high-end shop exchanges. It represents the "stiff and heavy" plating that becomes Rhyperior's signature rock-like hide.
