## Identity & Utility
**Banettite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized evolutionary stone. When held by a Banette, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is permanent and cannot be consumed or lost during battle mechanics like *Knock Off* or *Thief* when held by the correct species.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique or high-value treasure typically obtained through post-game exploration or special events rather than retail purchase.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the transformation of Banette into **Mega Banette**. This transformation significantly boosts Banette's base Attack stat and replaces its standard ability with **Prankster**, which grants priority to status-category moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: While it has a high Fling power, the move *Fling* will fail if the Pokémon is capable of Mega Evolving with the stone).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Tactical Staple.** In competitive formats (like Smogon or older VGC seasons), Banettite is essential for utilizing Mega Banette's unique "Prankster Destiny Bond" or "Prankster Will-O-Wisp" utility. It transforms Banette from a fragile physical attacker into one of the most dangerous disruptive supports in the game, though it occupies the single permitted Mega Evolution slot on a team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts only with **Banette**. It does not trigger a permanent evolution; the effect is limited to the duration of a single battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Banettite is typically hidden in locations associated with death or emptiness, reflecting Banette’s Ghost-type nature. 
    * In **Pokémon X/Y**, it is found in the *Chamber of Emptiness*.
    * In **Pokémon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire**, it is located at *Mt. Pyre*.
    * In **Generation VII**, it was made available via the Battle Tree or special distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a "One-of-a-kind" artifact within the game world and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or common farming methods.
