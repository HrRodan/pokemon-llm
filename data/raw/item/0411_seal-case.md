## Identity & Utility
**Seal Case** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized storage container designed to hold various "Seals" (decorative stickers). These Seals are applied to Ball Capsules to customize the visual entrance effects of a Pokémon when released from its Poké Ball. As a Key Item, it is essential for the Ball Capsule customization mechanic and cannot be discarded or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as the inventory management system for **Seals**. It allows the player to collect, store, and organize different decorative elements (such as hearts, stars, bubbles, or flames) that are then applied to Poké Ball capsules. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Purely Cosmetic.** The Seal Case provides no statistical advantage in standard competitive battling (VGC/Smogon). However, in Generation IV, these decorations were highly relevant for **Pokémon Contests**, adding visual flair to a coordinator's performance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Ball Capsule** system. In the original Sinnoh games, certain seals could only be obtained by showing specific letter-shaped Unown to an NPC in Solaceon Town.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift from an NPC. In *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, it is given to the player by a woman in the **Solaceon Town** ruins or the house next to it after a specific interaction (often involving Unown). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind tool given to the Trainer to encourage personalization of their team.
* **Context:** The Seal Case represents a peak era of Pokémon customization. While the mechanic was a staple of the Sinnoh region, it was largely absent from subsequent generations until the release of the Gen IV remakes (*Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl*), where the system was modernized.
