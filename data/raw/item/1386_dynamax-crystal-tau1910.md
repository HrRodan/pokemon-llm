## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1910** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. It functions as a beacon to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. Once activated, the encounter remains available until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Single-Use Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; practically **Not for sale** as it is an event-exclusive distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—**Stonjourner**—to appear in a Max Raid Battle. This allows players to encounter and catch the Pokémon regardless of version exclusivity or standard weather conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** Its utility is strictly for acquisition. It allows Sword and Shield players to obtain a Stonjourner, which may be used in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as a niche physical wall or for its unique "Power Spot" ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon the start of the Raid Battle encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional bonus. Historically, "Tau" crystals were provided via serial codes through specific retail partnerships (such as GameStop or specialized pre-order bonuses) during the launch window of Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to the Galar region's "Dynamax" phenomenon and the lore of the Watchtower Ruins.
