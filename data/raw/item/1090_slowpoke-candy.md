## Identity & Utility
**Slowpoke Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic Rare Candies that increase Level, this item is part of the "Species Candy" mechanic used to permanently boost the stats of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold but is generally acquired through gameplay loops rather than traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**; however, its value lies in its scarcity and the effort required to farm it rather than its monetary price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a member of the **Slowpoke** evolutionary line, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These boosts are applied via **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a mechanic unique to the *Let's Go* series that replaced the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in the games where it exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it is exclusive to the *Let's Go* engine. Within that specific competitive meta, "Candy-maxing" a Pokémon is essential for optimized stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically restricted to the **Slowpoke family**. In the context of *Let's Go*, this applies to **Slowpoke** and **Slowbro**. It does not trigger evolution; it is strictly for stat enhancement.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching numerous Slowpoke in the wild, sending Slowpoke to Professor Oak (transferring), or by walking with a Slowpoke in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer as a **catch bonus** for maintaining a "Catch Combo" of the Slowpoke species.
* **World Knowledge:** In the *Let's Go* games, species-specific candies are the most efficient way to reach the 200 AV cap in every stat, making them superior to generic "Health" or "Mighty" candies which have level requirements and diminishing returns.
