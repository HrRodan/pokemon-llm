## Identity & Utility
**Fomantis Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A physical material dropped by members of the Fomantis evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** used primarily at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be purchased from standard Poke Marts; it is earned through gameplay interactions with wild Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common**). While it cannot be bought, this represents its sell value or its relative "weight" in the crafting economy.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" specific move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the "out-of-battle" team-building loop. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats beyond the acquisition of moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Generation IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea region** (and potentially the DLC areas of Kitakami or the Blueberry Academy). It is acquired as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Fomantis line.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop from:
    * **Fomantis**
    * **Lurantis**
* **Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, these leaves are gathered by trainers to replicate Grass-type techniques. Its inclusion in the "TM Materials" category marks it as part of the modern Pokémon crafting economy, distinguishing it from the traditional "infinite-use" or "single-use" TM systems of previous generations.
