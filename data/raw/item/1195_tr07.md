## Identity & Utility
**TR07 (Low Kick)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use teaching device used to instruct a Pokémon in the move **Low Kick**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic "consumable" mechanic for high-value moves. 
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderate cost; typically exchanged for Watts at Watt Traders in the Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Low Kick**, a Physical Fighting-type attack. The move's Base Power is dynamic, scaling based on the target's weight:
    * **< 10 kg:** 20 BP
    * **10–24.9 kg:** 40 BP
    * **25–49.9 kg:** 60 BP
    * **50–99.9 kg:** 80 BP
    * **100–199.9 kg:** 100 BP
    * **≥ 200 kg:** 120 BP
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; provides no additional effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** A staple coverage move for physical attackers. It is particularly effective in tiers with heavy Pokémon (e.g., targeting **Tyranitar**, **Heatran**, or **Snorlax**). It is often preferred over *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick* when the user cannot afford the defensive stat drops or the crash damage risk.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Not associated with any evolution triggers. It is compatible with a wide array of Fighting, Normal, and Ground-type Pokémon, as well as many bipedal species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Max Raid Battles** in the Galar region or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area. Its availability rotates daily among traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. As a "Technical Record," it represents high-density data used to simulate combat training that "breaks" the record upon a single successful upload to a Pokémon's memory.
