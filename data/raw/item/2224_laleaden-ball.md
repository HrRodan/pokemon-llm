## Identity & Utility
**Leaden Ball** (internal ID: `laleaden-ball`) is a specialized **Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** An upgraded version of the Heavy Ball specifically designed for the ancient Hisui region. It is a heavy-duty, consumable capture device that lacks aerodynamic properties, meaning it cannot be thrown over long distances. However, it compensates with a significantly increased catch rate if used on a Pokémon that has not yet detected the player (a "Backstrike"). 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In the context of the Hisui region, this item is typically crafted using raw materials or earned through Survey Corps rank progression rather than purchased through traditional currency in a modern Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a mid-tier specialized capture tool. It has a higher catch rate modifier than the standard Heavy Ball but a lower modifier than the Gigaton Ball. Its effectiveness is maximized when hitting a Pokémon from behind while it is unaware.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic and held items are absent in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
    * **Catch Mechanics:** Due to its weight, the trajectory of the throw is steeply curved. It is best used at point-blank range or while hidden in tall grass near the target.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusive to the single-player *Legends: Arceus* environment and cannot be held or used in standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a consumable item that is destroyed upon use, regardless of whether the capture is successful.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Crafting**. The recipe requires 1x Apricorn, 1x Iron Chunk, and 1x Black Tumblestone. It can also be purchased from the Jubilife Village General Store or the Ginkgo Guild after the player reaches a specific Star Member Rank within the Galaxy Expedition Team.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In the Hisui region, items are typically gathered from the environment (ore deposits and trees) rather than being stripped from wild encounters.
* **Context:** The Leaden Ball represents the industrial progression of the Hisui region's technology, sitting between the rudimentary Heavy Ball and the advanced Gigaton Ball in terms of craftsmanship.
