## Identity & Utility
**TM118 (Psychic Noise)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the move **Psychic Noise** to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted once the recipe is unlocked. It is a **Special Acquisition** item that cannot be purchased with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration and replicated using the **TM Machine** for **5,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Noise**. This is a **Psychic-type Special move** with 75 Power and 100% Accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Heal Block Utility:** The move's signature effect is preventing the target from recovering HP through moves (e.g., *Recover*, *Roost*), abilities (e.g., *Regenerator*), or held items (e.g., *Leftovers*) for two turns.
    * **Sound-Based Move:** As a sound move, it ignores the target's **Substitute** but is completely nullified by Pokémon with the **Soundproof** ability.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be utilized with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-utility **Competitive Staple** in VGC and Smogon formats. It is specifically used to dismantle "Stall" compositions and "Balance" cores by neutralizing defensive pivots like Alomomola or Amoonguss.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a key tool for Special Attackers looking to exert offensive pressure while providing utility against defensive recovery.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item on the ground in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy) during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. Once obtained, the player unlocks the ability to craft it.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM118, the player must provide:
    * **5,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Galarian Slowpoke Mucus**
    * **3x Hatterene Brush**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Materials required for crafting are gathered by defeating or catching members of the **Slowpoke (Galarian form)** and **Hatenna** evolutionary lines.
