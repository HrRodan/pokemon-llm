## Identity & Utility
**Smoke-Poke Tail** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A culinary specialty used exclusively for cooking at Pokémon Camps. The item is derived from a Slowpoke’s tail, which, according to lore, falls off naturally and regenerates quickly without harming the Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 2,200 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**). Compared to basic ingredients like sausages or pasta, this is a premium ingredient.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a key ingredient in the "Pokémon Camp" cooking mechanic to create various types of **Smoke-Poke Tail Curry**. The quality of the curry produced depends on the berries used in conjunction with this tail, resulting in restored HP, PP, and increased friendliness/experience points for the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no secondary effect when flung in battle.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. It cannot be held for a passive benefit and is purely a lifestyle/progression item for the Pokémon Sword and Shield "Curry Dex."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Unlike the "SlowpokeTail" of Gen II (which was a high-value vendor item), this version is specifically categorized for the Galar region's culinary mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Regularly sold by **Ingredient Sellers** located in the Galar Wild Area (such as those at the Entrance or in the Rolling Fields). The stock rotates daily, making it a semi-rare find for players looking to complete their Curry Dex.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon in the current metadata. Historically, Slowpoke tails were associated with Team Rocket's illegal trade in Johto; however, in Galar, they are treated as a legitimate and sustainable food source.
* **Lore Context:** This item represents a localized Galar tradition. While Team Rocket once sold tails for 1,000,000 Poké Dollars on the black market as a delicacy, the Galar region has commercialized them as a standard (albeit pricey) cooking staple, emphasizing the species' natural regenerative biology.
