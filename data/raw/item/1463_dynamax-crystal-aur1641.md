## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AUR1641** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, event-exclusive consumable used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, a specific Pokémon (associated with the AUR1641 code) will appear in the den for the remainder of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Symbolic/Cheap**). While it has a internal cost value, it is not sold in Poké Marts and is typically acquired via external distribution (such as pre-order bonuses or retail serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Stony Wilderness of the Wild Area) while carrying this item, it initiates a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the Pokémon is defeated or until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles. Its value is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of catching Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is a key tool for obtaining Pokémon that may have high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax potential, which are essential for building competitive teams in the Sword & Shield era.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a promotional bonus for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. Specifically, "AUR" prefix crystals were often linked to retail "Dual Pack" bonuses (e.g., AUR1641 and AUR1642 provided early access to Larvitar and Jangmo-o raids, allowing players to obtain version-exclusives regardless of their specific game version).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is unique to the player's inventory as a "Special Item" or "Other Item" category.
