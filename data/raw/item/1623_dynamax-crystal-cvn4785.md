## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CVN4785** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. This specific crystal (CVN4785) is tied to the encounter for **Gigantamax Corviknight**. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, it is functionally priceless as it is typically obtained via serial codes or special distributions rather than being sold in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area), they can consume this crystal to force a Max Raid Battle to spawn. The encounter is guaranteed to be a specific Pokémon—in this case, a **Gigantamax-capable Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Source-specific.** The crystal itself has no competitive battle utility. However, it was historically significant for competitive players to legally obtain a Corviknight with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which allows the use of the move **G-Max Wind Rage** (noted for clearing entry hazards and screens).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts or via standard exploration. It was distributed via **serial codes** (notably through the *CoroCoro* magazine and specific pre-order bonuses) for Pokémon Sword and Shield. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is a restricted event-only item that enters the inventory via the "Mystery Gift" or serial code entry system.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar particles or Wishing Star energy directed toward a specific coordinates-based signal (implied by the alphanumeric code "CVN4785"), summoning a powerful Dynamax or Gigantamax entity to a localized den.
