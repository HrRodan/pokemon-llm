## Identity & Utility
**Firium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically attuned to Fire-type energy. When held by a Pokémon that knows a Fire-type move, it allows the trainer to trigger a high-intensity Z-Move once per battle. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Held Item** that is **not consumed upon use** but cannot be sold or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest-related item and cannot be purchased in any Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upgrades a Pokémon's Fire-type moves into the Z-Move **Inferno Overdrive**. 
    * If the base move is an **attacking move**, Inferno Overdrive deals massive damage based on the base move's power.
    * If the base move is a **status move**, it converts into **Z-Status**, providing the move's original effect plus a secondary "Z-Power" boost (often resetting the user's lowered stats).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VII).** In the Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon metas, Firium Z was used to bypass traditional defensive checks. Common users included **Volcarona**, **Heatran**, and **Blacephalon** to guarantee a one-hit knockout (OHKO) on bulky targets that would otherwise survive a standard Fire Blast.
    * **Item Protection:** While held, this item **cannot be removed** by moves like Knock Off, stolen by Thief/Covet, or swapped via Trick/Switcheroo if the holder can utilize the crystal.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It requires the trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** to function in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for completing a Trial. In the Alola region, it is traditionally gifted to the player by **Trial Captain Kiawe** after successfully completing the trial at **Wela Volcano Park** on Akala Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard held items, Z-Crystals are unique artifacts tied to the player's progression through the Island Challenge. They are not influenced by the **Pickup** ability or farming methods.
