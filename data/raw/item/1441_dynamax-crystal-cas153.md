## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CAS153)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed for use within the Galar Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that is technically priced in the data but is not available through standard Poke Mart NPC vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Symbolic; primarily distributed via external codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area) causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, the species associated with the **CAS153** serial—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The raid persists until the end of the calendar day (midnight).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no direct application in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be brought into battle. Its value lies entirely in the **Pre-Battle Meta**, allowing players to encounter rare species, Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, or guaranteed high-IV counts for breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "key-like" consumable that is removed from the bag upon successful activation at the designated Raid Den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event-Exclusive** distribution. Historically, Dynamax Crystals with the "CAS" prefix were distributed via serial codes through retailers (like GameStop or Target), pre-order bonuses, or promotional tie-ins (such as the Pokémon Sword and Shield Expansion Pass or movie tickets).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a reward or promotional item intended to facilitate unique cooperative multiplayer encounters (Max Raid Battles).
