## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal HER6117** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. When used, it triggers a Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a internal price value, it is not sold in Poké Marts; this low cost is typically a placeholder for items distributed via serial codes or special promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the Watchtower Lair (an inactive raid den in the Watchtower Ruins), the player can use this crystal to force a specific **Max Raid Battle** to spawn. For this specific ID (HER6117), the encounter is a **Copperajah**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld mechanic of initiating a Raid. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess Hidden Abilities or high Individual Values (IVs), making the *result* of the item's use relevant for competitive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not evolve any Pokémon or trigger any held-item abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a **Promotional Serial Code**. Historically, specific Dynamax Crystals like this one were given out via retail partnerships (such as GameStop or specialized pre-order bonuses) to allow players early or guaranteed access to specific Gigantamax-capable Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is strictly a special distribution item and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief** mechanic.
* **Lore Context:** Unlike Wishing Pieces, which attract random Pokémon to active Dens, Dynamax Crystals are "tuned" to specific Pokémon signals, allowing a trainer to summon a precise species to the otherwise desolate Watchtower Lair.
