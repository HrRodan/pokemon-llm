## Identity & Utility
**Key to Room 4** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in the Hoenn remakes (Generation VI) and present in the data for subsequent generations like Generation VII.
* **Description:** A specialized facility key specifically designed to unlock a locked door within the **Sea Mauville** (the decommissioned research facility in Hoenn). It is a **Key Item** that is non-consumable and cannot be discarded, traded, or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is purely progression-based.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When in the player's possession, it grants access to **Room 4** in the interior of Sea Mauville. Unlocking this room is a prerequisite for advancing the facility's sub-quest and obtaining further items (such as other keys or the Storage Key).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld exploration and narrative progression. It provides no tactical advantage in trainer battles or VGC environments.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities. It functions exclusively as a physical lock-and-key mechanic within the game's environment.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the **Sea Mauville** facility. Typically, the player must locate this key (often hidden in trash cans or given by NPCs) as part of a "sequential unlocking" puzzle that characterizes the Sea Mauville exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind quest item.
* **Lore Context:** Sea Mauville is a site steeped in Hoenn lore, representing the failures of the Greater Mauville Holdings. Room 4 contains environmental storytelling elements (such as letters or discarded items) that flesh out the history of the workers and the facility’s eventual shutdown. In *Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire*, Room 4 is part of the chain required to eventually encounter the legendary Pokémon **Ho-Oh** or **Lugia** (depending on the version).
