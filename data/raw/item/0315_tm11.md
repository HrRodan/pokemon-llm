## Identity & Utility
**TM11** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation I** (historically teaching *BubbleBeam*) and established from **Generation II onwards** as the teaching mechanism for **Sunny Day**.
* **Description:** A device used to teach a compatible Pokémon a permanent move. In its most prominent form, it teaches the move **Sunny Day**, which alters the battlefield weather to "Harsh Sunlight" for five turns. It is a **Consumable** (in older generations) or **Reusable** (Generations V–VIII) machine that can be purchased in various regions.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sunny Day**. When used in battle, this move intensifies the sun for 5 turns (8 turns if the user holds a **Heat Rock**). 
    * **Sunlight Effects:** Fire-type move damage increases by 50%; Water-type move damage decreases by 50%; **Solar Beam/Blade** charges instantly; **Thunder** and **Hurricane** accuracy drops to 50%; **Synthesis/Moonlight/Morning Sun** recovery increases.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs typically cannot be thrown in battle, or have 0 power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility (Niche/Core).** This TM is the backbone for "Sun Teams." While often replaced by Pokémon with the **Drought** ability (like Torkoal or Groudon), TM11 is essential for manual weather setting to override opposing Rain, Sand, or Hail/Snow strategies in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with abilities such as **Chlorophyll** (doubles Speed), **Solar Power** (boosts Sp. Atk, drains HP), **Leaf Guard** (prevents status), and **Protosynthesis** (boosts highest stat).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at major **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove) or found in volcanic/sunny routes. In *Pokemon Scarlet & Violet*, it is craftable at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. As a machine, it is a human-made technological tool.
* **Historical Note:** In Generation I (*Red/Blue/Yellow*), TM11 taught **BubbleBeam**, a Water-type move. Since Generation II, it has been synonymous with the Fire-support move **Sunny Day**, representing a total shift in the item's tactical identity.
