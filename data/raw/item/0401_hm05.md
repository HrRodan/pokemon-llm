## Identity & Utility
**HM05** is a **Hidden Machine (HM)** introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** This is a permanent-use technical machine used to teach a Pokémon a specific "Hidden Move" that provides both combat utility and overworld navigation capabilities. Unlike TMs in early generations, HMs are not consumed upon use and are considered Key Items essential for story progression.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through specific NPC interactions or exploration).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. The specific move contained within HM05 has changed significantly across the franchise's history:
    * **Flash (Gens I–III):** Lowers the target's accuracy. In the overworld, it illuminates dark caves.
    * **Defog (Gen IV - Diamond/Pearl/Platinum):** Lowers the target's evasiveness and removes hazards (Spikes, Stealth Rock) and screens. In the overworld, it clears thick fog.
    * **Whirlpool (Gen IV - HeartGold/SoulSilver):** Traps the opponent for 4-5 turns. In the overworld, it allows the player to cross whirlpools.
    * **Waterfall (Gen V–VI):** A physical Water-type attack with a 20% flinch chance. In the overworld, it allows the player to scale waterfalls.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (HMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Defog (Gen IV):** A top-tier competitive staple in Smogon formats for hazard removal.
        * **Waterfall (Gen V–VI):** The gold standard physical Water-type move for Pokémon like Gyarados, Azumarill, and Feraligatr.
        * **Flash/Whirlpool:** Generally considered niche or "filler" moves in high-level competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Cannot be used on Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability in battle, but can still be taught. In older generations, moves taught via HM05 could not be forgotten unless the player visited the **Move Deleter** NPC.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** HM05 is always a milestone reward. For example, in Hoenn (Gen III), it is found in the **Granite Cave** (Flash), while in Sinnoh (Gen IV), it is obtained in **Oreburgh Gate** (Defog) or **Victory Road** (Waterfall).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique item typically guarded by NPCs or tucked away in environmental puzzles to ensure the player is prepared for the next stage of their journey.
* **Legacy:** As of Generation VII, HMs were phased out in favor of the Poké Ride system and Secret Techniques to remove the "HM Slave" requirement (carrying a Pokémon solely to use utility moves).
