## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (per936)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-specific item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at a specific location. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (encoded in this instance as per936) to appear as a Dynamax boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this is a nominal internal value as the item is typically distributed via serial codes or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Ruins of Watchtower in the Galar Wild Area), the player can use this crystal to activate a red pillar of light. This guarantees a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon regardless of the current den rotation or weather.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is entirely focused on the acquisition of specific Pokémon, often those that are version-exclusive or rare (e.g., Larvitar or Jangmo-o for Sword/Shield pre-order bonuses), which can then be trained for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it facilitates the capture of Pokémon that may have Hidden Abilities or high IVs common to Max Raid Battles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are **Promotional Distributions.** They were historically distributed via serial codes provided by retailers (like Pokémon Center, Target, or GameStop) or as bonuses for purchasing the Sword & Shield Dual Pack or Expansion Pass. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a digital "key" used to unlock a specific encounter within the Galar region's power spots.
