## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Boo5733** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, event-exclusive item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle encounter at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It is a single-use consumable that is typically distributed via serial codes rather than standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic/Cheap; however, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is generally only obtainable through promotional distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone ruin located in the East Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it causes a **Gigantamax Corviknight** Max Raid Battle to activate. The raid remains active until the player either defeats the Pokémon or until midnight on the day the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This is a utility/encounter item used solely to acquire a Pokémon. However, the resulting Gigantamax Corviknight is highly relevant in competitive VGC and Smogon formats due to its Mirror Armor ability and G-Max Wind Rage move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanics in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (★Boo5733) was a promotional item distributed via **Serial Code**. In most regions, it was provided as a pre-order bonus or through retail partnerships (such as CoroCoro in Japan or specific retailers in the West) to give players early access to Gigantamax Corviknight.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. This is a strictly event-based acquisition, though the Pokémon it summons can be farmed for rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs) once the raid is initiated.
