## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (crv4757)** is a **Special Event Consumable** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item functions as a "Raid Key" for the Watchtower Lair located in the Wild Area of the Galar region. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Not for sale**). This low cost is a placeholder value; the item is primarily distributed via serial codes during promotional events rather than through the in-game economy.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins), the crystal is consumed to spawn a powerful Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon. This allows players to challenge a specific Raid boss outside of the standard Den rotation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** While the item itself has no competitive application, the Pokémon caught through these crystals often possess **Hidden Abilities**, high individual values (IVs), or the **Gigantamax Factor**, all of which are critical for building VGC (Video Game Championships) or Smogon-tier competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** These crystals are specific to the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic. They do not trigger evolutions, but they are often the only way to encounter specific Version-Exclusive Pokémon in the opposite game (e.g., Larvitar in Pokémon Sword or Jangmo-o in Pokémon Shield).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These items are **Event-Exclusive**. They are typically distributed through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or GAME) or via serial codes in publications like CoroCoro. The specific ID `crv4757` corresponds to a unique distribution code for a specific Galar encounter.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild species; they are strictly digital distribution items designed to drive community engagement and physical store traffic.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces which attract random Pokémon to a den, these crystals are "tuned" to a specific Pokémon's frequency, guaranteeing a predetermined encounter.
