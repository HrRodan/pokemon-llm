## Identity & Utility
**Doduo Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with species-specific energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used exclusively on members of the Doduo evolutionary line (Doduo and Dodrio) to bolster their growth. Unlike standard vitamins, this item is tailored to a single evolutionary family.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal value, its primary worth is found in the time investment required to farm it rather than its retail price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Doduo or Dodrio, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 Awakening Value (AV)**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with Fling in the titles where it appears).
    * **Competitive Use:** Within the context of *Let's Go* competitive formats, Doduo Candy is essential for "unrestricted" or "standard" rulesets where **Awakening Values** are permitted. It allows a Dodrio to reach its maximum stat potential, significantly increasing its bulk and damage output beyond what is possible in traditional RPG growth. It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats (Gens 1–9).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the traditional "Level 100" cap for stat growth by utilizing the AV system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through the **Catch Combo** mechanic; catching multiple Doduo in succession increases the likelihood of receiving this candy. It is also rewarded for transferring Doduo to **Professor Oak** or walking a Doduo/Dodrio using the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is generated as a reward for the player's proficiency in catching or managing the specific species. In the ecosystem of the Kanto region (LGPE version), it represents the concentrated essence of the Bird Pokémon's vitality.
