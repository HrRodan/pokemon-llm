## Identity & Utility
**Fairium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is the inventory representation of the Z-Power crystal required to utilize Fairy-type Z-Moves. It functions as a specialized Key Item that allows the trainer to equip their Pokémon with the Fairium Z held item.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a **Fairy-type attacking move**, this crystal upgrades the move to the Z-Move **Twinkle Tackle**. The power of the resulting Z-Move is scaled based on the base power of the original move. If the base move is a status move, it becomes **Z-Status**, providing additional stat boosts (e.g., Z-Geomancy or Z-Moonlight).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** Cannot be Flung. Z-Crystals are protected from being removed, stolen, or traded during battle via moves like Knock Off, Thief, or Trick.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Generation VII Specific).** In the Sun/Moon era, Fairium Z was a staple on offensive Fairy types like Mimikyu, Tapu Lele, and Magearna to provide a high-damage nuke that ignores accuracy checks and bypasses the damage reduction of moves like Protect (dealing 25% chip damage).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard items, this cannot be held by a Pokémon with the ability **Klutz**. It does not trigger any specific evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is obtained from **Mina**, the Trial Captain of Poni Island, after meeting her in Vast Poni Canyon (though she does not have a formal trial in the original games). In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is awarded after completing Mina's Trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact granted to trainers who have proven their worth in the Alolan Island Challenge.
* **Lore context:** Z-Crystals are manifestations of Necrozma's light, refined into shards that resonate with the bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon to unleash ultimate techniques.
