## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Peg8450** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Upon activation, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use "Key/Consumable" hybrid that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; primarily obtained via external promotional distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the stone pillar in the Watchtower Ruins (Wild Area), it summons a specific Gigantamax Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Corviknight**—for a Max Raid Battle. Regardless of the outcome of the battle, the crystal is consumed upon the raid's initiation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A as a held item. However, it is high-value for competitive preparation, as it guarantees an encounter with a Pokémon possessing the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was a requirement for specific VGC (Video Game Championships) formats before the Max Soup mechanic was introduced in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via special serial codes, often through retail partnerships (such as CoroCoro in Japan or specific pre-order bonuses). It is not available for purchase at Poke Marts or found through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. This is an "Event-only" acquisition, making it a rare collector's item or a tool for specialized hunting. It bypasses the standard "Wishing Piece" RNG (Random Number Generation) by forcing a specific, high-tier encounter.
