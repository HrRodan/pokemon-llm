## Identity & Utility
**Murkrow Bauble** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specific material dropped by members of the Murkrow evolutionary line. As a part of the TM Material classification, it is a consumable resource specifically designed for use at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a consumable item that can be sold, but not bought at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily serves as a low-value sellable or a high-value crafting component).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a crafting ingredient required to create specific Technical Machines (TMs). Once used at a TM Machine, the bauble is consumed along with League Points (LP) to generate a permanent-use TM.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly an out-of-battle resource for move-pool customization. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats beyond the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is intrinsically linked to the Murkrow and Honchkrow lines. It does not interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional sense, though it is dropped regardless of how the wild Pokémon is defeated (manual battle or Let's Go mode).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Murkrow** or **Honchkrow**. It is most commonly farmed in the various provinces of the **Paldea** region where Murkrow are nocturnal staples.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not a "held item" in the traditional sense; rather, it is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Murkrow line. It is a physical manifestation of the bird Pokémon's habit of collecting small, shiny objects (baubles).
