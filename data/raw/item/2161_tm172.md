## Identity & Utility
**TM172 (Roar)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** It is a teaching tool used to impart the move **Roar** to a compatible Pokémon. In the current generation, TMs are single-use consumables that must be crafted or found. As a "Machine" item, it cannot be held by Pokémon for in-battle effects but is a vital resource for move-pool expansion.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In Generation IX, it is acquired via the TM Machine system using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials rather than a standard shop price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Roar**. When used in battle, Roar forces the target to switch out for a random member of the opponent's party. In wild encounters, it causes the wild Pokémon to flee, ending the battle immediately.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Priority:** Roar has a **-6 priority bracket**, meaning it almost always moves last in a turn.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility (Phazing).** Roar is a staple in competitive singles (Smogon) and niche in VGC. It is primarily used for "Phazing" (pseudo-hazing) to:
        1. Force out a "setup sweeper" that has accumulated stat boosts (e.g., Swords Dance or Calm Mind).
        2. Rack up "chip damage" by forcing opponents to switch through entry hazards like **Stealth Rock**, **Spikes**, and **Toxic Spikes**.
        3. Reveal the opponent's bench early in a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is ineffective against Pokémon with the **Soundproof** ability or those behind a **Substitute** (prior to Gen 6) or under the effect of **Ingrain** or **Suction Cups**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM172 is exclusively available in the **Scarlet and Violet** expansion content. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground in the **Kitakami** region or the **Terarium**. 
* **Crafting Recipe:** Once unlocked, it can be manufactured at any Pokémon Center TM Machine using:
    * **400 LP** (League Points)
    * **3× Houndour Fang**
    * **3× Yungoos Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be crafted or discovered as a localized overworld item.
