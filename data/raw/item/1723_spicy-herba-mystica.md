## Identity & Utility
**Spicy Herba Mystica** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A legendary, extremely rare condiment said to provide instant vitality. In gameplay, it serves as a high-tier crafting material for the Sandwich minigame, specifically used to trigger the most powerful "Meal Powers" available. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that **cannot** be bought.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a priceless treasure that must be earned through high-level challenges.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as an ingredient in a sandwich, it drastically boosts the potency of Meal Powers. Most notably, combining Spicy Herba Mystica with other Herba Mystica variants allows the player to obtain **Sparkling Power Lv. 3**, **Title Power Lv. 3**, and **Humungo Power Lv. 3**. The "Spicy" variant is specifically associated with increasing the **Humungo Power** (size) of encountered Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While it cannot be used in a Pokémon battle, it is the "Gold Standard" for competitive players and collectors to hunt for **Shiny Pokémon** and Pokémon with specific **Marks** (via Sparkling and Title Power).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the **Picnic/Sandwich mechanics** exclusive to the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in shops. It is a rare reward dropped exclusively by **5-star and 6-star Tera Raid Battles**. Certain Pokémon (such as Amoonguss, Blissey, and Cetitan) have a higher statistical probability of dropping multiple Herba Mystica.
* **Story Role:** In the *Path of Legends* storyline of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, Herba Mystica are the legendary herbs guarded by **Titan Pokémon**. The Spicy variant is specifically guarded by the **Lurking Steel Titan (Orthworm)**. While the story versions are used to heal Koraidon/Miraidon, the versions found in Raids are used by the player for sandwich crafting.
