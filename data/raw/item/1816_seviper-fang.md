## Identity & Utility
**Seviper Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by wild Seviper. In the Paldea region, these materials are processed at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. It is a **Consumable** crafting ingredient that **Cannot be bought** at traditional Poke Marts, though it has a modest sell value.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard Material value; used primarily for LP conversion or crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific crafting component at the **TM Machine**. It is combined with League Points (LP) and other materials to manufacture specific TMs (Technical Machines).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the 'Materials' pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it provides no stat boosts or tactical effects in combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the Gen IX crafting system, specifically for moves associated with Seviper’s biological traits (typically Poison-type moves like **TM045 Venoshock**).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop in the Paldea region (and other Gen IX areas) after defeating or catching a wild Seviper.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "Held Item" that can be stolen with *Thief* or *Covet*, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Seviper**. 
* **Lore Context:** The fangs of a Seviper are notoriously sharp and venom-drenched. In the context of modern Pokémon technology, scientists have figured out how to extract the "essence" of a Pokémon's natural abilities from these physical remnants to teach moves to other compatible Pokémon.
