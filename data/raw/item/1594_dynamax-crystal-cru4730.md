## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CRU4730)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, a specific Pokémon—designated by the crystal's internal ID—will appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be used in battle.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but functionally **Special Acquisition** as these items are typically distributed via Serial Codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (Ruins of Watchtower) in the Wild Area, it activates a Max Raid den. This allows the player to challenge a specific Pokémon (such as a Gigantamax form or a version-exclusive) that would not normally be present.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no competitive utility, it is a gateway to obtaining Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors which are essential for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are event-exclusive items. Historically, "CRU" series crystals were distributed through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or GAME) via serial codes provided to players who purchased specific bundles or visited during promotional windows.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "Event Item" that resides in the Other Items pocket of the Bag.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated clusters of Galar Particles that can force a "Wishing Star" type reaction at a specific dormant Power Spot (the Watchtower Lair), bypassing the need for natural Max Raid spawns.
