## Identity & Utility
**TM35 (Flamethrower)** is a **Machine** item that has primarily taught the move Flamethrower since Generation III. 
* **Description:** This Technical Machine allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the Fire-type move Flamethrower. While the move associated with TM35 has shifted historically (teaching Metronome in Gen I and Sleep Talk in Gen II), it is most widely recognized as the definitive source for Flamethrower. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** teaching tool (depending on the specific game generation) that is generally available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flamethrower** to a compatible Pokémon. Flamethrower is a Special Fire-type attack with high power (90 or 95 depending on the generation) and 100% accuracy. It has a 10% chance to inflict a **Burn** on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Flamethrower is the gold standard for reliable Fire-type coverage. It is favored in both VGC and Smogon formats over Fire Blast for its perfect accuracy and over Heat Wave for its consistency in single battles. It is essential for Special Attackers like Charizard, Arcanine, and many non-Fire types (like Nidoking or Hydreigon) for coverage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited by a Pokémon's move-learning compatibility; most Fire-types and many Dragon, Normal, and Ground-type "powerhouse" Pokémon can learn it.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, TM35 is often a high-tier prize or late-game purchase. In early generations (R/S/E, FRLG), it was famously obtained at the **Mauville City or Celadon City Game Corner** for a high volume of coins. In modern titles, it is found in late-game areas or crafted via the TM Machine (Scarlet/Violet) using materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically a fixed-location item or shop exclusive, reflecting its high utility and value in a trainer's arsenal. Unlike some items gathered via **Pickup**, TMs must usually be sought out at specific milestones.
