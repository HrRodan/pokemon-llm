## Identity & Utility
**Scyther Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutritional supplement packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically to the Scyther evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is technically purchasable but primarily earned through gameplay mechanics.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its value lies in the effort of acquisition rather than its monetary price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a member of the Scyther family (Scyther or Scizor), it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 point. This is managed through the **Awakening Value (AV)** system, which replaces Effort Values (EVs) in the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** It is a mandatory requirement for maximizing a Pokémon's potential in *Let's Go* competitive formats. However, it has no utility in standard core-series competitive play (VGC/Smogon) as the AV system does not exist in those titles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted to the **Scyther evolutionary line**. While it does not trigger evolution, it is the most efficient way to maximize the "stats" of a Scyther or Scizor compared to using generic stat candies (like Quick Candy or Mighty Candy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not found in standard Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired by catching Scyther in the wild—specifically by building **Catch Combos**—or by transferring caught Scyther to **Professor Oak**, who rewards the trainer with species-specific candy.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a reward for the trainer's proficiency in catching and managing the Scyther species. It represents the "essence" or specialized nutrition required for this specific line to reach its peak physical condition.
