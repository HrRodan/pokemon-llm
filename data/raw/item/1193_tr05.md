## Identity & Utility
**TR05 (Ice Beam)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon the move **Ice Beam**. Unlike traditional Technical Machines (TMs) in the Galar region which are infinite-use, Technical Records (TRs) are **consumable** and break after a single application. It is widely considered one of the most valuable offensive teaching tools in the game.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Ice Beam** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Ice Beam is a Special Ice-type move with **90 Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It has a 10% chance to inflict the **Freeze** status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the record, making it a very inefficient use of resources.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High / Essential.** Ice Beam is a cornerstone move in competitive formats (VGC and Smogon). It provides vital "BoltBeam" coverage (Electric + Ice) and is the premier choice for Special Attackers to check high-tier threats like Landorus-T, Garchomp, and Dragonite.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. As a Technical Record, it is subject to the **Recycle** move or the **Pickup** ability in certain game contexts, though primarily it is a static resource.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Pokémon Sword and Shield, TR05 is most commonly acquired through **Max Raid Battles** involving Ice-type Pokémon. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (usually 3,000 - 5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically distributed as a reward for Raid excellence or through specialized Galar-region commerce.
