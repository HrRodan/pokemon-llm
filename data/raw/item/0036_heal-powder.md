## Identity & Utility
**Heal Powder** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A bitter, herbal medicinal powder used to treat ailments. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. It functions as a budget-friendly alternative to the Full Heal, though its extreme bitterness has negative social consequences for the Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly cures a Pokémon of any primary status ailment (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep). 
* **Friendship Penalty:** Unlike standardized medicine, this herbal remedy is "bitter." Using it decreases the target Pokémon's Happiness/Friendship by **5 points** (if friendship is below 200) or **10 points** (if friendship is 200 or higher).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides a basic physical hit with no additional status effect when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Specialty.** It is rarely seen in competitive formats as **Lum Berries** provide status curing without consuming a turn or lowering friendship. In the main story or **Nuzlocke challenges**, it is a highly cost-effective way to stock up on status heals before the mid-game, provided the trainer does not rely on the move **Return**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly discourages high-friendship evolutions (e.g., Eevee to Sylveon/Espeon/Umbrella, or Lucario). Conversely, it could historically be used to maximize the power of the move **Frustration** by keeping a Pokémon’s happiness at zero.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually unavailable in standard Poké Marts. It is primarily sold at specialized **Herb Shops** located in specific regions (e.g., Lavaridge Town in Hoenn, Eterna City in Sinnoh, or Driftveil City in Unova). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a processed herbal product rather than a naturally occurring resource. It is often used by trainers who prefer traditional "natural" remedies over modern Silph Co. or Devon Corp. technology.
