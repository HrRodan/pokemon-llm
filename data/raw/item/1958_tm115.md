## Identity & Utility
**TM115** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This TM teaches the move **Dragon Pulse**, a powerful and reliable Special Dragon-type attack. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use items that can be crafted repeatedly at any TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using the TM Machine economy rather than purchased at standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Pulse** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Dragon Pulse is a Special move with **85 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It deals damage with no additional secondary effects, making it a highly consistent offensive option.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** Dragon Pulse is a staple for Special Attackers that require Dragon-type coverage without the stat-dropping drawback of *Draco Meteor*. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like **Hydreigon, Goodra, and Dragapult** in both VGC (Regulated Doubles) and Smogon formats. In Nuzlocke runs, it serves as a crucial mid-to-late game power spike for Dragon-types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "All-Machines" category, allowing it to be stored in the TM Case.

## Acquisition & Lore

    * **Crafting:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at a TM Machine for **8,000 LP**, **3x Goomy Mucus**, and **3x Tatsugiri Scales**.
    * **Location:** Typically found as a collectible item in the overworld of the Paldea region or the Terarium (Blueberry Academy) in *The Indigo Disk* DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. The materials required for its creation are farmed from wild **Goomy**, **Sliggoo**, **Goodra**, and **Tatsugiri**.
