## Identity & Utility
**Master Ball** is a **Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation I** (though noted here in its Generation III data context).
* **Description:** Regarded as the pinnacle of capture technology, the Master Ball is the most effective Poké Ball ever created. It is a **Consumable** battle item that **cannot be bought** in any standard Poké Mart. It is designed to capture any wild Pokémon instantly, regardless of its health, status, or catch rate.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is effectively priceless, often treated as a "Key Item" in terms of rarity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during a wild Pokémon encounter, it provides a **100% guaranteed catch rate**. It bypasses all capture mechanics, including the Pokémon's remaining HP, status conditions, and the species' base catch rate.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling to deal damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** Not used in VGC or Smogon competitive formats as it has no utility in Trainer-vs-Trainer battles. If used in a trainer battle, the ball is wasted and the turn is lost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. However, it is the only ball capable of reliably capturing "Roaming" Legendary Pokémon (like Entei or Latios) or high-stakes Shiny encounters that may possess self-fainting moves (like Self-Destruct or Teleport).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Extremely limited. Typically, only one is provided per playthrough, usually gifted by a high-ranking NPC (such as the President of Silph Co. or a Professor) after defeating an antagonist organization. In later games, it can rarely be obtained as a grand prize in the Pokémon ID Lottery or through high-tier Max Raid Dens.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability, making it one of the few non-renewable resources in a standard playthrough.
