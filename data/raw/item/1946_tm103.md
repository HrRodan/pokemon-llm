## Identity & Utility
**TM103 (Substitute)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX** (Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide a Pokémon with the move **Substitute**. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumables, but they can be replicated indefinitely using the TM Machine. It is a **Consumable Machine** that cannot be bought with traditional currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In the Paldea region, it requires **3,000 League Points (LP)** and specific Pokémon materials (3x Falinks Sweat, 3x Kecleon Scales, 3x Azurill Fur) to craft.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently teaches the move **Substitute** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Logic:** The user sacrifices 25% of its maximum HP to create a decoy. This substitute takes damage in place of the user and grants immunity to most status moves (e.g., *Thunder Wave*, *Toxic*) and secondary effects of damaging moves until the substitute's HP is depleted.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Substitute is one of the most strategically significant moves in competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). it is used to scout enemy switches, protect "glass cannon" sweepers, and enable strategies like "SubSeed" (Substitute + Leech Seed) or activating low-HP berries (e.g., Salac or Liechi Berry).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a cornerstone for Pokémon with the ability **Poison Heal** (like Gliscor) or those utilizing the **Focus Punch** combo.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Scarlet/Violet:** Found as a physical item in the overworld (notably in the East Province Area Two) or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine after defeating specific Team Star bases or finding the TM in the wild.
    * **The Indigo Disk:** Available via the Blueberry Academy TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required for crafting are gathered by defeating wild **Falinks**, **Kecleon**, and **Azurill** (often farmed efficiently using the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature).
