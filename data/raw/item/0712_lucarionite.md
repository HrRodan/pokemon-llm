## Identity & Utility
**Lucarionite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized evolutionary stone. When held by a Lucario, it reacts with a Trainer's Mega Bracelet/Mega Ring to trigger Mega Evolution during combat. It is a **Held Battle Item** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically acquired as a gift or through specialized endgame points like BP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a **Lucario**, it allows the Pokémon to transform into **Mega Lucario** during its turn in battle. This transformation significantly boosts its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats, and changes its ability to **Adaptability**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: In most battle formats, Mega Stones cannot be removed from their holder by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, and *Fling* will typically fail if the user is the correct species for the stone).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Smogon Ubers/National Dex, VGC 14-19), Lucarionite is essential for Lucario. The transition to Mega Lucario turns it into a premier "glass cannon" sweeper, leveraging the *Adaptability* boost to STAB moves like Close Combat and Meteor Mash.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard evolution stones, this is not consumed upon use. It specifically interacts with Lucario; if held by any other Pokémon, it provides no benefit.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via significant story milestones or high-level challenges. In its debut (Pokémon X/Y), it is famously gifted to the player by the Gym Leader **Korrina** at the Tower of Mastery after the player proves their bond with Lucario. In later generations (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), it is purchased at the **Battle Tree**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon**. It is a unique artifact typically limited to one per playthrough.
