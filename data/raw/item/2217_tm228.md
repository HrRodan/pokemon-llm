## Identity & Utility
**TM228 (Psychic Noise)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
*   **Description:** A single-use device (consumable) used to teach a Pokémon the move **Psychic Noise**. In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy region, TMs are integrated into the TM Machine crafting system. While the move is powerful, the disc itself is a standard data-storage medium for combat techniques.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the context of Generation IX, it is acquired through exploration or crafted using **3,000 LP**, **3 Hattenna Dust**, and **3 Slowpoke Claws**.

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Noise** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    *   **Move Stats:** Psychic-type, Special Attack, 75 Base Power, 100% Accuracy.
    *   **Secondary Effect:** This move inflicts the **Heal Block** status on the target for two turns, preventing them from using any HP-recovery moves (e.g., Recover, Roost, Soft-Boiled) or receiving healing from abilities and items (e.g., Regeneration, Leftovers).
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard for Generation IX TMs; they cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **Highly Strategic.** Psychic Noise is a meta-defining utility move in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is used to "hard-counter" stall teams and defensive walls by dealing respectable damage while simultaneously stripping the opponent of their ability to sustain themselves.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible primarily with Psychic-type Pokémon and sound-based learners (e.g., Hatterene line, Slowking, Skeledirge).

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Specifically found within the **Terarium** of the Blueberry Academy. It is often discovered as a TM pickup (yellow Poké Ball item) in the **Coastal Biome** or rewarded after defeating specific trainers in the DLC questline.
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. Its components (Hattenna Dust and Slowpoke Claws) must be farmed from wild **Hattenna** and **Slowpoke** respectively to craft additional copies.
*   **Context:** Unlike earlier generations where Psychic moves focused on raw power or stat reduction, TM228 represents a modern shift toward utility-based disruption, flavored as a sound-based psychic assault.
