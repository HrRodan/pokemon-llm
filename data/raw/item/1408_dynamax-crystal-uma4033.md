## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA4033** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** A rare, event-exclusive consumable used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. Once inserted into the lair, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific, predetermined Pokémon. This effect persists until the end of the day (midnight). It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Technical Value / Not for sale**). While the internal data assigns a nominal value, these items are functionally priceless and obtainable only via external distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch sub-region of the Wild Area), it creates a red beam of light, initiating a **Max Raid Battle**. This allows the player to encounter a specific Pokémon—often one that is rare, possesses a Hidden Ability, or is capable of Gigantamaxing—without the need for a Wishing Piece.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in Ranked Battles or VGC. Its value is strictly for the acquisition of rare Pokémon for a player's collection or competitive breeding stock.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid den. It bypasses the standard "Daily Reset" of dens, allowing for a guaranteed encounter once the item is in the player's inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Distribution Only.** Dynamax Crystals with "UMA" or numerical designations are typically distributed via **Serial Codes** provided during retail collaborations (such as with GameStop, EB Games, or Target) or as pre-order bonuses for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* expansions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is an artificial/specialized item specifically tied to the Galar region's Power Spot phenomena and is never gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
