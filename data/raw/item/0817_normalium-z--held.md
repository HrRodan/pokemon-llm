## Identity & Utility
**Normalium Z (Held)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically tuned to Normal-type energy. When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Normal-type move, it allows the trainer to trigger a Z-Move once per battle. As a Z-Crystal, it is a permanent held item that cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, nor can it be consumed.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired as a unique plot/key item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upgrades Normal-type moves into enhanced versions:
    * **Offensive Moves:** Converts damage-dealing Normal moves into **Breakneck Blitz**. The base power of the Z-Move scales with the power of the original move.
    * **Status Moves:** Adds a "Z-Power" secondary effect to the move. For example, *Z-Conversion* boosts all of the user's stats by one stage, while *Z-Belly Drum* restores the user's HP before deducting the cost.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move *Fling*).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility (Generation VII Staple).** In its debut generation, Normalium Z was a cornerstone of several competitive strategies. It is most famously used by **Porygon-Z** (to utilize *Z-Conversion*) and **Eevee** (as a component for *Extreme Evoboost*), as well as being a versatile "nuke" to bypass defensive walls in Smogon and VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It requires the Trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** to function in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, this is the first Z-Crystal the player typically acquires. It is obtained after completing the trial of **Captain Ilima** in Verdant Cavern on Melemele Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be farmed. It is a unique item tied to the player's progress through the Island Challenge. 
* **Lore context:** It represents the harmony between the Trainer, the Pokémon, and the natural energy of the Alola region. Unlike Mega Stones, Z-Crystals like Normalium Z draw upon the "internal potential" of the Pokémon's existing movepool.
