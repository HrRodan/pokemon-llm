## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ERI897)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A special, single-use consumable item that activates a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, the triggered raid remains active until the end of the day. It is a specialized event item that cannot be used in standard battle scenarios.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominally cheap, but essentially a placeholder value as the item is primarily distributed via external promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone structure in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Centiskorch**—to appear as a Dynamax boss. This allows players to challenge a specific species regardless of the standard raid den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate rare Pokémon acquisition, often used for hunting Hidden Abilities (HA) or Gigantamax forms.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, these crystals were frequently used to distribute Gigantamax-capable species that were otherwise difficult to find in the early game.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These items are not found in Poké Marts or through standard exploration. They are typically distributed via **Mystery Gift Serial Codes** associated with real-world promotions, such as retail store events (e.g., GameStop, GAME) or magazine inserts (e.g., CoroCoro).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it is strictly an event-exclusive trigger.
* **Location Context:** The **Watchtower Lair** is the exclusive site for these crystals. Located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area, it serves as a dedicated "spawn point" for event-based Max Raid Battles.
