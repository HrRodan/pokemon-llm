## Identity & Utility
**Buginium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Bug-type move, it allows the trainer to trigger a powerful Z-Move once per battle. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **permanent held item** that cannot be consumed, traded, or removed in battle by moves like Knock Off or Thief.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; it is a unique story-related acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upgrades a Pokémon's Bug-type moves into enhanced Z-Moves. 
    * **Damage-Dealing Moves:** Converts the move into **Savage Spin-Out**. The base power of the Z-Move depends on the power of the original move (e.g., Megahorn results in a higher BP than Bug Bite).
    * **Status Moves:** Converts the move into a **Z-Status Move**, providing the original effect plus a unique Z-Power boost (e.g., Z-Tail Glow restores the user's HP to full before applying the Special Attack boost).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed from the holder by any means.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **high-impact niche staple** in the Generation VII competitive meta. It is frequently used to bypass defensive walls. Common users include **Volcarona** (to power through Fire-resistant threats) and **Buzzwole** or **Pheromosa** for massive physical breakthroughs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is immune to moves like Embargo or Magic Room and cannot be intercepted by the ability Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the Buginium Z is obtained in **Shady House** (Po Town) after defeating Team Skull Boss Guzma or finding it in a chest within his room. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that remains in the player's inventory across the Alola journey.
* **World Context:** Unlike Mega Stones, Z-Crystals represent the "bond" between Trainer and Pokémon, specifically tuned to the elemental energy of the Bug type.
