## Identity & Utility
**TM137 (Grassy Terrain)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that imparts the move **Grassy Terrain** to compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX ecosystem (Scarlet/Violet and The Indigo Disk), TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **3,000 LP** and materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Grassy Terrain**. When used in battle, this move creates a verdant battlefield for five turns (eight if the user holds a Terrain Extender). 
    * **Heal:** Grounded Pokémon recover 1/16th of their max HP at the end of each turn.
    * **Damage Boost:** The power of Grass-type moves used by grounded Pokémon is increased by 30%.
    * **Damage Reduction:** The power of the moves *Earthquake*, *Magnitude*, and *Bulldoze* is halved against grounded targets.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in the current generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Strategic Value.** While the Ability *Grassy Surge* (often found on Rillaboom) is the preferred way to set this terrain, TM137 is used on defensive or utility Pokémon to manual-reset terrain in "Terrain Wars" to overwrite Electric, Psychic, or Misty Terrains. It is a staple in specific VGC (Doubles) compositions to provide passive recovery and boost the priority move *Grassy Glide*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Interacts specifically with the Ability **Grass Pelt** (boosts Defense) and the move **Grassy Glide** (grants +1 priority while terrain is active).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available in the **Paldea Region** and the **Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk)**. It must be crafted at the TM Machine using the following ingredients:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Sunflora Leaf**
    * **3x Flabébé Pollen**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial construct. However, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Sunflora** and the **Flabébé** evolutionary line, often found in flowery biomes.
