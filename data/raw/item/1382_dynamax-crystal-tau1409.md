## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1409** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-specific consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized crystalline shard that emits a signal to attract a specific Giant Pokémon. It is used exclusively at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone ruin in the Galar Wild Area). Once activated, a pillar of light appears, allowing the player to initiate a Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). Note: While the internal cost is low, the item is technically "Priceless" as it is only obtainable via external distribution (Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it forces a Max Raid Battle to spawn. This specific crystal (Tau1409) is programmed to summon **Gigantamax Corviknight**. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate the capture of a competitive-ready Pokémon, but the item itself has no tactical application in PvP or PvE combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use to trigger the "Gigantamax" phenomenon encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was traditionally distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail promotions (such as those from GameStop or EB Games) or as a pre-order bonus for the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Expansion Pass. It is not available in any Pokémon Mart or via the Armorite/Dynite Ore traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar particles. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which attract random Pokémon to any Power Spot, these numbered "Tau" crystals act as a beacon for a specific, predetermined species—in this case, the Flying/Steel-type G-Max Corviknight.
