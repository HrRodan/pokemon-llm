## Identity & Utility
**Mech-Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a distinctive Magnemite print. It is a consumable messaging item designed to be held by a Pokémon to facilitate communication between Trainers during trades. It can be bought at various Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer can compose a message from a structured list of words and phrases and give it to a Pokémon to hold. The recipient can read the message and choose to either store it in their PC or erase it to make the item reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically, Mail served a niche defensive purpose in competitive play. Because a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot have its item removed or swapped**, it provides a natural immunity to moves like **Trick**, **Switcheroo**, **Thief**, and **Covet**. 
    * **PC Lock:** A Pokémon holding Mech-Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system; it must be in the active party until the Mail is removed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is immune to the effects of item-manipulation abilities or moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in Poké Marts in the Hoenn and Kanto (FRLG) regions, typically appearing in larger hubs like Mauville City. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or traded from another player.
* **Lore context:** Part of a series of collectible Mail items from the Game Boy Advance era, designed to add personality to the social aspect of Pokémon trading before the advent of more advanced global communication systems.
