## Identity & Utility
**Gimmighoul Coin** is a **TM Material / Evolution Resource** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A small, golden coin lost by a Gimmighoul. While categorized in system data as a "TM Material," it serves as a unique, stackable collection requirement for evolution. It is a **Consumable Resource** that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 800 Poké Dollars (Mid-range value; primarily sold at the Porto Marinada auction or to vendors when in excess).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Evolution Catalyst. If the player has **999 Gimmighoul Coins** in their inventory, a Gimmighoul (Chest Form or Roaming Form) will consume all 999 coins to evolve into **Gholdengo** the next time it levels up.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the coin itself has no battle utility, it is the exclusive gatekeeper to **Gholdengo**, a **Competitive Staple** in VGC and Smogon formats due to its "Good as Gold" ability and high Special Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is unique in that it requires a massive quantity (999) rather than a single use. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional battle sense, as it resides in the TM Materials/Treasures pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed throughout the Paldea region. They are primarily acquired by interacting with **Roaming Form Gimmighoul** (yielding 1–5 coins) or defeating/catching **Chest Form Gimmighoul** (yielding 30–777 coins). Small amounts can also be found as sparkling pickups or rewarded by NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, these coins are guaranteed drops from wild **Gimmighoul**. They are essential for trainers looking to complete the Pokédex or build a competitive Gholdengo.
* **Lore:** These coins are said to contain the essence of the Gimmighoul's greed and energy. The 999-coin requirement is a tribute to Gholdengo’s Pokédex number (#1000), representing the 999 coins plus the Gimmighoul itself.
