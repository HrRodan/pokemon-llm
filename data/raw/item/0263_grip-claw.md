## Identity & Utility
**Grip Claw** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that ensures its multi-turn, "trapping" attacks (like Bind, Wrap, or Whirlpool) persist for their maximum possible duration. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought for a moderate price in various regional shops and specialized boutiques.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard cost for tactical held items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held, it extends the duration of multi-turn trapping moves. Specifically, it forces moves that usually last 4–5 turns to last for a guaranteed **7 turns** (in modern generations) or a fixed **5 turns** (in its debut generation). This prevents the opponent from switching out for a significantly longer period.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). While the item has no secondary Fling effect, a power of 90 makes it a viable high-damage projectile in a pinch.
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **Niche Tactical Item**. It is occasionally seen on "stall-breaker" sets or trapping sets using moves like *Infestation*, *Magma Storm* (Heatran), or *Fire Spin*. By forcing a trap to last 7 turns, the user can maximize passive chip damage or set up safely while the opponent is unable to switch.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is often used by Pokémon with the **Ability: Merciless** or those that rely on chip damage, though it competes for a slot with the *Binding Band* (which increases the damage of the trap rather than the duration).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in Department Stores (like Veilstone or Goldenrod) or specialized Battle Frontier/Subway shops. In recent regions, it is often available at Delibird Presents locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature item found in the wild on clawed Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Sandshrew**, **Sandslash**, **Sneasel**, and **Weavile** (including their **Alolan variants**). These are commonly gathered using the **Thief** move or the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets.
