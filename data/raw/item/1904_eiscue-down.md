## Identity & Utility
**Eiscue Down** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of downy feathers dropped by the Penguin Pokémon, Eiscue. It is a consumable crafting material that cannot be used directly from the bag; instead, it is utilized at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars/League Points (Cheap/Common resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). Once collected, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket and consumed when the player selects a compatible move to teach their Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly. Its value lies in the "Preparation Phase" of competitive play, allowing players to craft essential TMs to optimize Pokémon movesets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a drop item unique to the Eiscue line and is required for crafting specific moves that fit Eiscue's thematic profile (typically Ice-type or physical utility moves like **TM034 Icy Wind** or **TM143 Blizzard**).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching wild **Eiscue**. In the Paldea region, Eiscue is a **Version Exclusive** found only in **Pokémon Violet**, typically appearing in the northern icy waters and coastal areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a **guaranteed drop** upon victory. In Pokémon Scarlet, players must obtain this material by participating in Eiscue Tera Raid Battles or by receiving an Eiscue via trade and then utilizing it in the Picnic/Auto-Battle mechanics to farm the material.
