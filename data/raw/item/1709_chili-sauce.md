## Identity & Utility
**Chili Sauce** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A spicy condiment used exclusively within the Picnic mechanic of *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*. It serves as a seasoning component to craft sandwiches that grant various Meal Powers to the player. It is a **Consumable** item that is easily purchasable in bulk.
* **Cost:** 320 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich recipe, Chili Sauce contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. It specifically provides points toward **Humungo Power**, **Exp. Power**, and **Raid Power**. It is frequently associated with boosting these stats for **Grass-type**, **Fire-type**, and **Poison-type** Pokémon depending on the combined ingredients.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** (Battle-wise). However, it is strategically significant in the "meta-game" of Pokémon training for increasing the frequency of Tera Raid rewards or accelerating experience gain through sandwich buffs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component for the Sandwich system and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at culinary retail outlets across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Sure Cans** once the player has obtained a specific number of Gym Badges (usually available from the start of the game).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or traditional held items, this is a processed culinary good obtainable only through commercial vendors or as a reward from NPCs at picnic sites.
