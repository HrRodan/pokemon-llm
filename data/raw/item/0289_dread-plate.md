## Identity & Utility
**Dread Plate** is a **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A stone tablet inscribed with ancient power. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that serves a dual purpose: it functions as a type-specific power booster for any Pokémon and a form-change catalyst for the Mythical Pokémon Arceus. While it has a listed cost, it is typically treated as a rare collectible or a key find in the field.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Specialty item; rarely sold in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the power of the holder's **Dark-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Arceus Interaction:** If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (specifically Arceus), the holder’s primary type changes to **Dark**. Additionally, the move **Judgment** becomes Dark-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when used with the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used to facilitate **Arceus-Dark** in Uber tiers. For non-Arceus Pokémon, it is generally considered niche, as items like *Black Glasses* provide the same boost without being tied to the "Plate" sub-category, though the Dread Plate is viable if multiple Dark-boosters are needed on a team (Item Clause permitting).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not a trigger for evolution but is essential for maintaining Arceus's Dark-type form.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found through exploration or special mechanics. In its debut region (Sinnoh), it is often discovered in the **Grand Underground** or hidden in locations like the Old Chateau. In later generations, it is often found in seafloor ruins or provided by NPCs who reward the player for catching Arceus.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is a unique artifact of the Pokémon world, part of a set of 18 plates said to be fragments of the "Original One's" power used to shape the universe.
* **Attributes:** Its `underground` attribute signifies its recurring role as a rare treasure found via mining minigames in various regions.
