## Identity & Utility
**TM138 (Psychic Terrain)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced as this specific number in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that imparts the move **Psychic Terrain** to compatible Pokémon. In the current generation, TMs are single-use items that can be crafted repeatedly using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration or crafting using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Terrain**. When used in battle, this move creates a terrain that lasts for five turns (eight if the user holds a Terrain Extender). 
    * **Grounded Pokémon** are protected from moves with increased priority (e.g., Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, Fake Out).
    * **Psychic-type moves** used by grounded Pokémon receive a **30% power boost**.
    * It enables the secondary effect of the move **Expanding Force**, doubling its power and allowing it to hit both opponents in Double Battles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Strategic Value.** Psychic Terrain is a cornerstone of "Psyspam" archetypes, often paired with Pokémon like **Indeedee-F** (who has the Psychic Surge ability) or used manually to overwrite opposing terrains (like Rillaboom's Grassy Terrain) and shut down priority-heavy attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used by Psychic-type Pokémon and certain supportive Fairy or Normal types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Paldea/Blueberry Academy:** Can be found as a collectible item in the overworld or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine.
    * **Crafting Recipe:** Typically requires **3,000 LP**, **3x Slowpoke Claw**, **3x Indeedee Fur**, and **3x Drowzee Fur** (standard materials for this specific move in Gen IX).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. TMs are strictly man-made utility items in the Pokémon world lore, representing digitized move data.
