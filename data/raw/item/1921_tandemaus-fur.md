## Identity & Utility
**Tandemaus Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Tandemaus line. It is a consumable resource used primarily at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a non-holdable, non-usable item in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars/League Points (Cheap/Common resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a recipe ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players must combine League Points (LP) with specific materials like Tandemaus Fur to "print" TMs. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy to provide Pokémon with new moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it bears the name of the "Couple Pokémon," it does not trigger the evolution of Tandemaus into Maushold (which occurs via leveling up to 25+). It is strictly a currency for the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild **Tandemaus** or **Maushold** upon being defeated or captured. It can also be found as shimmering pickups on the ground in regions where Tandemaus habitats are concentrated, such as the areas surrounding Artazon, Zapapico, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is awarded automatically as a "loot" drop following a successful encounter. Because Tandemaus often appears in groups, players can quickly accumulate this material for crafting.
