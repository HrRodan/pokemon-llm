## Identity & Utility
**Pecha-berry** is a Medicine (Berry) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A sweet-flavored, pink berry used to neutralize toxins. It is a consumable, holdable item that can be used both in battle (automatically) and from the bag (manually). It is highly accessible and serves as the standard early-game cure for the Poison status.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly cures the **Poison** or **Badly Poisoned (Toxic)** status condition. When held by a Pokémon, it is consumed immediately upon the holder becoming poisoned.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (If used with the move Fling, the target is hit and their poison status is cured).
    * **Natural Gift:** Under World Knowledge mechanics, it acts as an **Electric-type** move with 80 Power (Gen VI+) when used with the move Natural Gift.
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche**. In serious competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), it is almost entirely outclassed by the **Lum Berry**, which cures all status conditions. However, it is a staple in playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges to mitigate the risk of Toxic or Poison Point during early-to-mid-game encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Interacts with the **Harvest** ability, allowing a Pokémon to potentially regain the berry after consumption. 
    * Triggers the **Cheek Pouch** ability, restoring HP in addition to curing poison.
    * Use is blocked by the **Unnerve** ability or the move **Magic Room**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available via Berry Trees, the Berry Master, or specialized shops. It is one of the most common berries in the Pokémon world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently held by wild Pokémon (21 species total), most notably early-route species like **Wurmple**, **Poochyena**, **Venipede**, **Yungoos**, and **Alolan Rattata**. It is a common drop for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at lower level tiers.
