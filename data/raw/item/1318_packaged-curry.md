## Identity & Utility
**Packaged Curry** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A pre-prepared food item used exclusively within the **Pokémon Camp** cooking mechanic. According to its flavor text, it is designed for convenience, ensuring "no slipups" during the cooking process. It is a **Consumable** ingredient that is primarily used to complete the Curry Dex.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range**). While more expensive than basic berries, it is priced reasonably for a specialized cooking component.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as the main ingredient in Pokémon Camp, it produces **Instant Curry**. Depending on the Berries added alongside it, the quality can range from Koffing Class to Charizard Class, restoring HP, PP, and increasing Pokémon friendliness/experience.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held in competitive formats (VGC or Smogon) and provides no tactical advantage in battle. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld "Pokémon Camp" feature.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts solely with the **Curry Dex** system in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Using it allows players to register entry #14: Instant Curry.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased from **Ingredient Sellers** found throughout the **Wild Area**, the Isle of Armor, and the Crown Tundra. The inventory of these NPCs rotates daily, making the item semi-common but not always guaranteed to be in stock.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is a processed human food item, emphasizing the Galar region's culture surrounding curry and camping. It is generally acquired through currency exchange rather than foraging or the **Pickup** ability.
