## Identity & Utility
**S.S. Ticket** is a **plot-advancement** (Key Item) introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A specialty boarding pass required for maritime travel. It is a permanent Key Item that serves as a gatekeeper for ferry services between cities and regions. It cannot be sold, tossed, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; obtained via story events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to board specific ferry ships. Its function varies slightly by region:
    * **Hoenn (RSE/ORAS):** Used to board the **S.S. Tidal** to travel between Slateport City, Lilycove City, and the Battle Frontier.
    * **Kanto (FRLG):** Used to board the **S.S. Anne** in Vermilion City.
    * **Johto/Kanto (HGSS):** Used to board the **S.S. Aqua** to travel between Olivine City and Vermilion City.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. It is strictly a utility item for overworld progression and post-game exploration.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It is a "Plot Advancement" tool used to unlock new map areas (like the Battle Frontier or secondary regions).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The S.S. Ticket is usually gifted to the player by a major NPC after achieving a specific milestone:
    * In **Hoenn**, it is typically received from Norman (the player's father) or Mr. Briney after the player enters the Hall of Fame.
    * In **Kanto**, it is provided by Bill at his Sea Cottage as a reward for helping him.
    * In **Johto**, it is given by Professor Elm after the player defeats the Elite Four, allowing travel to the Kanto region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, character-bound item that cannot be farmed or traded.
