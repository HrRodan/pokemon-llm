## Identity & Utility
**Heart Scale** is a **Collectible** exchange item formally categorized within the Sinnoh region (**Generation IV**).
* **Description:** A rare, heart-shaped scale that glows with rainbow colors. It functions as a specialized currency rather than a standard consumable or held item. It **cannot** be used directly from the bag to produce an effect but is instead traded to specific NPCs (Move Relearners).
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its value lies in its utility rather than its resale price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as payment for the **Move Relearner** (found in locations like Pastoria City or Blackthorn City). In exchange for one Heart Scale, a Pokémon can be taught any move it has previously "forgotten" or passed the level requirement for, including "Level 1" moves or moves skipped while at a Day Care.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no in-battle effect, it is a **mandatory utility item** for competitive play. It is the primary method for accessing "Egg Moves" that have been deleted or "Level 0" moves essential for certain builds (e.g., teaching *Icicle Spear* to Cloyster).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with NPC tutors.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found on beaches or via the **Sinnoh Underground** mining mechanic. In many regions, it is a reward for showing specific Pokémon to NPCs or participating in mini-games.
* **Wild Held Item:** The most reliable method of farming Heart Scales is by catching or using the move *Thief* on wild **Luvdisc**, which frequently carry the item. 
* **Farming Context:** Experienced trainers often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase hold item rates) and the **Pickup** ability to accumulate these scales for mid-to-late game team optimization.
