## Identity & Utility
**Scizorite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed specifically for the Scizor evolutionary line. When held by a Scizor, it acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** via standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Mega Stones are typically unique items obtained through exploration, post-game challenges, or specific NPC gifts rather than retail purchase.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Scizor, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** to become **Mega Scizor**. This transformation increases its base stat total (notably boosting Attack, Defense, and Special Defense) and usually retains or optimizes the **Technician** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High). However, flinging a Mega Stone is generally detrimental as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the match.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Mega Scizor is a premier "Bulky Offense" threat in competitive formats (like Smogon's OU or Gen 6/7 VGC). The Scizorite turns Scizor into a formidable tank with access to priority (Bullet Punch) and pivoting (U-turn), making this item mandatory for any team utilizing Mega Scizor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically triggers the temporary Mega Evolution of **Scizor**. It does not affect Scyther or Kleavor. It is unaffected by item-removing moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by the correct species (Scizor).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized locations. In *Pokémon X & Y*, it is found in the Frost Cavern; in *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*, it is located in Petalburg Woods; in *Sun & Moon*, it is purchasable at the Battle Tree for BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that must be discovered by the Trainer. Because it cannot be found on wild encounters, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**.
