## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Phe338** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, it causes a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal ID) to appear in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Promotional Acquisition**; technically has a nominal sell value, but is not commercially available).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it generates a unique Max Raid Battle beam. This allows players to encounter a specific Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used solely for capturing Pokémon or farming Raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, and Dynamax Ore).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is strictly used to interact with the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic introduced in Sword & Shield. It is a "single-use" trigger; the raid remains active only until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **special promotions**, serial codes (often through retailers like GameStop or Best Buy), or as bonuses for purchasing specific Pokémon products (such as the Pokémon Sword & Shield Expansion Pass or special movie tickets). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended for the player's inventory to facilitate specific Galar region encounters.
* **Context:** The "phe" prefix in the internal name often denotes a **Pokémon Home Event** or a specific promotional distribution sequence (e.g., crystals distributed for Pokémon like Centiskorch, Sandaconda, or Copperajah).
