* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** TM Materials are strictly for the crafting sub-menu and do not influence competitive battle stats or strategy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Poochyena line.

* **Lore Context:** Introduced as part of the crafting mechanics in the *Hidden Treasure of Area Zero* DLC, representing the sharp fangs of the Bite Pokémon. It is typically required for crafting TMs that involve biting or physical Dark-type maneuvers (e.g., Crunch or Psychic Fangs).
