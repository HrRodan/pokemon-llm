## Identity & Utility
**Ability Shield** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon. This protective charm shields the holder’s Ability, ensuring it cannot be changed or suppressed by the moves or Abilities of other Pokémon. It is a **Held Item** that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon's Ability is protected from external interference. It prevents the holder's Ability from being changed (e.g., via *Skill Swap*, *Entrainment*, *Worry Seed*, or *Doodle*) and from being suppressed (e.g., via *Gastro Acid*, *Core Enforcer*, or the Ability *Neutralizing Gas*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Utility Niche.** In competitive VGC and Smogon formats, it is a specialized counter-meta item. It is most frequently used on Pokémon whose viability depends entirely on their Ability (such as **Dondozo** with *Unaware* or **Gholdengo** with *Good as Gold*) to protect them from *Neutralizing Gas* Weezing or *Mold Breaker* users.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike many held items, the Ability Shield specifically interacts with "Ability-negating" mechanics. It allows the holder to bypass the effects of *Mold Breaker*, *Teravolt*, and *Turboblaze*, which would normally ignore the holder's defensive Abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, it is primarily available for purchase at **Delibird Presents** shops (specifically the Mesagoza branch) after the player has made sufficient progress in the Gym challenge. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by any wild Pokémon. It is considered a piece of advanced technology/equipment rather than a natural resource, making it unavailable via the **Pickup** ability.
