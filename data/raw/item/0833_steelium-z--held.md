## Identity & Utility
**Steelium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola Region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. It serves as a specialized held item that upgrades a Pokémon's Steel-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold** in shops.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Story/Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Steel-type move, it allows the use of the Steel-type Z-Move: **Corkscrew Crash**. 
    * If the base move is a **Physical or Special** attack, Corkscrew Crash deals massive damage based on the power of the original move.
    * If the base move is a **Status** move, it creates a **Z-Status** move, adding secondary effects (such as boosting stats) in addition to the move's normal function.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-tier competitive staple in Generation VII formats (Smogon and VGC 2017–2019). It is frequently used by offensive threats like **Kartana**, **Metagross**, or **Heatran** to secure a one-time "nuke" to breakthrough defensive walls.
    * **Immunity:** Z-Crystals are unique in that they **cannot** be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief* or *Covet*, or traded via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It requires the trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** to activate.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is obtained from **Molayne** at the Hokulani Observatory after the player completes Sophocles's trial. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is received after defeating the Totem Pokémon at the same location.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique item gifted to the player during their Island Challenge journey.
