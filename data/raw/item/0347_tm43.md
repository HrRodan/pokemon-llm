## Identity & Utility
**TM43 (Technical Machine 43)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation III** (though the TM index exists across all generations).
* **Description:** A technical machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. As a TM, its behavior varies by generation: it was single-use in Generations I–IV, became infinite-use in Generations V–VII, and returned to a craftable/single-use format in Generation IX.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. The specific move contained in TM43 has shifted significantly throughout the series:
    * **Gen V – IX:** Teaches **Flame Charge** (Fire-type, Physical, 50 BP). It deals damage and provides a guaranteed +1 Speed boost.
    * **Gen III – IV:** Teaches **Secret Power** (Normal-type, Physical, 70 BP). Its secondary effect (e.g., Paralysis, Sleep) changes based on the terrain.
    * **Gen II:** Teaches **Detect** (Fighting-type, Status). Protects the user from attacks for one turn.
    * **Gen I:** Teaches **Sky Attack** (Flying-type, Physical, 140 BP). Requires a turn to charge.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Flame Charge (Modern):** A competitive staple for physical sweepers (e.g., Blaziken, Darmanitan) to boost Speed while maintaining offensive pressure.
        * **Secret Power (Classic):** Used in Gen III/IV Hoenn and Sinnoh primarily for the **Secret Base** mechanic, allowing players to create homes in trees, bushes, or cave walls.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to Pokémon with compatible movepools.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Generation III (Hoenn)**, it is notably obtained from an NPC on Route 111, which introduces the player to the Secret Base mechanic. 
    * In **Generation VI (Kalos)**, it is sold at the Lumiose City Poké Mart.
    * In **Generation IX (Paldea)**, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Torkoal Soot and Fletchling Feathers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is typically found as a field item (Poké Ball on the ground) or purchased from specialized vendors.
