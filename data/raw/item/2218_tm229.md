## Identity & Utility
**TM229 (Hard Press)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that imparts the move **Hard Press** to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires crafting materials).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hard Press**, a Physical Steel-type attack. The move's power is calculated based on the target's remaining HP: the higher the target's current HP relative to its maximum, the greater the damage dealt (Max Base Power: 100).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in this generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Tactical.** Hard Press serves as a reliable Steel-type coverage option for physical attackers that lack access to *Iron Head* or *Meteor Mash*. It is particularly effective as an opening move against healthy Fairy, Ice, or Rock-type threats to maximize damage output.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be reproduced infinitely provided the player has the necessary crafting materials (e.g., Revaroom Wheels and Orthworm Tarnish).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy or obtained as a reward for Biome-related tasks. Once obtained, it is registered in the **TM Machine** for crafting.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Its availability is tied strictly to exploration in the Unova-linked Blueberry Academy or the TM crafting system.
