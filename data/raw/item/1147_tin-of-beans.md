## Identity & Utility
**Tin of Beans** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** One of the various specialized food items used for cooking at a Pokémon Camp. When simmered, these beans provide a mild flavor profile to the resulting dish. It is a **Consumable** item specifically designed for the "Curry Dex" mechanic and can be bought from specialized vendors.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a base ingredient in the Pokémon Camp cooking mini-game. It is specifically required to create various "Bean Curry" dishes. Depending on the berries used alongside it, the quality of the curry can restore a Pokémon's HP, PP, and increase friendliness/experience points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Considerably high for a non-combative item, dealing significant physical damage if thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as its primary purpose is restricted to the overworld cooking mechanic in the Sword and Shield versions.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Curry Dex** system; using it allows players to register unique entries for Bean-based recipes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from **Ingredients Sellers** found throughout the Galar region's Wild Area, Isle of Armor, and Crown Tundra. Their inventory rotates daily, making it a common but sometimes time-gated commodity.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through NPCs or found as hidden sparkling items in the Galar Wild Area (often near camp-friendly locations).
