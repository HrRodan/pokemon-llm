## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CRV4662** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Symbolic cost; typically distributed via serial codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the player can drop this crystal into the den to instantly activate a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **CRV4662** variant is hardcoded to spawn a encounter with **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no in-battle utility, it is a guaranteed method for obtaining a Corviknight with the **Gigantamax Factor** and potentially Hidden Abilities (Mirror Armor), which is a top-tier defensive staple in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard Max Raid dens, the raid triggered by this crystal does not require Wishing Pieces and does not disappear if the player loses the battle; it can be re-attempted until the end of the day.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was made available exclusively through **limited-time retail promotions** (such as serial codes provided by retailers like CoroCoro or local game stores). It is not found in the overworld or sold by vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Acquisition" item meant to facilitate access to rare Gigantamax forms that might otherwise be subject to low spawn rates in standard Max Raid dens.
