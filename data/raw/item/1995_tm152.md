## Identity & Utility
**TM152 (Giga Impact)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current numbering during **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** It is a single-use teaching device (in Gen IX) that allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Giga Impact**. As a Technical Machine, it is a consumable utility item specifically designed for move-set customization.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the Paldea region, this item is not purchased with standard currency but is instead **crafted** at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Giga Impact**. 
    * **Move Details:** A high-intensity Normal-type Physical move with **150 Base Power**. If the move hits, the user must "recharge" on the following turn, rendering them unable to take any action.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling in the current generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** While Giga Impact has immense raw power, the recharge turn is a significant liability in competitive singles (Smogon), as it allows the opponent a "free turn" to set up or switch. It sees occasional use on Pokémon with the ability **Pixilate, Refrigerate, or Aerilate** (which convert the move type and boost power) or as a powerful **Max Strike** base in previous Dynamax formats. In the current Gen IX meta, it is often a "last resort" move or used by hyper-offensive Normal types like Slaking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of fully evolved Pokémon, particularly those with high Physical Attack stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Accessible via the **TM Machine** found at any Pokémon Center in the Paldea region. 
* **Crafting Requirements:** To create TM152, a trainer typically requires:
    * **14,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **5x Tauros Hair**
    * **3x Toedscool Flaps**
    * **3x Tandemaus Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Tauros**, **Toedscool**, and **Tandemaus**.
