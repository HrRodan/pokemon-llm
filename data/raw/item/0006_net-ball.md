## Identity & Utility
**Net Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized capture device with a distinctive net-like mesh pattern. It is a **consumable** item used during wild encounters to increase capture success rates for specific species. It can be bought at specialized shops and held by Pokémon, though it has no hold effect.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Specialty Price**). It is twice as expensive as a Great Ball but significantly more effective within its niche.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants a **3× catch rate modifier** (increased to 3.5× from Generation VII onwards) if the target wild Pokémon is a **Water-type** or **Bug-type**. Against any other types, it functions with a standard **1× modifier**, making it equivalent to a basic Poké Ball.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be effectively used with the move Fling for damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** It is a staple for "Living Dex" collectors and Nuzlocke runners to secure difficult Water or Bug encounters (like high-level fishing encounters or rare Bug types in forests). It is also chosen by some players for its unique blue-and-black "net" exit animation when a Pokémon is sent out.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. As a Poké Ball, its primary interaction is with the player's bag and the capture mechanic; it does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way beyond being holdable.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in Poké Marts across most regions, typically stocked in cities near large bodies of water or dense forests (e.g., Mossdeep City in Hoenn, Eterna City in Sinnoh).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is primarily acquired through retail purchase or as a field item found in the overworld.
* **Context:** In regions like Hoenn (which features extensive water routes), the Net Ball is considered an essential mid-to-late game tool for completing the Pokédex due to the high frequency of Water-type encounters.
