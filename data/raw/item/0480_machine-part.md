## Identity & Utility
**Machine Part** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in Generation II (and featured prominently in the Generation IV remakes).
* **Description:** An essential mechanical component stolen from the Kanto Power Plant by a Team Rocket Grunt. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It exists solely to facilitate a specific story milestone.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Returning the Machine Part to the Power Plant Manager restores electricity to the Kanto region. This restoration is a prerequisite for several post-game features.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no application in competitive battling or VGC; it is strictly for overworld progression and Nuzlocke story routing.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it acts as a "trigger" for world-state changes. Restoring it enables the **Magnet Train**, allowing high-speed travel between Saffron City (Kanto) and Goldenrod City (Johto). It also allows the player to receive the **EXPN Card** for the Pokégear, which is necessary to wake the Snorlax blocking Diglett's Cave.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found hidden within the **Cerulean Gym**. In the Generation IV remakes (*HeartGold/SoulSilver*), the player must track down a foreign Team Rocket Grunt to Route 24; after his defeat, the item can be retrieved from the gym's water tiles (near the inner tubes).
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique plot object and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
