## Identity & Utility
**Power Bracer** is an **Effort-training** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized training tool to be held by a Pokémon. While it significantly encumbers the holder during combat, it accelerates the development of physical strength. It is a **Held Item** that can be purchased, typically found in specialized post-game facilities.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Specialty). *Note: While it has a cash value, it is most commonly acquired via Battle Points (BP) in various Battle Facilities.*

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon’s **Speed is reduced by 50%**. In exchange, the holder gains an additional **4 Effort Values (EVs)** in the **Attack** stat every time they earn experience from defeating a Pokémon. 
    * *Mechanic Note:* This bonus is applied before the effects of Pokérus. (In games from Generation VII onwards, this bonus was increased to +8 Attack EVs per victory).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no viable use in competitive battling** (VGC/Smogon) as the Speed penalty is a massive detriment. It is considered a **Competitive Staple for Preparation**, essential for efficiently training "Physical Sweepers" (Pokémon like Garchomp or Lucario) before they enter tournament play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Part of the "Power" series of items (including the Power Belt, Power Lens, etc.). It does not trigger any evolutions but is frequently used in breeding; if held by a parent in the Day Care or Nursery (starting in Gen IV), it guarantees the offspring will inherit the parent's **Attack IV**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at Battle Frontier, Battle Maison, Battle Tree, or Hammerlocke University shops. It is rarely found in the overworld and is usually reserved for trainers who have proven their skill in battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on any wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured training tool rather than a natural resource, meaning it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief** in the wild.
* **Strategic Context:** Best paired with a Pokémon infected with **Pokérus** to maximize Attack growth in a very short number of battles. It is the physical counterpart to the **Power Lens** (Special Attack).
