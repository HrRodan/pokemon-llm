## Identity & Utility
**Nacli Salt** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation 9 (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A fragment of salt dropped by members of the Nacli evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used exclusively at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly from the bag to heal or enhance a Pokémon, nor can it be held for a battle effect.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific crafting component required to create Technical Machines (TMs). It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to manufacture moves. Specifically, Nacli Salt is a required ingredient for crafting:
    * **TM028 (Bulldoze)**
    * **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**
    * **TM149 (Earthquake)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle preparation phase, allowing players to teach powerful physical moves like *Earthquake* to their team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen 9 "Materials" ecosystem, which encourages hunting specific wild species to unlock move-teaching capabilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Nacli**, **Naclstack**, or **Garganacl**. These Pokémon are commonly found in rocky, mountainous, and desert biomes throughout the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a traditional held item. Instead, it is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon successful combat. It is most efficiently gathered by using the **"Let's Go!" auto-battle feature** against groups of Nacli in the early-to-mid game.
