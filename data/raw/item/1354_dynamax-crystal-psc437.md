## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PSC437** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of the Galar region. It functions as a beacon to summon a specific, rare Max Raid Battle encounter. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, it is effectively "Not for Sale" as it is acquired through external distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty raid den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, the variant associated with code **PSC437**. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles (VGC/Smogon). Its value is entirely in **PvE (Player vs. Environment)** for capturing rare Pokémon or obtaining high-IV/Hidden Ability specimens.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "summoning" item for the Max Raid mechanic unique to *Pokémon Sword and Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal gameplay. It was distributed via **special serial codes** (often through retail partnerships or promotional events like those at Pokémon Centers). Once used, the crystal is consumed.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly external distribution item meant to drive engagement with physical locations or promotional campaigns.
