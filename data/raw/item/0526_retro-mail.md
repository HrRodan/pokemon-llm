## Identity & Utility
**Retro Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III** (Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).
* **Description:** A stationary item featuring a nostalgic print of three iconic Pokémon (the Kanto starters: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle). It is a **Consumable Held Item** used for communication between players during trades. Unlike standard items, once a message is written, it is held by a Pokémon to be delivered to another Trainer.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While most Mail is inexpensive (50 Poké Dollars), Retro Mail is typically obtained through specific in-game events or locations rather than standard Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a finite list of words and phrases. When held by a Pokémon, this message is transmitted to the recipient upon trading. The message can be read, erased to reuse the item, or stored in the Trainer’s PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Defensive.** In older generations, Mail had a unique mechanical niche: a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot** have its item removed by moves like *Thief*, *Covet*, or *Knock Off*, and cannot have its item swapped by *Trick* or *Switcheroo*. 
    * **Anti-PC Lock:** A Pokémon holding Retro Mail cannot be placed into the PC Storage System, acting as a safeguard (or hindrance) for specific party members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a social and utility tool. It interacts negatively with the **Pickup** ability (cannot be picked up) and **Klutz** (the Pokémon cannot "read" or utilize the item, though the anti-removal protection often still applies in certain engine iterations).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically associated with the **Kanto region** remakes (FireRed/LeafGreen). It is often found as a hidden item or gifted by NPCs to emphasize the "Retro" theme of the starters. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be acquired by the player through exploration or specific NPC interactions.
* **Legacy Note:** As of Generation VI, Mail items have been retired from the series. Pokémon holding Mail in older games must have the item removed before they can be transferred to modern titles via Poké Transporter.
