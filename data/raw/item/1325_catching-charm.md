## Identity & Utility
**Catching Charm** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized charm that passively increases the likelihood of performing a "Critical Catch"—a mechanic where a Poké Ball shakes only once in mid-air before successfully capturing a Pokémon. It is a **Passive Key Item** that remains in the player's inventory and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While in the player's Bag, it applies a multiplier to the probability of a Critical Catch occurring. This significantly streamlines the process of completing the Pokédex by reducing the number of shakes required for a successful capture and bypassing the standard triple-check capture formula more frequently.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a quality-of-life item dedicated entirely to the catching phase of the game and has no impact on competitive Trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It functions similarly to the *Shiny Charm* or *Oval Charm* as a permanent, non-consumable buff to game mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sword & Shield (Galar):** Obtained from the Game Director NPC at the Hotel Ionia in **Circhester** after becoming Champion.
    * **Scarlet & Violet (Paldea/Kitakami):** Awarded by Professor Jacq after completing the **Kitakami Pokédex** (The Teal Mask DLC).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique reward typically bestowed by developers or researchers within the game world to recognize a player's dedication to the Pokédex.
