## Identity & Utility
**Hatenna Dust** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clump of dust shed by members of the Hatenna evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. It is stored in the specialized TM Materials pocket of the Bag and is primarily used at TM Machines located at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold at shops, its primary utility is as a currency for the Technical Machine crafting system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, this material is notably used to craft moves associated with the Hatenna line’s Psychic and Fairy typing, such as **TM092 (Imprison)**, **TM120 (Psychic)**, and **TM139 (Misty Terrain)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression and customization item used in the overworld. It has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon battle formats once a Pokémon's moveset is finalized.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a resource gathered specifically through the "Auto-Battle" (Let's Go!) feature or by defeating wild Pokémon in traditional encounters.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available for purchase at Poké Marts or Delibird Presents. It must be farmed through wild encounters in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop obtained after defeating or catching wild **Hatenna**, **Hattrem**, or **Hatterene**. It is most efficiently gathered during **Mass Outbreaks** or by exploring the South Province (Area Four) and the woods of the North Province.
