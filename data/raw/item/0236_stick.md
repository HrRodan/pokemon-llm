## Identity & Utility
**Stick** (often referred to as the **Leek** in modern contexts) is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation II** (metadata indicates Generation III standardization).
* **Description:** A long, stiff stalk of leek that is synonymous with the Farfetch’d lineage. It is a **Holdable** item that is technically purchasable but rarely found in standard Poké Marts, acting more as a signature equipment piece.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Moderate**). While it has a price value, it is primarily acquired through scavenging rather than retail.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Farfetch’d** (or **Galarian Farfetch’d**), it increases the holder's critical-hit ratio by **two stages**. This significantly boosts the likelihood of dealing 1.5x damage (and ignoring defensive stat changes).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Moderate physical damage upon being thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** While Farfetch'd is rarely used in high-level competitive play (VGC/Smogon OU), the Stick is mandatory for any viable set. In Generation VIII, this item is essential for **Galarian Farfetch'd** to evolve into **Sirfetch'd**, as it facilitates the requirement of landing three critical hits in a single battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the primary catalyst for the evolution of Galarian Farfetch'd. It does not provide any benefit to other Pokémon species; for them, it is a dead item slot.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally unavailable in standard shops. It must usually be found in specific overworld locations or taken from wild populations.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is the signature held item of wild **Farfetch’d**. Players typically obtain it by catching wild Farfetch’d or using moves like **Thief**, **Covet**, or the **Pickup** ability to harvest it from them. In many games, wild Farfetch'd have a 5% chance of holding this item.
