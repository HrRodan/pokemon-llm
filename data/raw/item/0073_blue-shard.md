## Identity & Utility
**Blue Shard** is a **Collectible** item introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A small, vibrant blue fragment of an ancient implement. It is a **Consumable Currency** item that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts but carries a resale value of 1,000 Poké Dollars. It serves as a primitive form of barter for high-value services and rare items.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Barter Value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Blue Shard has **no direct effect** when used from the bag or held in battle. Its utility is purely transactional, acting as a specialized currency for Move Tutors and specific NPCs:
    * **TM Acquisition (Gen IV):** Trade 10 shards for **TM18 (Rain Dance)** on Sinnoh Route 212.
    * **Move Tutoring (Platinum):** Used as payment for tutors in Snowpoint City and the Survival Area (often used for moves like *Iron Defense*, *Signal Beam*, or *Zen Headbutt*).
    * **Berry Bartering (HGSS):** Trade 1 shard for a bundle of three berries (Chesto, Oran, Wiki) in Violet City, or a different set (Bluk, Cornn, Kelpsy) near Fuchsia City's Pal Park.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Zero viability** as a held item. However, it is historically critical for **Teambuilding**, as it was required to teach competitive moves to Pokémon via Move Tutors in older generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "Underground" attribute, reflecting its primary discovery method in the Sinnoh region's mining mini-game.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found through environmental interaction such as **Mining** in the Sinnoh Underground, using **Dive** in Hoenn to find hidden items on the seafloor, or as a reward in the Pokéwalker. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Clamperl** (5% chance). This makes Clamperl the primary biological source for farming these shards, often simplified by using Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase encounter rates or **Frisk/Covet** to steal the item.
* **Lore context:** The flavor text suggests these shards are pieces of ancient tools or artifacts, hinting at a connection to the historical craftsmanship of the Pokémon world before modern TMs were standardized.
