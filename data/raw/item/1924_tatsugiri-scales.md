## Identity & Utility
**Tatsugiri Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by the Mimicry Pokémon, Tatsugiri. As a member of the "TM Materials" category, it serves as a reagent for the Technical Machine Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable** material that **cannot be bought** from standard Poké Marts but has a defined sell/exchange value.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Standard crafting value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as a currency/component for crafting TMs. In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, these scales are required to synthesize specific moves, most notably **TM169 (Draco Meteor)** and **TM142 (Hydro Pump)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the item itself has no battlefield utility, it is essential for teaching high-tier Special moves like *Hydro Pump* and *Draco Meteor* to competitive team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Tatsugiri** (including Curly, Droopy, and Stretchy forms). They are also commonly rewarded for defeating Tatsugiri in **Tera Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is deposited directly into the player's "TM Materials" pocket upon the conclusion of an encounter. 
* **Regional Context:** Found primarily in the **Casseroya Lake** region of Paldea, where Tatsugiri are abundant. The scales are a testament to the Pokémon's slippery and resilient nature, often found where it interacts with its symbiotic partner, Dondozo.
