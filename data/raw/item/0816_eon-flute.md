## Identity & Utility
**Eon Flute** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI** (noted in this record under Generation VII metadata).
* **Description:** A specialized musical instrument used to summon the Eon Duo (Latios or Latias) to the player's location regardless of geography. It is an **unlimited-use Key Item** that cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; obtained via story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When played in the overworld, it summons Latios (in Omega Ruby/Sun) or Latias (in Alpha Sapphire/Moon). This triggers the **Soaring** mechanic, allowing the player to manually fly over the region map in real-time, bypassing the traditional "Fly" menu and granting access to "Mirage Spots" and high-altitude encounters.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a strictly overworld utility item used for navigation and legendary Pokémon hunting; it has no function in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. However, it requires either **Latios or Latias** to be in the player's party or PC storage to function. It allows the player to Mega Evolve the Eon Duo in mid-air during the Soaring sequence without the need for a Mega Bracelet.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (ORAS), it is gifted to the player by **Steven Stone** after the completion of the Primal Reversion story arc (Groudon/Kyogre encounter). In Generation VII (Sun/Moon), it remains in the game's data as a legacy item, though its primary "Soaring" utility is largely replaced by the Poké Ride system.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon**. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact tied to the player's bond with the Eon Duo.
