## Identity & Utility
**Gooey Mulch** is a **Mulch (Gardening Consumable)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer used during the Berry-growing process. It is applied to soft soil patches before a Berry is planted to alter the plant's growth cycle. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally **Buyable** in regions where Berry cultivation mechanics are prominent (specifically Sinnoh and Johto).
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a patch of soil before planting a Berry, it increases the number of times a Berry plant will automatically regrow after dying by **25%**. This allows for a more "set-and-forget" farming style, ensuring the plant returns for more cycles before the soil becomes empty.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item strictly for the overworld gardening mechanic. It provides no benefit in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a specific mechanic-booster for the Berry planting systems found in *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, HeartGold,* and *SoulSilver*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily sold at the **Flower Shop in Floaroma Town** (Sinnoh) or from the **Berry Master's house** (Route 208). In later generations (Gen VI/VII), flavor text indicates it is "unsuitable for the soil" of those regions, effectively making it a legacy item or a "junk" item in those contexts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. Acquisition is restricted to specialized gardening shops or finding it as hidden items in rural routes.
* **Mechanic Context:** While other mulches focus on growth speed (Growth Mulch) or yield (Boost Mulch), Gooey Mulch is the "Longevity" option, favored by players who do not check their Berry patches frequently.
