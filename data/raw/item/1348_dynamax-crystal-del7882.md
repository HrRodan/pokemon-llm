* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** While not a held item used in competitive matches, it is used by players to secure high-individual value (IV) Pokémon or specific Hidden Abilities (HAs) in a controlled raid environment.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed as **Event Rewards** or **Pre-order Bonuses**. Specifically, the Del7882 crystal was part of the *Pokémon Sword and Shield Double Pack* bonus, allowing Sword players to encounter Larvitar (usually a Shield exclusive) and Shield players to encounter Jangmo-o.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It exists strictly as a digital distribution item to unlock localized raid content.
