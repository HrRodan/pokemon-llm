## Identity & Utility
**Left Poké Ball** is a **Key Item / Quest Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This specific Poké Ball contains a Pokémon that has been separated from its Trainer. Its origins are traced back to Ula’ula Island. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be used for capturing wild Pokémon, nor can it be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item functions exclusively as a quest objective. It has no mechanical function in battle and cannot be used from the bag to initiate a capture sequence. Its presence in the inventory is required to trigger or complete a specific side-quest event in the Alola region.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is strictly a narrative/story-driven item used during a playthrough or Nuzlocke for world-building and rewards.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is fundamentally a "placeholder" for a Pokémon that belongs to an NPC.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found specifically in **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon** on Ula'ula Island. It is tied to a localized side quest (often involving the Malie City Recycling Plant or the "Lost Poké Ball" event), where the player acts as a courier to return the lost Pokémon to its rightful owner.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time acquisition provided during environmental exploration in the Alola region.
