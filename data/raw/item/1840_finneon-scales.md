## Identity & Utility
**Finneon Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A biological material shed or harvested from the Finneon evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create specific TMs. It cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts but can be exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Material Grade**). While its sell value is low, its utility value lies in move acquisition.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting Water-type moves at the TM Machine. It is commonly required for recipes such as **TM011 (Water Pulse)** and **TM050 (Rain Dance)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A (Utility Only).** This item has no direct impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) other than being a prerequisite for teaching essential moves to a team during the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource introduced to facilitate the Generation IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop in the Paldea region (and potentially other Gen IX DLC areas). It is added to the inventory upon defeating or catching members of the Finneon line.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Finneon** and **Lumineon**. Players looking to optimize move-sets often farm these near ocean biomes or tropical coastlines. 
* **Context:** In the ecosystem of Pokémon materials, Finneon Scales represent a mid-tier Water-type resource, mirroring the bioluminescent and delicate nature of the "Beautifly of the Sea."
