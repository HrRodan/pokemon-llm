## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PEG8308)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable key item used within the Pokémon Sword and Shield Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a single-use consumable that remains active until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically categorized as very cheap, though in practice, these are **special acquisition items** not typically found in standard Mart inventories).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-region of the Galar Wild Area) while carrying this item, a red beam of light is triggered. This forces a specific Pokémon encounter (determined by the crystal's ID) to appear in a Max Raid Battle. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for overworld raid triggering. It provides a path to obtain Pokémon that may have Competitive viability (High IVs, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax factors), but the item itself has no utility in Trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it interacts directly with the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic, allowing players to bypass the RNG of standard Den spawns to hunt specific species or rare rewards.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are almost exclusively distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events (such as retail distributions at GameStop/Target/GAME) or as bonuses for purchasing strategy guides or the Expansion Pass. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability. It is considered a rare, event-only resource.
* **Context:** The specific "PEG8308" suffix denotes a unique encounter code. While the flavor text uses a variable placeholder, these crystals typically granted access to rare encounters like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax-capable species during the Sword and Shield era.
