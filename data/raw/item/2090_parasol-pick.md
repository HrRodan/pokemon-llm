## Identity & Utility
**Parasol-Pick** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** A decorative sandwich pick shaped like a small sunshade or parasol. It is a consumable utility item used during the sandwich-making process at a Picnic. It serves as the final component to secure ingredients in place, completing the meal and activating its associated bonuses.
* **Cost:** 800 Poké Dollars (Accessible/Standard decorative tier).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a Picnic, the Parasol-Pick completes a sandwich. Successfully placing the pick ensures the sandwich layers stay together, allowing the player to receive **Meal Powers** (such as Encounter Power, Egg Power, or Sparkling Power) based on the ingredients used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly restricted to the overworld Picnic mechanic. It is essential for "Quality of Life" competitive preparation, specifically for breeding (Egg Power) and training (Exp. Point Power or Encounter Power).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts solely with the **Sandwich/Picnic mechanic** in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized culinary and picnic supply shops throughout the Paldea region, most notably at **Pick-A-Lop** branches in major cities like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced consumer good for trainers.
* **Context:** The Parasol-Pick is part of a series of cosmetic sandwich picks. While it provides no mechanical difference compared to a basic Silver Pick, it allows trainers to customize the aesthetic of their picnic spread. It represents the "Leisure/Vacation" theme prevalent in the Paldean region's culture.
