## Identity & Utility
**Smart Candy** is a **Vitamin** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized energy-dense confection used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's performance. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is primarily used from the bag to increase the **Special Attack** stat.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low purchase/sell value, its primary value is derived from its role in the "Awakening Value" (AV) system rather than monetary trade.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases a Pokémon's **Special Attack** stat by 1 point (up to the maximum limit of 200 AVs per stat). Unlike traditional Vitamins (like Calcium), this is part of the specific LGPE stat-capping mechanic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move **Fling** and held items do not exist in the version groups where this item is present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is irrelevant for standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it only functions within the *Let's Go* series' unique stat growth system. It is essential for "Master Trainer" battles and LGPE-specific post-game content.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several stat-specific candies (alongside Tough, Mighty, Quick, etc.) used to optimize a Pokémon's Special Attack potential.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for **transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak** or by achieving high **Catch Combos** of specific Pokémon species that yield Special Attack rewards (e.g., Psyduck, Gastly, or Magnemite).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally "farmed" through the catching mechanic rather than through the **Pickup** ability or wild theft. In the context of the *Let's Go* ecosystem, it represents the refinement of Pokémon data into physical growth stimulants.
