## Identity & Utility
**Legendary Clue 2** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra DLC).
* **Description:** A handwritten note by the character Peony featuring crude drawings and cryptic instructions. It serves as a primary quest item within the Crown Tundra sub-story, specifically focusing on the "Legendary Giants." It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a guide and progress marker for the "The Terrible Titans... Lurking Locked Away!" legendary quest. Possession of this item allows the player to track their progress in capturing the Regi quintet (Regirock, Regice, Registeel, and either Regieleki or Regidrago).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and narrative advancement in the post-game/DLC content.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, it is the mechanical trigger required to solve the puzzles in the various ruins (Rock Peak, Iceberg, Iron, and Split-Decision Ruins) scattered across the Crown Tundra.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically from **Peony** at the base camp in **Freezington** shortly after the player arrives in the Crown Tundra and agrees to go on "Adventures" with him.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item tied to the player's Save Data.
* **Lore Context:** The clue contains Peony’s personal observations and sketches of the "Giants" (the Regi trio and their masters). It reflects Peony's enthusiastic, if unpolished, approach to Pokémon exploration, contrasting with the more academic descriptions found in the Pokédex. It is one of three legendary clues (alongside Clue 1 for Calyrex and Clue 3 for the Galarian Birds) required to complete the DLC's main storyline.
