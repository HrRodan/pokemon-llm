## Identity & Utility
**Steel Tera Shard** is a specialized **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A mysterious crystalline fragment of a Tera Jewel. It is a **Consumable/Modification** item used as a currency to alter the fundamental nature of a Pokémon's Terastal phenomenon. While it has a nominal value, it is primarily a resource gathered through exploration and combat rather than standard retail purchase.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though its utility far outweighs its monetary sell price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Steel Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to **Steel**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Essential.** Steel is arguably the most valuable defensive Tera Type in competitive play (VGC and Smogon). Converting a Pokémon to a Steel Tera Type provides critical resistances to Dragon, Fairy, Psychic, Normal, Grass, Steel, Rock, Flying, and Bug-type moves, while also providing an immunity to Poison-type moves and Sandstorm damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Terastal mechanic**, allowing for deep customization of a Pokémon's defensive profile or boosting the STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) of Steel-type moves like *Make It Rain* or *Flash Cannon*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for completing **Tera Raid Battles** (specifically against Steel-type Raid Bosses). They can also be found as sparkling overworld pickups in the **Paldea** region, particularly within **Area Zero**, or as rewards from the Academy Ace Tournament and various NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is tied to the **Tera Raid** gameplay loop or the **Cram-o-matic** equivalent (Item Printer) in the Blueberry Academy. In the *Indigo Disk* DLC, shards can be efficiently farmed through the Item Printer using BP and various Pokémon materials.
