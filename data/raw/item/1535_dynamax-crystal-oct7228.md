## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Oct7228)** is a **Dynamax-crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a consumable event item designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While it has a internal cost value, it is not sold in Poké Marts and is obtained exclusively via serial codes or distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is activated. This allows the player to challenge a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon—specifically **Gigantamax Sandaconda** (associated with the Oct7228 distribution code)—regardless of the current weather or standard den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for PvE (Player vs. Environment) Max Raid Battles. Its primary value is for catching rare Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item is consumed immediately upon the activation of the den. If the player loses the raid, they can re-attempt it as long as it is the same calendar day.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Only.** This specific crystal was distributed via serial codes as part of promotional tie-ins (such as retail distributions). It is not available through natural exploration or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital "key" used to unlock temporary content within the Galar region's Wild Area.
