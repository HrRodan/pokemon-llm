## Identity & Utility
**Ghost Gem** is a **Jewel** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A gem containing a spectral essence that serves as a single-use power booster for Ghost-type attacks. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that triggers automatically in battle. 
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, though its availability is typically restricted to special overworld mechanics rather than standard Mart inventories).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Ghost-type move, the Ghost Gem increases that move's power by **1.5×** (in Gen V) or **1.3×** (in Gen VI+) and is consumed immediately.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** Not applicable (The item is consumed by the attack before Fling can be utilized, or fails to provide the boost if Flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact **Niche** item. In its debut generation, Gems provided a massive burst of damage without the HP drain of a Life Orb or the move-locking of Choice items. It is exceptionally potent on Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (like **Drifblim**), as consuming the Gem to boost a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) Shadow Ball or Acrobatics simultaneously doubles the user's Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with moves like **Thief** or **Covet** (it cannot be stolen if consumed first) and abilities like **Recycle** or **Harvest**, which can potentially restore the item after use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through non-traditional means. In its home region of Unova, it is frequently found in **Dust Clouds** within caves (Challenger's Cave, Victory Road). In later generations, elemental gems like the Ghost Gem became increasingly rare, often being excluded from standard gameplay in favor of the Normal Gem.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon in standard encounters; it must be sourced via environmental exploration or specific mini-games.
