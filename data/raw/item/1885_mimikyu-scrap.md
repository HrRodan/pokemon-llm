## Identity & Utility
**Mimikyu Scrap** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A fragment left behind by a Mimikyu after battle. It is a consumable crafting resource that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a TM Machine. It cannot be used directly in the overworld or held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Base Crafting Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient for the **TM Machine**. It is combined with League Points (LP) to create Technical Machines (TMs) that teach various moves to Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the move-teaching system introduced in Scarlet and Violet. Based on world knowledge, it is required for crafting high-value Ghost and Fairy-type TMs, such as **TM109 (Trick)** and **TM114 (Shadow Ball)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Mimikyu**. It can also be found as a sparkling "hidden item" on the ground in areas where Mimikyu naturally spawn (such as the Tagtree Thicket or ruins in the Paldea region).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by the Pokémon; rather, it is added directly to the player's "TM Materials" pocket upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability.
