## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Umi5563** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item designed to be used at the Watchtower Lair, located in the Ruins of Watchtower within the Galar Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay; while its internal data lists a nominal cost of 20 Poké Dollars, it is functionally **Not for Sale**.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Internal value; technically a **Special Acquisition** item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific **Max Raid Battle** that remains active until the end of the calendar day. This specific crystal, designated "Umi5563," was primarily used to encounter **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld mechanic of initiating a Raid. However, the Pokémon captured from the resulting Raid may possess the **Gigantamax Factor**, unique moves, or Hidden Abilities relevant to competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Wild Area. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the Max Raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals were distributed via **Special Serial Codes** provided through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, EB Games, or Target) or promotional magazines (like CoroCoro). They are not available through natural progression or in-game Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "Other" category item, distinct from the Pickup table or standard loot pools.
* **Lore Context:** These crystals are concentrated masses of Galar Particle energy, localized to trigger an immediate Dynamax or Gigantamax phenomenon at specific historical sites (the Watchtower Lair). They allow trainers to bypass the randomness of Wishing Pieces to hunt specific rare encounters.
