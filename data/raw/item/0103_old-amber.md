## Identity & Utility
**Old Amber** is a **Dex-Completion Fossil** introduced in Generation I (refined in Generation IV for the Sinnoh Underground).
* **Description:** A piece of ancient amber containing prehistoric genetic material, characterized by its clear, tawny, and reddish tint. It is a **Consumable/Single-use** item (upon revival) that serves as the catalyst for obtaining extinct Pokémon. While it has a high listed price, it is rarely "bought" in a standard Mart, often serving as a rare find or gift.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specialized research facility—such as the **Museum of Science in Pewter City** (Kanto) or the **Mining Museum in Oreburgh City** (Sinnoh)—it can be regenerated into the Rock/Flying-type Pokémon **Aerodactyl**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High). While not intended for combat, it deals significant physical damage when thrown using the move Fling, though the item is consumed in the process.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility in held-item slots. However, it is the sole gateway to obtaining **Aerodactyl**, a historically dominant competitive Pokémon known for its elite Speed tier and Pressure/Rock Head abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution; instead, it triggers **Pokémon Resurrection**. Once the process is complete, the Old Amber is removed from the inventory and replaced with a Level 5, 15, or 20 Aerodactyl (depending on the game version).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In Kanto, it is obtained as a gift from a scientist in the back of the **Pewter Museum of Science** (requires HM01 Cut).
    * In Sinnoh (Gen IV), it is a rare find within the **Grand Underground** via the mining minigame after obtaining the National Pokédex. 
    * In later generations, it can often be found by using **Rock Smash** on breakable rocks in specific prehistoric-themed zones (e.g., Glittering Cave in Kalos).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to environmental discovery (mining, smashing rocks) or scripted NPC interactions. It is frequently sought after by players utilizing the **Pickup** ability in certain high-level tables in specific games (though rare).
