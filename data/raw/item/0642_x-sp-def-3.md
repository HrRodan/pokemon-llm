## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Def 3** is a Miracle Shooter Battle Item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, high-tier battle enhancer that drastically boosts defensive capabilities. It is a **Consumable** item that **Cannot be bought** with standard currency. It functions as an advanced variant of the standard X Sp. Def, specifically balanced for the point-based "Wonder Launcher" mechanic in multiplayer battles.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through point accumulation during battle).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during battle, it raises the target's **Special Defense stat by three stages** (+150% of the original value).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** It is completely unavailable in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it is tied exclusively to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic. Within that specific Gen V ruleset, it is a high-value defensive tool used to survive powerful special attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no effect on Pokémon evolution. As with all "X" items, the stat boost is lost if the Pokémon is switched out of battle or if the move *Haze* is used.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to **Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2**. It does not occupy space in the standard player bag; instead, it is selected from the Wonder Launcher menu during wireless battles once the player has accumulated enough points over several turns.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, making it one of the few consumable items entirely restricted to a specific battle mode.
