## Identity & Utility
**Picnic-set** is a specialized tool categorized under **Picnic** items, introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** It represents the essential gear required to set up a camp in the overworld. It functions as a core mechanic interface rather than a traditional consumable. It is a **Key Item-equivalent** functional tool that **cannot be bought** or sold, as it is provided to the player as part of their standard journey equipment.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated in the overworld (on flat terrain), the Picnic-set initiates a **Picnic**. This state allows the player to interact with their party Pokémon to increase friendship, restore HP/PP/Status through sandwiches, and most critically, **generate Pokémon Eggs**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key items and functional tools cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While it cannot be held or used in a battle, it is the primary method for competitive preparation in Generation IX. It is used to obtain Eggs (Breeding), change Tera Types (via farming Shards with Meal Powers), and hunt for specific Paradox or Shiny Pokémon through "Sparkling" and "Encounter" Meal Powers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for the **Egg Group** mechanics in Paldea; eggs appear in the picnic basket based on the compatibility of Pokémon in the party. It also facilitates the "Mirror Herb" egg move transfer mechanic, where one Pokémon can learn a move from another during a picnic without breeding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically obtained by the player early in the story of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It remains in the player's possession permanently.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon.
* **Customization:** While the base Picnic-set is a standard utility, players can modify its aesthetic by purchasing different tablecloths, water bottles, and cups from **Picnic-Knacks** stores in cities like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. These changes are purely cosmetic and do not alter the mechanical benefits of the Picnic-set.
