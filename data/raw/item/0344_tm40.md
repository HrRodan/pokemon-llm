## Identity & Utility
**TM40** is a **Technical Machine** (Machine) introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn Region).
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon a specific move that it may not learn through leveling up. While historically and primarily associated with the move **Aerial Ace**, the move taught by this TM varies depending on the specific game region (e.g., teaching **Psychic** in the Kanto *Let's Go* series or **Air Cutter** in Paldea). It is a single-use consumable in older generations and a multi-use or craftable item in more recent titles.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a compatible Pokémon a specific move. Based on the provided data and historical context:
    * **Primary (Gen III–VII):** Teaches **Aerial Ace**, a Flying-type move with 60 Base Power that is guaranteed to hit regardless of accuracy or evasion modifiers.
    * **Variant (Let's Go):** Teaches **Psychic**, a powerful Psychic-type move with 90 Base Power that may lower the target's Special Defense.
    * **Legacy (Gen I/II):** Historically represented Skull Bash (Gen I) and Defense Curl (Gen II).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Aerial Ace** is a niche competitive choice, primarily utilized by Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (like Scyther or Breloom) to boost its power to 90, or as a reliable check against "Minimize" or "Double Team" evasion strategies. The **Psychic** variant is a top-tier competitive staple for Special Attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Move compatibility depends entirely on the Pokémon's individual move pool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hoenn region (Gen III), it is famously gifted by Gym Leader Winona after her defeat. In other titles, it is commonly found in Poké Marts or as an overworld item in mountainous or windy areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or certain Hold Items, TMs must be found, purchased, or received as rewards from NPCs.
* **Economic Value:** At 1,000 Poké Dollars, it is priced as a standard mid-tier TM, making it highly accessible for early-to-mid-game team building.
