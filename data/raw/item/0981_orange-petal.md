## Identity & Utility
**Orange Petal** is a **Key Item** (Quest Item) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A pressed flower petal received from Trial Captain Ilima during Mina’s Trial in the Alola region. It is a **Consumable Quest Item** (consumed upon completion of the trial) that **cannot** be bought or sold. It serves as a progress marker in the quest to collect seven distinct petals to create the Rainbow Flower.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a mandatory quest objective in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*. Collecting this petal, along with six others (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green, Pink, and Purple), is required to challenge the Totem Pokémon Ribombee and complete Mina's trial.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no effect in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a plot-essential item used exclusively during the main story progression of the Alola trials.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is a trigger for the final stage of Mina's Trial. Once all petals are gathered, they are woven into the **Rainbow Flower** key item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively from **Trial Captain Ilima**. In *Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, the player must defeat Ilima in a battle at the Hau'oli Cemetery to receive the petal.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. As a unique trial-specific item, it cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore Context:** The Orange Petal represents the trial of the Verdant Cavern/Melemele Island, reflecting Ilima's role as the first Trial Captain the player encounters. It is one of the seven components needed to prove the trainer's bond with the captains of Alola.
