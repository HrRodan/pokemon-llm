## Identity & Utility
**Cubone Candy** is a **Species-specific Stat Enhancer** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable candy packed with unique energy tailored to the Cubone biological line. Unlike standard stat-specific candies (like Health Candy or Mighty Candy), this item provides a holistic boost. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold but is not typically purchased from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily intended for usage rather than commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a member of the **Cubone** or **Marowak** (including Alolan Marowak) evolutionary line, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 **Awakening Value (AV)** point. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in the games where it exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. In these games, AVs replace traditional Effort Values (EVs). Because a Pokémon can max out AVs in every stat, Cubone Candy is the most efficient way to create a "perfect" Cubone or Marowak for LGPE's post-game "Master Trainers" or local competitive play. It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It strictly interacts with the **Awakening Value** system. It is most effective for players looking to bypass the grind of using individual stat candies.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily through the **Catch Combo** mechanic by repeatedly catching wild Cubone (found in locations like Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town). It is also rewarded to the player by **Professor Oak** when "transferring" Cubone to his lab.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via **mass-catching** or by walking with a Cubone/Marowak inside the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Context:** The item represents the "essence" of the species, rewarding the trainer for their mastery and dedication to catching and researching that specific family of Pokémon.
