## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DEL7906)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable event item designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in Galar's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until midnight on the day of activation. It functions as a "Beacon" to force a rare encounter.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Cheap). While it has a internal price of 20, it is historically a **Special Acquisition** item obtained via serial codes from retail distributions rather than standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive den in the Wild Area's West Lake Axewell), the player can use this item to spawn a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. The `DEL7906` variant is part of a series of promotional crystals used to distribute rare Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or version-exclusives.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no in-battle effect, it is a vital tool for competitive players to capture Pokémon with guaranteed high IVs, Hidden Abilities, or the **Gigantamax Factor**, which are otherwise difficult to farm.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid encounter. It bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces at the designated location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Promotional Serial Codes** (often through retail partnerships like GameStop, Pokémon Center, or Target). It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or stolen using Thief/Covet.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals contain concentrated Galar Particles, allowing a trainer to summon a powerful Dynamax entity to a specific location regardless of the current den activity or Wishing Piece availability.
