## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (UMA4295)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Wild Area (West Lake Axewell) of the Galar region. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be bought from standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the technical cost is low, these items are functionally priceless as they are typically distributed via external promotional codes or serial events rather than standard gameplay.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair**, it causes a specific Pokémon (in this case, typically a **Gigantamax Sandaconda** based on the UMA4295 designation) to appear as a Max Raid boss. The raid remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for collection and Pokédex completion. It allows players to encounter rare Gigantamax forms or Version-Exclusive Pokémon that might otherwise be difficult to find in standard Raid Dens.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that may possess the Gigantamax Factor or High Individual Values (IVs).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** provided during special retail promotions (such as those from GameStop, GAME, or Pokémon Center events) or as bonuses for purchasing specific software bundles (like the Sword & Shield Dual Pack). It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to promotional distribution mechanics.
