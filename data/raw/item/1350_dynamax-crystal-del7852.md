## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal DEL7852** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event-based consumable used to trigger unique Max Raid Battles. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that technically has a low internal cost but is not available through traditional retail.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; despite the nominal internal cost, these items are typically obtained via serial codes or promotional distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, it activates a Max Raid Battle. The specific encounter tied to "DEL7852" allows players to battle and potentially catch a Pokémon that may otherwise be a version exclusive or rare encounter (historically tied to distributions like the *Sword & Shield* Dual Pack pre-orders).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Preparatory.** While the item itself has no in-battle effect, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess high Individual Values (IVs), specific Egg Moves, or Hidden Abilities, making them ideal parents for competitive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid at the Watchtower Lair.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are **Event-Exclusive**. They were primarily distributed via serial codes included with physical retail bonuses (such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack) or through specific store promotions (like GameStop or Pokémon Center events). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to bridge the gap between version exclusives (e.g., allowing a *Sword* player to encounter a *Shield* exclusive like Larvitar).
* **Location Context:** The "Watchtower Lair" is the only location where this item can be used. If the player loses the raid, they can re-challenge the den as many times as needed until midnight of the day the crystal was activated.
