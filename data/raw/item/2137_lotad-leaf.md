## Identity & Utility
**Lotad Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask)**.
* **Description:** A biological byproduct shed or dropped by members of the Lotad evolutionary line. As a dedicated crafting resource, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Very Cheap/Value for Exchange**). In-game, this value typically represents its sell price or its conversion rate into League Points (LP) at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Lotad Leaf serves exclusively as a currency for the **Technical Machine Machine**. It is combined with League Points (LP) to craft specific TMs (Technical Machines) to teach moves to Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles. Its value is strictly limited to the preparation phase of competitive team building (Movepool management).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is specifically linked to the **Lotad, Lombre, and Ludicolo** family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Lotad**, **Lombre**, or **Ludicolo**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is "yielded" by wild Pokémon upon defeat. In the Paldea/Kitakami regions, players typically farm these in the **Kitakami** region (specifically around the Apple Hills or Loyalty Plaza) where Lotad is naturally found in water-rich environments.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents the unique lily-pad-like structure of the Lotad line, synthesized by the TM Machine to replicate the elemental data of Grass or Water-type maneuvers.
