## Identity & Utility
**Fossilized Bird** is a **Dex-completion (Fossil)** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An ancient fossil fragment representing the upper body of a prehistoric avian creature. In the Galar region, these fossils are unique because they are "mismatched" and must be combined with a different fossil type to be successfully revived. It is a **Consumable Evolution Material** that is not typically found in standard Poké Marts but holds high monetary value.
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (Expensive; primarily treated as a valuable treasure or rare excavation find).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the researcher **Cara Liss** on Route 6 in Galar, this item can be fused with a "bottom" fossil piece to revive a chimeric Pokémon.
* **Revival Combinations:**
    * **Fossilized Bird + Fossilized Drake:** Revives **Dracozolt** (Electric/Dragon).
    * **Fossilized Bird + Fossilized Dino:** Revives **Arctozolt** (Electric/Ice).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (Significant physical damage, though the item is lost upon use).
    * **Competitive Use:** None as a held item. However, the Pokémon resulting from this fossil—specifically **Dracozolt**—have been high-tier competitive threats in VGC and Smogon formats due to the move *Bolt Beak*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Serves as a revival component. It does not trigger standard evolution but is the only method to obtain the "Zolt" line of fossils.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword*, it is easily obtained from the **Digging Duo** (specifically the Reward brother) in the Wild Area and from an NPC at the Stow-on-Side Pokémon Center. In *Pokémon Shield*, it is significantly rarer and typically requires extensive use of the Digging Duo to locate.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered via the **Digging Duo** excavation mechanic or found as hidden treasure on Route 6.
* **Lore Context:** The Fossilized Bird represents a critique of early paleontology (specifically the "Bone Wars"), where scientists incorrectly assembled fossils from different species, leading to the creation of biological anomalies.
