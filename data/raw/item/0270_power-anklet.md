## Identity & Utility
**Power-anklet** is an **Effort-Training** held item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
*   **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon during training. It is designed to intentionally burden the holder, reducing its Speed in battle to promote greater Speed stat growth (Effort Values) upon defeating opponents. It is a **Holdable Training Item** that can be purchased, typically through specialized vendors.
*   **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive; often requires specialized currency like Battle Points in various games).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon’s current **Speed stat is decreased by 50%**. In exchange, whenever the holder earns Effort Values (EVs) from a battle, they receive an **additional 4 Speed EVs**. 
*   **Mechanical Nuance:** The +4 EV bonus is applied *before* the doubling effect of Pokérus, making it a highly efficient tool for rapid stat development.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** 70 (Strong physical impact, but no additional secondary effect upon Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** This item has **zero viability** in actual competitive ladder play (VGC/Smogon) because the Speed penalty is a massive disadvantage. However, it is a **mandatory staple** for competitive "building" and post-game training to optimize a Pokémon's stats before entering a tournament.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is part of the "Power Item" series (alongside the Power Weight, Bracer, Belt, Lens, and Band). It is specifically targeted by players looking to max out the Speed tier of "Sweeper" Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Typically not found in standard Poké Marts. It is primarily available at **Battle Facilities** (such as the Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, or Battle Tree) in exchange for BP (Battle Points). In later generations, it can sometimes be purchased at specialized Delibird Presents or similar boutiques.
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial training tool crafted for trainers.
*   **Breeding Utility (World Knowledge):** Since Generation VI, if held by a parent in the Daycare/Nursery, the Power Anklet guarantees that the **Speed IV (Individual Value)** of the parent is passed down to the offspring, making it essential for perfect-IV breeding.
