    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for the **crafting economy** and has no impact on competitive battle stats or strategy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching a wild **Cryogonal**.

* **Context:** In the Paldea region, Cryogonal can typically be found in the **Dalizapa Passage** and **Glaseado Mountain** biomes. Players farming this material should focus on these snowy environments to gather enough resources for powerful Ice-type coverage moves.
