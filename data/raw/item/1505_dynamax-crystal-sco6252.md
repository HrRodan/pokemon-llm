## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6252** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. It is designed to be used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Once activated, the effect lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; however, this is a placeholder price as the item is primarily distributed via promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Larvitar**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. This allows the player to encounter and catch the Pokémon regardless of the current weather or standard spawn tables.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. It is strictly a utility item for the main game/collection to provide early access to specific Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive (Larvitar is normally exclusive to Pokémon Shield).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. It facilitates the capture of a Larvitar, which evolves into Pupitar and eventually the pseudo-legendary Tyranitar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed as a promotional bonus for players who purchased the **Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack** or through specific retail distributions. It is not available through Marts or standard gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item tied to the player's inventory via a Serial Code.
* **World Context:** Dynamax Crystals (S-Crystals) represent a controlled way for trainers to harness Galar's Power Spots. While standard Max Raid Battles are random, these crystals provide a guaranteed encounter, making them highly sought after for Nuzlocke runs (as a "static" encounter) or for completing the Pokédex early.
