## Identity & Utility
**TR28 (Megahorn)** is a **Technical Record (TR)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Megahorn** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in the Galar region, Technical Records are consumed upon use. It represents a high-tier offensive resource for physical attackers.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). In the Galar region, these are typically traded for high amounts of Watts (W) rather than standard currency at specialized Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Megahorn**. Megahorn is a powerful **Bug-type physical move** with 120 Base Power and 85% Accuracy. It is the strongest Bug-type move without a negative drawback (like recharge or recoil), though it has no secondary effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120. This is an exceptionally high value for the move **Fling**, making it a viable one-time heavy damage option if held, though using it to teach the move is generally more efficient.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Staple Physical Coverage.** Megahorn is highly valued in competitive formats (Smogon/VGC) for physical attackers needing to hit Psychic, Dark, or Grass-types for massive damage. Common users include Pokémon like **Heracross**, **Rhyperior**, and **Escavalier**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly a move-teaching tool and does not trigger evolution or interact with specific defensive abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword and Shield**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (availability rotates daily) or received as a reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Bug-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Its acquisition is tied to the Max Raid den ecosystem and the Galar region's unique Watt economy. Its high cost reflects its status as a premier physical "nuke" move.
