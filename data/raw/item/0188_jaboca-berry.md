## Identity & Utility
**Jaboca-berry** is a **Berry (Consumable Held Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized reactive berry designed to be held in battle. When the holder is struck by a **physical attack**, the berry is consumed to deal reciprocal damage to the attacker. It is a single-use consumable that is technically holdable but functions as a reactive trap.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically acquired through cultivation or events rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a physical move, the attacker takes damage equal to **1/8 (12.5%) of its maximum HP**. This effect occurs after the attack damage is calculated and is consumed immediately upon activation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally not recommended for use with the move Fling).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dragon-type** attack with **100 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **Niche Competitive Item**. It is most effectively used to break an opponent's **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, or **Multiscale** (e.g., Dragonite) if they strike with a physical move. It is often paired with defensive Pokémon that can survive a hit to ensure the opponent takes chip damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a pair with the **Rowap Berry**, which shares the same mechanic but triggers on special attacks instead of physical ones.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically rare. In Sinnoh (Gen IV), it was often distributed via special events or the Nintendo Zone. In later generations like X/Y, it could be obtained via **Berry Mutation** (cross-breeding an Abbav and Spicy Berry). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon according to current field data (`total_held_by: 0`). It must typically be obtained through specific in-game traders, events, or advanced berry gardening mechanics.
* **Harvesting:** Like all berries, once planted in soft soil, it will yield multiple Jaboca Berries over time, making it a renewable resource once the first specimen is acquired.
