## Identity & Utility
**Normal Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystalline shard that glows with a faint, neutral light. It is a **Consumable Transformation Item** that is typically collected in bulk rather than used individually. While it cannot be used directly from the bag to heal or buff a Pokémon, it serves as a specialized currency for biological modification.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Accessible sell price; however, these are rarely sold by players due to their high utility value in the endgame).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Normal Tera Shards are collected and taken to the **Treasure Eatery in Medali**, a chef can exchange them to change a Pokémon’s **Tera Type** to **Normal**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Meta-Defining.** The Normal Tera Type is a top-tier competitive choice in VGC and Smogon formats. It is most famously used by Pokémon like **Dragonite** to gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) on *Extreme Speed*, or by various attackers to transform into a type with only one weakness (Fighting) and a total immunity to Ghost-type moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution but is the sole mechanic for altering the **Terastal** phenomenon's output for a specific Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for defeating **Normal-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star or higher). They can also be found as sparkling dropped items throughout the Paldea region, particularly in **Area Zero**, or generated via the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Farming requires active participation in the **Tera Raid** circuit or utilizing the **Charm** (Glitterati) mechanics in the DLC to increase shard yields.
