## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LIB5685** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special, consumable event item used exclusively in the Galar Wild Area. When brought to the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone structure in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard in-game Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; effectively **Not for sale** as it is a special acquisition item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Centiskorch**—to appear as a Max Raid boss. Once activated, the raid remains available until the end of the current day (midnight).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** While the item itself has no battle effect, it is the primary method for players to guaranteed a Gigantamax Centiskorch encounter with specific IVs/Rewards, which can then be used in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts solely with the Max Raid den mechanics of the Galar region. It is immune to the effects of Pickup or Klutz as it is not a held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (LIB5685) was historically distributed as a **Special Serial Code** promotion (often through retail partnerships like GameStop or during specific movie/event tie-ins). It is not found through normal gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Wonder Card" or "Serial Code" event reward, intended to provide players access to rare Gigantamax forms outside of standard den rotations.
