## Identity & Utility
**Legendary Clue 3** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region, specifically within the Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** A handwritten note provided by the character Peony featuring a unique drawing and information regarding "bird Pokémon." It serves as a narrative guide and quest-tracker for the player's expedition. As a Key Item, it is categorized as a non-consumable utility that cannot be sold, discarded, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale/Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item functions as a quest trigger. It activates the "The Bird-Life of the Frozen Sea" legendary questline. Upon receiving or reading the clue, the Galarian variants of the Legendary Birds—**Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres**—are triggered to appear at Dyna Tree Hill, after which they roam different areas of the Galar region (the Crown Tundra, the Wild Area, and the Isle of Armor).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and story completion within the DLC campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is strictly a "Plot Advancement" tool used to facilitate the capture of specific Legendaries.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained from **Peony** at his base in Freezington after the player begins their expedition in the Crown Tundra. It is one of three initial clues handed to the player to jumpstart the "Legendary Clues" side-quests.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time acquisition provided by an NPC.
* **Context:** The "Legendary Clues" represent Peony’s enthusiasm for "adventuring" with his daughter. While the drawings are crude and the notes are informal, they provide the mechanical framework for locating the most powerful Pokémon in the Frozen North. Specifically, Clue 3 leads the player to the Dyna Tree, the focal point for the Galarian Legendary Birds' migration.
