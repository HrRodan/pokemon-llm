## Identity & Utility
**Aloraichium Z** is a **Species-Specific Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized Z-Crystal designed to harness Z-Power specifically for **Alolan Raichu**. Unlike generic Z-Crystals (like Electrium Z), it upgrades a specific move into a unique, high-powered cinematic attack. It is a **Held Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or traded while held.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; not available for purchase in any Mart).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Alolan Raichu** that knows the move **Thunderbolt**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Stoked Sparksurfer**.
    * **Stoked Sparksurfer:** A powerful Electric-type physical/special hybrid attack with a base power of **175**. Its secondary effect is a **100% chance to Paralyze** the target, making it one of the most potent utility-nuke combinations in the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed by Knock Off or stolen by Thief/Covet).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for Alolan Raichu in Generation VII formats. While Alolan Raichu often relies on its "Surge Surfer" ability in Electric Terrain, the Aloraichium Z provides a guaranteed "stop" to a threat via 100% paralysis while dealing massive damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly tied to the Alolan variant of Raichu; it has no effect on Kantonian Raichu. It cannot be used if the Pokémon is under the effect of "Klutz" or if "Embargo" is active, though the crystal itself is generally immune to most item-removal mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained as a gift from an NPC in **Seafolk Village** (on Poni Island) after showing them an Alolan Raichu.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique key-item-style held object restricted to one per save file through standard gameplay.
* **Lore context:** The crystal represents the unique adaptation of Raichu to the Alolan islands, where it gained Psychic powers and the ability to ride its tail like a surfboard via telekinesis.
