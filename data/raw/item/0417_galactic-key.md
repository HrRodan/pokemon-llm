## Identity & Utility
**Galactic-key** is a **Plot-Advancement** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized electronic card key designed to disengage high-level security systems within the Team Galactic Headquarters in Veilstone City. It is a **Key Item** that is vital for story progression and **cannot be bought, sold, or held** by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player full access to the interior of the Galactic HQ in Veilstone City, allowing them to bypass locked electronic doors to reach the higher floors and confront the organization's leadership.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for single-player campaign progression and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive format.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It interacts exclusively with the overworld environment (door triggers) within the Sinnoh region's Team Galactic facilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum* (and their remakes), this key is obtained during the infiltration of the Galactic Warehouse and HQ. It is typically found after the player has acquired the Storage Key and navigated the lower levels of the facility.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The flavor text notes that "Losing it can result in punishment," reflecting the cold, disciplined, and authoritarian internal culture established by Team Galactic's leader, Cyrus. It represents the final stage of infiltrating the organization's main base of operations before the climax at Mt. Coronet.
