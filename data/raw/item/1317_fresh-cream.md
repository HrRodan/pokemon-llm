## Identity & Utility
**Fresh Cream** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized culinary component used exclusively within the Pokémon Camp feature. It is a consumable ingredient designed to balance flavors, specifically used to add a creamy sweetness to spicy curry dishes. It is a single-use consumable that can be purchased from specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during the cooking minigame in Pokémon Sword and Shield, it serves as a key ingredient for specific recipes in the Curry Dex. It provides a "Sweet" flavor profile, which can modify the outcome of the dish and the subsequent experience (EXP), friendliness, and health restoration granted to the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect in battle and is intended for out-of-battle camp mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. It is strictly tied to the Galar region's **Curry Dex** completion.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained from **Ingredient Sellers** located throughout the Galar Wild Area and the Expansion Pass areas (Isle of Armor/Crown Tundra). Their inventory rotates daily, making the item moderately common but not always guaranteed.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability and must be purchased or received as a reward from NPCs in the Wild Area.
* **Lore Context:** Reflecting Galar's real-world inspiration (the United Kingdom), the inclusion of Fresh Cream highlights the region's focus on diverse culinary traditions and the social bond between Trainers and Pokémon through shared meals.
