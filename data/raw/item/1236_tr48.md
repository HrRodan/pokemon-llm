## Identity & Utility
**TR48 (Bulk Up)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device used to teach the move **Bulk Up**. It is a **Consumable** item that, unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, breaks after a single use. It is a mid-tier technical machine designed for physical attackers.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for TRs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Bulk Up** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Effect:** The user tenses its muscles to raise both its **Attack** and **Defense** stats by one stage each.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; generally not used for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Bulk Up is a premier "set-up" move for physical sweepers and tanks. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like Corviknight, Urshifu, and Buzzwole to increase longevity against physical hits while simultaneously building offensive pressure.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. As a TR, it is governed by the Gen VIII mechanic where machines are consumable, requiring the player to farm multiple copies for different team members.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR48 is primarily acquired through **Max Raid Battles** (typically against Fighting-type Pokémon) or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts rather than standard currency. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Most effectively gathered via consistent participation in the **Max Raid** ecosystem or checking daily rotations of the Wild Area merchants.
