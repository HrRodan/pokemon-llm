## Identity & Utility
**Gastly Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutrient packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically for the Gastly evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used from the bag to permanently enhance a Pokémon's potential.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low purchase/resale value, its utility lies in its specialized stat-boosting properties rather than its economic worth.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a member of the **Gastly, Haunter, or Gengar** family, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **+1 Awakening Value (AV)** simultaneously.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a mechanical ecosystem where the move Fling is not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. In those games, it is essential for "maxing out" a Gengar to its peak performance (up to 200 AVs per stat), making it mandatory for high-level Master Trainers or local competitive play within that engine. It has no effect in standard VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution; however, it is the most efficient way to raise the stats of a **Gengar** compared to using generic candies (like Courage or Quick Candies), which only raise one stat at a time.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily through the **Pokémon Storage System** mechanics. Players receive these candies by transferring caught Gastly, Haunter, or Gengar to Professor Oak. They are also frequently rewarded for achieving high **Catch Combos** of the Gastly line in locations like the Pokémon Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through gameplay loops such as the **Poké Ball Plus** (strolling with a Gastly) or as rewards for species-specific challenges. 
* **Lore Context:** These candies represent the concentrated essence or "research data" of a specific species, allowing a trainer to bolster the natural strengths of that specific evolutionary family.
