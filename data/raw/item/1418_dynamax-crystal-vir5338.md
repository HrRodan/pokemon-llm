## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (VIR5338)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that is not typically available through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal; though primarily obtained via serial codes or special distributions rather than shop purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this item at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific Pokémon Den in the Galar Wild Area) triggers a Max Raid Battle. The encounter is fixed to a specific Pokémon species (determined by the VIR5338 ID) and remains active until defeated or until the day ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item used solely for capturing Pokémon, farming Exp. Candies, or obtaining Pokémon with Hidden Abilities/Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but often provides access to Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which allows them to change form when Dynamaxing.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are typically **Event-Only** items distributed via serial codes from retailers (such as GameStop or GAME) or as bonuses for purchasing specific guidebooks or expansion passes. They are not sold by standard Mart NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Acquisition" item, meant to facilitate rare encounters outside of the standard Max Raid rotation.
