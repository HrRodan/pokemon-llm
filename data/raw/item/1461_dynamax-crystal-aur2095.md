## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AUR2095** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used within the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It is a single-use consumable that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at a designated location. It cannot be used in battle and is not a standard hold item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but effectively priceless as it is an event-exclusive distribution item not found in standard shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty Pokémon Den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal can be consumed to instantly trigger a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This raid persists until the end of the calendar day. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Utility Only).** While the crystal itself has no battle effect, these items were historically used to give players access to rare Pokémon with **Gigantamax factors**, specific Hidden Abilities, or high IV spreads, which are critical for building VGC or Smogon competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions exclusively as a "summoning" mechanic for the Max Raid Den system in Galar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal gameplay. It was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail promotions (such as those at GameStop or Pokémon Center events). Despite the 20 Poké Dollar price tag in the code, it is not sold at any Poké Mart or by the Watt Traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-exclusive event item.
* **Context:** The "AUR" prefix in the internal name typically denotes a specific promotional event. Using this item allows the player to bypass the RNG of Den spawns and Wishing Pieces to face a guaranteed high-value encounter.
