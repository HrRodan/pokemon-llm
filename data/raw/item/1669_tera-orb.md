## Identity & Utility
**Tera-orb** is a **Key Item** (classified as an event-item in raw data) introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The Tera Orb is a specialized device used to harness Terastal energy. It allows a Trainer to Terastallize one Pokémon per battle, transforming its type into its "Tera Type" and providing offensive and defensive strategic shifts. As a Key Item, it is **not consumable** and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated in battle, the Tera Orb triggers the **Terastal phenomenon**. This changes the Pokémon's current type to its innate Tera Type, boosts the power of moves matching that Tera Type (STAB), and grants a massive power spike to the move "Tera Blast." 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Recharge Mechanic:** Unlike Mega Evolution, the Tera Orb loses its charge after a single use. It must be recharged by visiting a Pokémon Center or by touching glowing Tera Crystals found in the overworld of the Paldea region.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Defining Staple.** In Generation IX competitive play (VGC and Smogon), the Tera Orb is the central mechanic of every match. It is used to flip type advantages (e.g., turning a Water-type into a Grass-type to resist Electric moves) or to provide overwhelming offensive pressure.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but it is the only way to activate the **Stellar Tera Type** or utilize the signature powers of the legendary Pokémon **Terapagos**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a story-essential item. In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, it is gifted to the player early in the game by Nemona on behalf of the Naranja/Uva Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique technology developed within the Paldea region, specifically linked to the energy originating from **Area Zero (The Great Crater of Paldea)**.
* **World Context:** While the JSON categorizes it under "event-items," it functions mechanically as a **Key Item** that stays in the player's Bag permanently once acquired. It represents the "gimmick" of its generation, similar to the Mega Ring or Z-Power Ring.
