## Identity & Utility
**Rufflet Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A feather shed by the Rufflet evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. Unlike traditional items, it is not used directly on a Pokémon or held in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Standard Material Value**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific component required to craft certain Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. It is consumed upon use at the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Applications:** Based on world knowledge of Gen IX mechanics, Rufflet Feathers are typically required for Flying-type or physical-focused TMs such as:
    * **TM097 (Fly)**
    * **TM113 (Tailwind)**
    * **TM164 (Brave Bird)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials generally cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely within the crafting economy and has no tactical application in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with abilities like Pickup. It is categorized strictly as a resource for the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching members of the Rufflet evolutionary line in the wild. It is also frequently gathered through the **"Let's Go!"** auto-battle mechanic.
* **Wild Source:** Dropped exclusively by:
    * **Rufflet**
    * **Braviary** (including its Hisuian form if encountered in a compatible Gen IX context)
* **Lore context:** Feathers from the Rufflet line are known for their resilience and are sought after for their connection to high-speed aerial maneuvers, explaining their use in crafting TMs related to flight and wind.
