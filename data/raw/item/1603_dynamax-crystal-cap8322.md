## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Cap8322** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used specifically in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it triggers a special Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal ID `cap8322`). It is a single-use consumable that remains active until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically **Cheap**, though effectively **Not for sale** as it is an event-exclusive distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone den in the Watchtower Ruins) causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear as a Max Raid encounter. The encounter is guaranteed regardless of the current weather or naturally occurring dens.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) purposes to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon, often with hidden abilities or G-Max factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is functionally a "key" to unlock a specific encounter rather than an item that interacts with a Pokémon's stats or growth directly.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was not available through standard gameplay or Pokémon Marts. It was distributed via **Serial Codes** provided during special retail promotions or as pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* expansion pass or specific movie/merchandise tie-ins. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a high-value event distribution item, intended to drive community engagement and specific promotional "Max Raid" events.
* **Context:** In the Galar region, these crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles that can force a Den to become active, acting as a manual trigger for the Dynamax phenomenon outside of the natural "Wishing Piece" mechanics.
