## Identity & Utility
**Electrium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** A crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Electric-type move, it allows the user to upgrade those moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; traditionally obtained via trial completion rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it enables the user to perform the Electric-type Z-Move, **Gigavolt Havoc**, provided the Pokémon has a damaging Electric-type move in its moveset. The power of the Z-Move scales based on the base power of the original move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Staple (Gen VII context).** In Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, Electrium Z was a premier choice for offensive Electric types like **Tapu Koko**, **Xurkitree**, and **Alolan Raichu**. It provides a one-time high-damage nuke to bypass defensive walls. 
    * **Z-Status Effects:** If used with an Electric-type status move (e.g., *Thunder Wave*, *Electric Terrain*), it grants a "Z-Power" boost, such as clearing the user's lowered stats or boosting Speed, in addition to the move's normal effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is **un-knock-offable**. It cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen via *Thief* or *Covet*, or traded via *Trick* or *Switcheroo* if the holder can make use of the crystal. It does not evolve any Pokémon but is required for specific Z-Move animations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Alola region, this crystal is awarded to the player by **Sophocles** after completing the trial at the **Hokulani Observatory**. It is a unique item that remains in the player's inventory across use.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a Key-like Held Item that is tied to the trainer's **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring**. Unlike standard consumable items, it is not consumed after use in battle; the Z-Power is simply depleted for the remainder of that specific encounter.
