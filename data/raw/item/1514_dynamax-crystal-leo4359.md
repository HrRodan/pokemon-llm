## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Leo4359)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use, consumable event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. While the flavor text uses a placeholder `[VAR (0000)]`, these "Leo" series crystals were historically distributed via serial codes (often through retail partnerships or pre-order bonuses) to grant access to rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic/Cheap). Though it has a technical price in the code, it is **not for sale** in standard Poké Marts and is obtained through special external distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a beam of light will appear. This initiates a **Max Raid Battle** against a specific Pokémon. The raid remains active until the battle is won or until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item used in the overworld to facilitate an encounter. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess **Hidden Abilities** or **Gigantamax Factors**, making the results of the crystal highly relevant for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in Galar. It cannot be used if a raid is already active at that specific location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event-Exclusive Distribution**. It was typically provided as a "Mystery Gift" serial code via retailers (such as GameStop, GAME, or Best Buy) or as a bonus for purchasing specific guidebooks or expansion pass bundles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are concentrated shards of Galar Particle energy that "summon" a specific entity from the Power Spots beneath the earth, allowing Trainers to force an encounter that would otherwise rely on the RNG of a standard Wishing Piece.
