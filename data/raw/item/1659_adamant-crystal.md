## Identity & Utility
**Adamant Crystal** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
*   **Description:** A large, glowing crystal that radiates the power of time. It is a specialized **Key Item** and **Form-Change Item** specifically tied to the Legendary Pokémon Dialga. It cannot be bought or sold.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When used on or held by **Dialga**, it triggers a transformation into **Dialga (Origin Forme)**. In games where it functions as a held item (such as Pokémon Scarlet and Violet), it also boosts the power of Dialga's **Steel-type** and **Dragon-type** moves by **20%**.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    *   **Competitive Use:** This is a mandatory item for players wishing to use **Origin Forme Dialga**. While the 20% damage boost is identical to the traditional *Adamant Orb*, the primary draw is the stat redistribution and aesthetic change of the Origin Forme. It is used in Restricted Legendary formats (VGC) and high-tier Smogon formats (Ubers).
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the Adamant Orb, which is a standard held item, the Adamant Crystal is treated as a Key Item in *Legends: Arceus* to facilitate form switching outside of battle. In traditional mainline entries, it occupies the held item slot.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** 
    *   **Pokémon Legends: Arceus:** Rewarded to the player by **Adaman** of the Diamond Clan after completing Request 102: "The Tale of Her Across the Sea" (post-game).
    *   **Pokémon Scarlet/Violet:** Obtainable via the **Auction House in Porto Marinada** if the player has a Dialga in their party or boxes.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a singular, legendary artifact representing the core essence of Dialga's power over time.
*   **Lore:** The crystal is said to be a crystallized fragment of time itself, used by the Diamond Clan to honor "Sinnoh," the creator. It allows Dialga to assume the form it held when the world was first created at the Spear Pillar.
