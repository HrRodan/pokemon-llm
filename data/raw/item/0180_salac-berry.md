## Identity & Utility
**Salac Berry** is a **Stat-Boosting Berry** (specifically categorized as an "in-a-pinch" item) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A rare, holdable berry that triggers a secondary effect when the user's health is low. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically priced cheaply but is rarely available for direct purchase in most regions.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Special acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **1/4 (25%) or less** of its maximum, the berry is consumed to **increase the holder's Speed stat by one stage**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the Speed boost effect on the target).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fighting-type** attack with **100 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for "Sub-Salac" sets. It is frequently paired with the move **Substitute** to safely lower HP to the 25% threshold, allowing a sweeper to outspeed the opponent's team. It is particularly potent on Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (which doubles Speed when an item is consumed) or **Gluttony** (which allows the berry to activate at 50% HP).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It can be harvested repeatedly using the **Harvest** ability or retrieved using **Recycle**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically rare and not found in standard Poké Marts. It is usually obtained as a high-tier prize in **Battle Facilities** (like the Battle Frontier or Battle Maison), via the **Berry Master**, or through complex Berry mutations in Gen VI.
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is **not typically found** on wild Pokémon, making cultivation via soil and mulch the primary method of replenishment. Its rarity in the world lore suggests it is a prize for high-level trainers rather than a common forageable.
