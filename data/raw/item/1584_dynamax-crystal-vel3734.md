## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (vel3734)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-based consumable used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It is a single-use key-style item that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. While it has a technical cost associated with it, it is not found in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but practically **Not for sale**; distributed via serial codes or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive den in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, associated with the internal ID **vel3734**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. This encounter remains active until the end of the calendar day.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough.** These crystals are primarily used to obtain specific Pokémon with hidden abilities, rare Gigantamax forms, or version-exclusive species that may be required for a competitive team, but the item itself holds no value in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Triggers a **Max Raid Battle**, allowing the player and up to three others to battle and potentially catch the summoned Pokémon. It does not directly evolve Pokémon but is a primary method for obtaining **Gigantamax-capable** specimens.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event Exclusive**. Dynamax Crystals were historically distributed through retail partnerships (like GameStop or Target) and special edition purchases (such as the Sword & Shield Dual Pack).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via the **Mystery Gift** function as a promotional reward.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique location in the Galar region's Wild Area where these artificial or rare crystals can react with Power Spots to manifest specific Dynamax phenomena on command.
