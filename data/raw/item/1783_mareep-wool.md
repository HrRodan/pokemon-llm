## Identity & Utility
**Mareep Wool** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of soft, high-quality wool shed or harvested from members of the Mareep evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold or exchanged at the TM Machine. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for an effect.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**; primarily used as currency for League Points or as a crafting ingredient).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials are stored in the "TM Materials" pocket and cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly restricted to out-of-battle movepool expansion by allowing the player to create TMs for Electric-type moves (such as *TM048 Volt Switch* or *TM023 Charge Beam*).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the Mareep line and serves as a modular component in the Gen IX crafting economy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Mareep family. It is also a potential reward from Tera Raid Battles featuring these Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not held as an item to be stolen with *Thief*, it is consistently dropped by wild **Mareep**, **Flaaffy**, and **Ampharos**. In the Paldea region, players typically farm this item in grassy areas where Mareep flocks congregate to gather the necessary materials for Electric-type move customization.
