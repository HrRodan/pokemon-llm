## Identity & Utility
**Adamant Orb** is a species-specific held item introduced in **Generation IV** (the Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A brightly gleaming orb specifically designed for Dialga. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that cannot be bought, functioning as a unique signature artifact that enhances the natural temporal powers of the Legendary Pokémon of Time. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically acquired via story progression or special events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by **Dialga**, the power of its **Dragon-type** and **Steel-type** moves is increased by **20% (1.2× power)**. This boost stacks with Dialga's Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB), significantly increasing the damage output of moves like *Flash Cannon* and *Roar of Time*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Base power damage; however, flinging this item is highly discouraged as it is rare and consumes the item).
    * **Competitive Use:** A staple for Dialga in **Ubers** and **VGC Restricted** formats. It is often preferred over *Life Orb* because it provides a significant damage boost to Dialga's primary attacking types without the 10% recoil damage, preserving Dialga's natural bulk.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Creation Trio" set, alongside the Lustrous Orb (Palkia) and the Griseous Orb (Giratina). In modern generations (Gen VIII onwards), it is distinguished from the *Adamant Crystal*, which is used to transform Dialga into its Origin Forme.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally found at **Spear Pillar** or deep within **Mt. Coronet** after the player encounters Dialga. In subsequent games, it is usually gifted to the player by NPCs (such as the treasure hunter in Stow-on-Side in Galar or the Porto Marinada auction house in Paldea) once Dialga is in the player's possession.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is treated as a unique legendary artifact.
