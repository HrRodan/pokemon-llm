## Identity & Utility
**Icium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon with an Ice-type move in its repertoire, it allows the use of the corresponding Z-Move. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Not for sale** (Cost: 0).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Key Item property).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, this item grants the holder the ability to upgrade its Ice-type attacking moves into the powerful Z-Move **Subzero Slammer**, provided the Trainer has the Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring.
* **Secondary Mechanics:**
    * **Z-Status Moves:** If the holder uses a Status move like *Haze* or *Mist* while holding Icium Z, it triggers a Z-Status effect (e.g., Z-Haze fully restores the user's HP in addition to resetting stat changes).
    * **Item Protection:** As a Z-Crystal, this item cannot be removed, stolen, or traded away during battle via moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats. It is frequently used to provide a one-time "nuke" to bypass defensive walls. Common users include Kyurem-Black (to utilize a powerful physical Ice move) and various Ice-type attackers in the VGC 2017/2018 formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is unaffected by the ability **Klutz** (the Pokémon still cannot use the Z-Move, but the item cannot be removed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained at **Mount Lanakila** on Ula'ula Island, typically right before the player reaches the Pokémon League.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item obtained through story progression and cannot be mass-farmed.
* **Lore context:** The Icium Z represents the trial of the mountain and the mastery of the harsh, cold environments of the Alola region. Unlike most held items, it does not get consumed after use, though the Z-Move itself can only be performed once per battle.
