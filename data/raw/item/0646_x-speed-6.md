## Identity & Utility
**X-Speed-6** is a **Miracle-Shooter** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** An enhanced version of the standard X Speed, specifically designed for use within the Wonder Launcher (Miracle Shooter) battle system. It is a consumable battle item that **cannot** be purchased in Poké Marts or used in standard overworld gameplay.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via point accumulation in specific battle modes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon during battle, it raises the target’s **Speed stat by six stages**. This effectively quadruples the Pokémon's Speed (+400%), maximizing the stat modifier in a single turn. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Mechanic-Locked.** This item is entirely restricted to the "Wonder Launcher" (Miracle Shooter) format in Generation V multiplayer. It is not legal in standard VGC, Smogon, or modern competitive formats. It is considered an "extreme" buff intended to swing the momentum of a match instantly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no effect on Pokémon evolution. As a stat-stage modifier, the effect is lost immediately if the Pokémon is switched out or the battle ends.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. During wireless battles where the Wonder Launcher is enabled, players earn "Points" each turn; X-Speed-6 is one of the high-cost tactical options players can "buy" mid-battle using these points.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a digital construct of the Unova battle sub-systems rather than a physical item found in the game world.
