## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (SCO5984)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable event item designed for use in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the day. It functions as a "summoning" tool for rare or promotional Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inexpensive**, though effectively **Priceless/Event-only** as it cannot be purchased from standard in-game NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area), the crystal causes a specific Pokémon—traditionally a **Gigantamax Corviknight** for this specific serial code—to appear as a Max Raid boss.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate an encounter; it provides no benefit in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but provides access to Gigantamax-capable species that are otherwise difficult to locate in the wild.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **special serial codes** provided by retailers (such as the Pokémon Center or physical game stores) as a promotional bonus. It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to the Galar region's Max Raid mechanic and event distribution history.
