## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PEG8781** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A specific event-trigger item used to facilitate a Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear. It is a **Consumable Encounter Item** that is technically priced at 20 Poké Dollars, though it is never found in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**; usually obtained via serial codes rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal activates a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is a field-use item only).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) raid encounters to obtain specific Pokémon, often with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or the Gigantamax factor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (PEG8781) was historically associated with the distribution for **Gigantamax Copperajah**. Once the raid is completed, the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal gameplay. It was distributed via **special serial codes** provided by retailers (such as GameStop or EB Games) or through promotional events. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a "Special Acquisition" item meant to bridge real-world promotions with in-game encounters.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique, otherwise dormant Power Spot that only reacts to these manufactured or rare crystals, allowing trainers to summon specific powerful entities on demand.
