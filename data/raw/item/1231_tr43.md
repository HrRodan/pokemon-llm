## Identity & Utility
**TR43 (Overheat)** is a **Technical Record** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Overheat**. Unlike TMs (Technical Machines) in the Galar region, TRs are consumed upon use, representing a return to the classic "disposable" move-teaching mechanic. 
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Overheat**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Overheat is a high-power Fire-type Special move (130 Power / 90% Accuracy). Its mechanical drawback is that it "harshly lowers" the user's Special Attack stat by two stages (-2) after use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 130 (Extremely high). While TRs are rarely used for the move **Fling**, TR43 provides one of the highest possible damage outputs for the move, though at the cost of the move-teaching utility.
    * **Competitive Use:** Overheat is a **Competitive Staple**. It is the premier choice for Special Attackers needing immediate Fire-type burst damage. It is frequently seen on "Hit and Run" sets or on Pokémon holding an **Eject Pack**, which triggers an immediate switch-out when the stat drop occurs, resetting the penalty.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Fire-type Pokémon and high-tier Special Attackers across various types for coverage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR43 is primarily acquired by defeating Fire-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price in Watts (usually 3,000–8,000 W depending on the vendor rotation).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively obtained through raid rewards or specialized currency exchange, marking it as a high-tier reward for dedicated trainers.
