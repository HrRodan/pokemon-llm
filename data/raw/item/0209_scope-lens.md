## Identity & Utility
**Scope Lens** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An optical tool designed to pinpoint an opponent's weak spots. It is a permanent **Held Item** that is active during battle. While it can be bought in specific markets or battle facilities, it is typically treated as a specialized tactical attachment rather than a consumable.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive/Mid-tier).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the holder's **critical hit ratio by one stage** (+1). In modern mechanics, this typically raises the base critical hit chance from 4.17% (1/24) to 12.5% (1/8).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **Niche Competitive Item**. It is most effective when stacked with other critical-hit modifiers. Common synergies include:
        * **Abilities:** Pairs exceptionally well with **Super Luck** (e.g., Honchkrow, Togekiss) to reach high crit thresholds.
        * **Moves:** When used with "High Critical Hit Ratio" moves (like Leaf Blade, Stone Edge, or Sniper-boosted attacks), it significantly increases reliability.
        * **The "Crit-Me-Not" Strategy:** Often used alongside *Focus Energy* to guarantee 100% critical hits, allowing the user to bypass an opponent's defensive stat boosts or Screens (Reflect/Light Screen).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely functional for battle performance and is unaffected by mechanics that specifically target consumable berries.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired in mid-to-late game locations or purchased via Battle Points (BP) in various Battle Facilities (such as the Battle Frontier or Battle Maison). Its 4000 Poké Dollar price tag reflects its status as a professional-grade combat tool.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held by any wild Pokémon** in standard encounters. It must typically be found as a fixed item ball on the ground or obtained through special shops, making it rarer than items gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
