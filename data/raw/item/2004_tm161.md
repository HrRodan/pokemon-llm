## Identity & Utility
**TM161 (Trick Room)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current numbering during **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that provides a Pokémon with the move **Trick Room**. As a modern TM, it is a single-use consumable in Generation IX, though it can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **LP (League Points)** and materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Trick Room**. When used in battle, Trick Room creates a bizarre dimension for five turns. While active, Pokémon with lower Speed stats move before Pokémon with higher Speed stats within the same priority bracket.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in the current generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Archetypal Staple.** TM161 is the cornerstone of "Trick Room" teams in both VGC and Smogon formats. It allows slow, bulky powerhouses (like Ursaluna, Iron Hands, or Torkoal) to outspeed and dominate faster, more fragile "hyper-offense" threats. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used by bulky Psychic or Ghost-type "setters" (e.g., Cresselia, Farigiraf, Hatterene) to alter the field conditions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, this TM can be crafted at any **TM Machine** located at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Crafting Requirements:**
    * **5,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Bronzor Fragments**
    * **3x Petilil Leaf**
    * **3x Gothita Eyelash**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; the components required to craft it are gathered by defeating wild **Bronzor**, **Petilil**, and **Gothita** lines, often optimized via the **Let's Go!** auto-battle mechanic.
