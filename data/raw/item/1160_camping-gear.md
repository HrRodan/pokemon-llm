## Identity & Utility
**Camping Gear** is a **Gameplay / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A comprehensive kit containing a tent, cooking supplies, and recreation tools. It is a permanent **Key Item** used to access the "Pokémon Camp" feature while exploring the Galar region. It cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story-related acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the overworld (specifically in the Wild Area, routes, or designated camping spots), it initiates **Pokémon Camp**. This allows the player to interact with their party to increase **Friendship** and **Affection** levels through playing and talking.
* **Cooking Sub-mechanic:** The gear is the primary tool for the **Curry Dex**. Cooking curry using various berries and ingredients restores the HP, PP, and status conditions of the entire party. It also provides a significant boost to Pokémon Experience Points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld and party management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** By raising Affection levels through Camping Gear use, players can trigger specific evolutions (e.g., **Sylveon**) or benefit from "Affection Bonuses" in single-player battles (such as surviving lethal hits with 1 HP or increased critical hit ratios).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically obtained as a gift from the player's mother early in the story of *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*, just before the player first enters the Wild Area.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. It is a unique piece of equipment that defines the Galar region's emphasis on bond-building and outdoor exploration. In a **Nuzlocke** context, this item is a critical resource for free, party-wide healing without consuming traditional medicine like Potions or Revives.
