## Identity & Utility
**Gracidea** is an **Event-Linked Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A symbolic flower often bundled in bouquets to express gratitude on special occasions. It functions as a specialized **Form-Change Trigger** for the Mythical Pokémon Shaymin. It is a permanent Key Item that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Shaymin in the party, it transforms the Pokémon from its **Land Forme** (Grass-type) into its **Sky Forme** (Grass/Flying-type). 
* **Mechanical Restrictions:**
    * **Time of Day:** The transformation can only be triggered during the **daytime**.
    * **Status Condition:** The item will fail if used on a Shaymin that is currently **Frozen**.
    * **Reversion:** Shaymin-Sky will automatically revert to Land Forme if it is deposited in a PC (in older generations), during the night, if it becomes frozen during a battle, or upon entering certain multiplayer/link battle formats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself is not a held item, it is the sole gatekeeper to **Shaymin-Sky**. In competitive play (such as Smogon's Ubers tier), Shaymin-Sky is a top-tier threat due to its high Speed and the *Serene Grace* ability, which doubles the flinch chance of *Air Slash*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon; it serves strictly as a **Forme Change** mechanism.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via a specific NPC interaction. In its debut (Sinnoh), a woman in **Floaroma Town** grants the player the Gracidea if they have a fateful-encounter Shaymin in their party. In later titles (like *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* or *BDSP*), it is given by NPCs upon showing them a Shaymin.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally tied to "Event" distributions of Shaymin, making it a rare commemorative item in the player's inventory.
* **Lore context:** The flower is deeply tied to the "Gratitude Pokémon" mythos; legend says that Shaymin take to the sky to find new blooming Gracidea patches, signaling a change of seasons and the spread of gratitude across the land.
