## Identity & Utility
**TM159 (Acrobatics)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration during **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that grants a Pokémon the move **Acrobatics**. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine. As a Technical Machine, it cannot be held for a battle effect but is essential for move-pool customization.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using **5,000 LP**, **3x Wattrel Feathers**, and **3x Bombirdier Feathers**.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently teaches the move **Acrobatics** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Details:** Acrobatics is a Flying-type Physical move with a base power of 55. If the user is **not holding an item**, the base power doubles to **110**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Viability/Staple.** Acrobatics is a premier choice for "Unburden" ability users (like Sneasler or Hawlucha) and Pokémon utilizing "Booster Energy" (like Roaring Moon or Iron Valiant). Once the held item is consumed or lost, the move becomes one of the most efficient Flying-type attacks in the game due to its high power and lack of recoil.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is a key component of strategies involving the **Consumption** of items (Seeds, Berries, or Gems) to maximize damage output.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically added as part of the **Indigo Disk (Generation IX DLC)** expansion. It can be found as a physical item on the ground within the **Terarium** or unlocked for crafting at any TM Machine after the player has obtained it once or progressed through the DLC story.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. The materials required to craft it (Wattrel Feathers and Bombirdier Feathers) must be gathered by defeating or catching wild **Wattrel/Kilowattrel** and **Bombirdier**.
