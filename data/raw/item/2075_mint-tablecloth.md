## Identity & Utility
**Mint-tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative item used to customize the player's picnic set. It changes the visual aesthetic of the table during the picnic mechanic, where players breed Pokémon and create Sandwiches. It is a **Reusable Utility** item that can be purchased and swapped at will to personalize the overworld experience.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a **Picnic** in the overworld, they can interact with the table to change its appearance. Selecting the Mint Tablecloth applies a mint-colored pattern to the picnic table. This effect is purely cosmetic and does not influence Sandwich meal powers or egg production rates.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the "Picnic" feature in the Paldea region and provides no tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. It is part of the generation-specific customization system for the Scarlet/Violet camping-equivalent mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Picnic Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced consumer good in the Pokémon world rather than a natural resource. 
* **Context:** In the Paldean economy, the Mint Tablecloth is part of a wider variety of "Knacks" intended to enhance the social experience of traveling with Pokémon, emphasizing the lifestyle and bonding aspects of the ninth generation.
