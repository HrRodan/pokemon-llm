## Identity & Utility
**Flying Gem** is a **Jewel (Single-use Held Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An elemental jewel imbued with the essence of air. When held by a Pokémon, it provides a one-time power boost to a Flying-type attack. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically priced at 200 Poké Dollars, though it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically found through exploration.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, but acquisition is usually restricted to special mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Flying-type move, the move’s power is increased by **1.5×** (in Gen V) or **1.3×** (in Gen VI and onward). The item is consumed immediately upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item is typically consumed by the user's own move before Fling can be used; if forced, it has minimal impact).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **high-tier competitive staple** in Generation V. It is most famous for its synergy with the move **Acrobatics**. Because the Gem is consumed before the move deals damage, Acrobatics receives both the Gem's 1.5× multiplier and its own 2× multiplier for the user not holding an item, resulting in massive burst damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Unburden:** Consuming the Flying Gem immediately activates the **Unburden** ability, doubling the user's Speed.
    * **Acrobatics Synergy:** This is the premier item for physical Flying-type attackers like Archeops, Hawlucha, or Talonflame (in Gen V contexts).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut generation (Black/White/B2W2), Flying Gems were primarily farmed via **Dust Clouds** in caves (Wellspring Cave, Chargestone Cave, etc.). In later generations, elemental gems became significantly harder to obtain, often being restricted to special events or specific battle facility rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon in the current database. It is generally acquired through geological phenomena (Dust Clouds) rather than biological sources.
* **Legacy Status:** Post-Generation V, the Flying Gem (along with most elemental gems) was nerfed from 1.5× to 1.3× and largely removed from standard competitive play, making it a "Legacy" item in the eyes of many modern VGC/Smogon players.
