## Identity & Utility
**Bread** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An edible cooking component used exclusively during Pokémon Camp. It is described as an indispensable tool for mopping up leftover sauce. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought from specialized vendors.
* **Cost:** 150 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a primary ingredient in the **Curry Dex** mechanic. When cooked with berries at a Pokémon Camp, it results in various tiers of **Bread Curry**. Successful cooking restores Pokémon HP, PP, and increases Friendliness/sociability levels.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect and is purely for out-of-battle party maintenance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the Galar region's **Cooking** mini-game, providing a specific flavor profile for the Curry Dex completion.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from **Ingredients Sellers** found throughout the **Galar Wild Area**, Isle of Armor, and Crown Tundra. It may also be received as a reward from NPCs after participating in a Curry cooking session at their camps.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, Bread must be acquired through commerce or exploration rather than through the **Pickup** ability or farming wild encounters.
