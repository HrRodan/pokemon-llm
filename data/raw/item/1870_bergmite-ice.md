## Identity & Utility
**Bergmite Ice** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fragment of ice shed by a Bergmite. It is a specialized crafting resource used primarily at the TM Machine found in Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Once used, the material is consumed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on combat stats or mechanics. Its value lies entirely in the "out-of-battle" preparation phase for teaching competitive moves to a team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for Pokémon evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM crafting system. It is commonly required for high-tier Ice-type moves such as:
    * **Ice Spinner** (TM124)
    * **Ice Beam** (TM135)
    * **Blizzard** (TM143)

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop by defeating or catching members of the Bergmite evolutionary line in the wild.
* **Wild Drops:** Dropped by wild **Bergmite**, **Avalugg**, and **Hisuian Avalugg**. While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense of previous generations, it is automatically added to the player's inventory upon successful encounters with these Pokémon in the Paldea region and the Terarium.
