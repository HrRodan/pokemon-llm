## Identity & Utility
**Lustrous Orb** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A beautifully glowing, iridescent orb specifically designed for the Legendary Pokémon **Palkia**. It acts as a specialized catalyst to augment Palkia's spatial powers. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; typically found through world exploration or at legendary encounter sites).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Palkia**, the power of its **Dragon-type** and **Water-type** moves is increased by **20% (1.2× multiplier)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Standard physical damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-utility item for Palkia in **Ubers** and **Restricted VGC** formats. While it provides a lower damage boost than a Life Orb (30%), it is often preferred because it carries **no recoil damage** and does not lock the user into a single move like Choice items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * This item is specific to Palkia; it provides no benefit to any other Pokémon. 
    * In **Pokémon Legends: Arceus** and later generations, it is related to the **Lustrous Globe**, which allows Palkia to transform into its **Origin Forme**. The Orb specifically maintains the standard Forme's power.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found at locations tied to the Sinnoh myths, such as the **Spear Pillar** or **Mount Coronet** in *Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, or the **Lake of Outrage** in *Sword and Shield*. In most games, it is obtained shortly after or during the encounter with Palkia.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any common wild Pokémon; it is a unique "one-per-save-file" item associated exclusively with the Master of Space.
