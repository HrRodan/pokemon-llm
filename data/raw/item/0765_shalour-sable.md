## Identity & Utility
**Shalour Sablé** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos).
* **Description:** A famous regional specialty shortbread originating from Shalour City. It functions as a versatile medical restorative that can be used both in and out of battle to treat a Pokémon's ailments. It is a consumable item that is generally purchasable at specific specialty vendors.
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). It is notably more cost-effective than a standard Full Heal, which typically retails for 400–600 Poké Dollars.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Fully cures a single Pokémon of any major status ailment (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep) as well as Confusion.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Staple.** Like other regional specialties (e.g., Lava Cookie, Old Gateau), it is highly valued in Nuzlocke runs as an efficient, low-cost alternative to Full Heals. It has no utility in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) where bag items are prohibited.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Regional Specialty" item group, which includes items like the Casteliacone and Lumiose Galette, all of which share the "Full Heal" mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally sold at the Shalour City Gym in the Kalos region. In later generations, it is often available through specialized vendors, such as the lady in the Konikoni City market (Alola) or as rewards from high-tier battle facilities like the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. 
* **Lore:** The Shalour Sablé is treated as a piece of "culinary world-building," representing the local culture of the Kalos region. Its high effectiveness is attributed to the quality of the local shortbread recipe, making it a "famous" souvenir for travelers.
