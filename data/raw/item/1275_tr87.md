## Identity & Utility
**TR87** is a **Technical Record** (Consumable Machine) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records break after one use. TR87 specifically teaches the move **Drill Run**.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive/Mid-tier). While it has a high monetary value, it is more commonly acquired through the Watt economy in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Drill Run** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile (Drill Run):** A Physical Ground-type attack with 80 Base Power and 95% Accuracy. It features an increased critical-hit ratio, making it highly effective against defensive setups.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High). When used with the move Fling, it deals significant physical damage but consumes the item.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Drill Run is a vital Ground-type coverage move. It is often the primary choice for Pokémon that cannot learn Earthquake (e.g., Beedrill, Escavalier, or Rapidash) or for those that need a single-target Ground move in VGC to avoid hitting allies or being weakened by Grassy Terrain.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon successful teaching of the move.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR87 is primarily obtained as a reward for defeating Ground-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price of Watts (typically between 2,000 to 5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively acquired through Galar-specific infrastructure (Raids/Watt Traders).
* **Context:** The move taught by TR87, Drill Run, was previously a signature move of the Excadrill line and a Move Tutor exclusive in earlier generations; its availability as a TR significantly expanded the coverage options for Physical attackers in the Gen VIII meta.
