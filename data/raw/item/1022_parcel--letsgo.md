## Identity & Utility
**Oak's Parcel (Let's Go Edition)** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized delivery package meant for Professor Oak. It serves as the primary "quest trigger" for the early game, moving the player from the tutorial phase into the main adventure. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When delivered to Professor Oak in his Lab in Pallet Town, it advances the storyline. In the *Let's Go* series, this delivery typically results in the player receiving **Razz Berries** and the **Pokédex**, officially starting the journey.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for narrative progression and has no utility in competitive battling or VGC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is strictly a delivery objective.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically from the **Poké Mart Clerk in Viridian City**. The clerk tasks the player with returning the package to Pallet Town because the Professor is expecting it.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **World Knowledge:** This is a modern iteration of the "Oak's Parcel" from the original Generation I games. While the mechanics remain the same—acting as a gatekeeper for the Pokédex—its presence in the *Let's Go* data reflects the updated quest flow of the Kanto remakes.
