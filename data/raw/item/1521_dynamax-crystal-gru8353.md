## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal GRU8353** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed to interact with the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Wild Area (Ruins of Watchtower) of the Galar region. Using it causes a specific Pokémon to appear in a Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that is not found in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**). While it has a nominal internal cost value, it is not a commodity that can be purchased through normal gameplay.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a **Max Raid Battle** beacon. The specific Pokémon summoned is determined by the alphanumeric code of the crystal (in this case, GRU8353). The encounter remains active until the player defeats the Pokémon or until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** The crystal itself has no combat application. However, it is highly valuable for competitive players as these crystals often guarantee encounters with Pokémon possessing **Hidden Abilities (HA)**, high Individual Values (IVs), or Gigantamax factors necessary for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid beacon at the specific ruins.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** as part of real-world promotions (such as retail distributions at GameStop/Target, pre-order bonuses, or magazine inserts like CoroCoro). It is not available through standard Marts or in-game NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a promotional distribution item used to bridge real-world events with in-game encounters.
