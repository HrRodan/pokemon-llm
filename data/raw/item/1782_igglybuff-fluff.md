## Identity & Utility
**Igglybuff Fluff** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A crafting component dropped by the Igglybuff evolutionary line. It represents a small tuft of soft material shed by the Pokémon. As a TM Material, it is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine in Pokémon Centers. 
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Accessible; more commonly exchanged for League Points (LP)).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft various Technical Machines (TMs). Once used in crafting, the material is consumed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; its value lies entirely in the "out-of-battle" preparation phase to teach Pokémon new moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the crafting economy that replaced the "Infinite Use" TM system in Paldea.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Igglybuff family. It is typically found in the early-to-mid-game areas of the Paldea region (e.g., South Province).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense, it is guaranteed to drop from:
    1.  **Igglybuff**
    2.  **Jigglypuff**
    3.  **Wigglytuff**
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, materials like Igglybuff Fluff are essential for competitive team building to access high-value moves (such as **TM079 Dazzling Gleam** or **TM127 Play Rough**) which often require materials from Fairy-type Pokémon.
