## Identity & Utility
**TR63 (Power Gem)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** TR63 is a single-use data disc used to teach the move **Power Gem** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike the permanent TMs (Technical Machines) found in the same generation, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use, functioning similarly to the TM system in generations prior to Gen V. 
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars/Watts. At a cost of 6,000, it is considered a **mid-to-high value** consumable, typically requiring dedicated currency farming in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Power Gem**.
    * **Move Profile:** Power Gem is a **Special Rock-type** move with a Base Power of 80 and 100% Accuracy. It deals direct damage with no secondary effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. When used with the move Fling, TR63 deals significant physical damage but provides no additional status effects.
    * **Competitive Use:** Power Gem is highly valued as one of the few reliable **Special Rock-type** attacks. It is essential coverage for special attackers (such as Nihilego or Starmie) to hit Bug, Fire, Flying, and Ice types effectively, especially since most Rock moves (like Stone Edge) are Physical and have lower accuracy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility. It is compatible with a wide range of Pokémon, particularly those with crystalline or mineral themes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR63 is primarily acquired through two methods:
    1. **Watt Traders:** Periodically sold by Watt Traders throughout the Wild Area for Watts.
    2. **Max Raid Battles:** Dropped as a reward for defeating Rock-type Pokémon in Max Raid dens.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it must be obtained via Galar's unique raid economy or currency exchange.
* **Lore Context:** The flavor text describes the move it teaches as a "ray of light that sparkles as if it were made of gemstones," highlighting its association with precious minerals and light-based energy.
