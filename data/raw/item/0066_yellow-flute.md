## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Flute** is a **Flute** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A yellow instrument crafted from blown glass. When played in battle, its melody snaps a single Pokémon out of the confused state. It is a **Consumable Medicine** (though historically functioned as a reusable tool in its debut region) that can technically be bought or sold, but is usually acquired through specialized crafting.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cheap/Symbolic**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during battle, it immediately **cures confusion**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor physical damage if thrown; does not transfer the confusion-curing effect to the target).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Only.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), items that require a manual turn to use from the bag are prohibited. Players instead opt for the **Persim Berry** or **Lum Berry**, which cure confusion automatically as held items without wasting a turn. It is highly valued in **Nuzlocke challenges** as a repeatable (in early gens) or cheap way to manage confusion RNG.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a cycle of glass flutes (Blue, Red, Yellow, White, Black) crafted from volcanic ash.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally, the Yellow Flute is not found in standard Poké Marts. In its debut region (Hoenn), it must be crafted at the **Glass Workshop on Route 113** in exchange for **500 steps** worth of volcanic ash (soot) collected from the surrounding fields.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon**, making it a specialty item that must be crafted or found in specific overworld locations. In later generations, it often appears as a rare item or is phased out in favor of standardized medicine like Full Heal.
