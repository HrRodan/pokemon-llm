## Identity & Utility
**Orthworm Tarnish** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A piece of tarnish shed by an Orthworm. It is a specialized crafting reagent primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. As a TM Material, it is a consumable resource that cannot be used directly in battle or held for a competitive effect.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard for common materials). Note that while it can be sold for this price, its primary value is as a currency for crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, it is a required ingredient for heavy-hitting Steel-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard TM materials typically cannot be used with Fling or have a negligible base power of 10).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a utility item for the "League Points" economy and move acquisition system within the Paldean overworld. It has no application in Smogon or VGC formats beyond obtaining the moves themselves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is part of the "Materials" ecosystem where it is frequently gathered by defeating or catching wild Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the Paldea region. It is dropped by the Earthworm Pokémon, **Orthworm**, upon its defeat or capture.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is guaranteed loot from wild **Orthworm** (found primarily in the **Asado Desert** and mining areas). It is most efficiently gathered by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature.
* **Crafting Context:** Using World Knowledge, this material is notably required to craft **TM121 (Heavy Slam)** and **TM170 (Steel Beam)**, reflecting Orthworm's signature Steel typing and high physical weight.
