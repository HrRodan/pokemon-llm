## Identity & Utility
**TR14 (Metronome)** is a **Technical Record (TR)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use data disc used to teach the move **Metronome** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, which have infinite uses, a TR is a **Consumable** item that breaks after a single application. It is primarily used to expand a Pokémon's move pool with unpredictable utility.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** at Wild Area Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Metronome**. When used in battle, Metronome causes the user to "waggle a finger," stimulating the brain to randomly execute almost any move in the game (excluding a specific list of restricted moves like *Sketch*, *Transform*, or other multi-turn/special moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling with this item deals minimal damage and provides no additional secondary effect, making it a poor choice for Fling-based strategies.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** While Metronome is a fan-favorite for "Metronome Battles" and casual playthroughs, its inherent randomness makes it unviable for serious competitive VGC or Smogon formats, where consistency is prioritized.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "mystical" or "clever" Pokémon, most notably the Clefairy and Togepi lines.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR14 is primarily obtained by defeating Raid Bosses in **Max Raid Battles** (specifically Fairy or Normal-type dens) or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (usually around 2,000–3,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be earned through raid participation or currency exchange, reflecting its nature as a high-tech data record of a classic, chaotic move.
