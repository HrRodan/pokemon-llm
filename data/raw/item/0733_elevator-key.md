## Identity & Utility
**Elevator Key** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized electronic card key required to operate the elevator systems within the Lysandre Labs. It is visually distinct for being emblazoned with the Team Flare logo. As a Key Item, it is categorized as a non-consumable utility that cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to various floors within the **Lysandre Labs** in *Pokémon X and Y*. Without this item, progression through the Team Flare headquarters is halted, as it is required to reach the deeper levels where the story climax occurs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and has no mechanical application in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution, nor does it interact with abilities like Pickup or Honey Gather. It resides in the "Key Items" pocket of the Bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the main storyline of *Pokémon X and Y*. It is specifically acquired within **Lysandre Labs** after the player defeats the Team Flare Scientist **Xerosic**. Upon his defeat, he grudgingly allows the player to take the key to proceed further into the facility.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be farmed. It is a unique, one-time acquisition per playthrough.
