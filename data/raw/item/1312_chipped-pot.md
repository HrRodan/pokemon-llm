## Identity & Utility
**Chipped Pot** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A peculiar, albeit slightly damaged, teapot used to trigger evolution in a specific species of Pokémon. Despite its imperfection, it is noted for pouring delicious tea. It is a **Single-Use Consumable** evolution item that can be purchased under specific conditions.
* **Cost:** 38,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its status as a rare specialty item rather than a common commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a **Sinistea (Antique Form)**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Polteageist (Antique Form)**. 
    * *Crucial Distinction:* Unlike the *Cracked Pot* (which evolves the common "Phony" form), the Chipped Pot only works on the extremely rare "Antique" Sinistea, which features a small mark of authenticity on the bottom of its cup.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High physical damage when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Pre-Battle.** The item holds no value in a competitive battle set (such as VGC or Smogon) as it provides no passive buffs. Its utility is strictly limited to the evolution process to obtain a "certified" authentic Polteageist for collection or competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the exclusive evolution trigger for Antique Form Sinistea. It is consumed upon successful evolution and cannot be reused.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Galar), it is primarily obtained through the **Bargain Shop** in **Stow-on-Side**. Because the inventory rotates daily, it is considered a rare find. It can also be found as a rare sparkling item in specific locations like the Giant's Foot (Crown Tundra).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon (0% encounter rate). Acquisition relies almost entirely on shop RNG or fixed overworld spawns. Its rarity mirrors the 1% encounter rate of the Antique Form Sinistea it is designed to evolve.
