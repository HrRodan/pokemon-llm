## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Dra6132** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once consumed, the designated Pokémon—in this case, a specific promotional encounter—will appear in the den until the end of the day or until defeated. It serves as a bridge between real-world promotions and in-game PvE content.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a technical price in the code, it is **not for sale** in any standard Poké Mart; it is a promotional item typically distributed via Serial Codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone tower in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area), it generates a red beam of light. This initiates a **Max Raid Battle** against a specific Pokémon associated with the "Dra6132" designation (historically associated with promotional Gigantamax encounters like **Duraludon** in specific regions).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a purely utility-based PvE item used for catching rare Pokémon or farming specific Max Raid rewards (Dynamax Candies, TRs, and Exp. Candies).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon the activation of the raid den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **special promotional events** (often through retailers like GameStop, 7-Eleven, or CoroCoro Magazine). Players would receive a serial code to redeem the item via Mystery Gift. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these crystals are unique digital keys meant to facilitate limited-time "Event Raids" outside of the standard Wild Area news cycle.
* **Context:** The "Dra" prefix in the internal name often identifies the specific encounter data—in the case of the "Dra" series, it was utilized for specific retail distributions allowing players to access Gigantamax-capable Pokémon earlier or more reliably than through standard den RNG.
