## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2650** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the designated Pokémon remains available for encounter until the end of the day. It functions as a single-use event trigger.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but functionally **Not for sale** through standard gameplay; this value is a placeholder for a promotional item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Wild Area's West Lake Axewell), it initiates a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon determined by the crystal's ID. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, these crystals are highly valued for providing early-game access to specific Pokémon (like Larvitar or Jangmo-o) or Pokémon with guaranteed High IVs and Hidden Abilities, which are essential for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon or interact with standard battle abilities. It is strictly a world-interaction item used to facilitate a raid encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed via **promotional codes**, such as those provided with the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack or through physical retail partnerships (e.g., Target, GameStop). They cannot be obtained via standard Poke Marts or found as random loot.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to bridge the gap between physical retail purchases and in-game rewards.
* **Context:** The "Gem" series of Dynamax Crystals was part of a broader "Wild Area News" and distribution mechanic designed to encourage players to visit the Watchtower Lair, a landmark that otherwise remains inactive during normal gameplay.
