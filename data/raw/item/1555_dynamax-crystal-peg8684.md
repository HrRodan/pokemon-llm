## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PEG8684)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears in a beam of light, remaining available until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game commerce.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the data lists a cost of 20, this is a technical placeholder; these items are exclusively obtained via external promotional codes and are not sold by NPCs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to spawn. The encounter is a Max Raid Battle, allowing the player and up to three others to battle and attempt to catch the Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate an encounter. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess 4-5 perfect IVs and the potential for Hidden Abilities, making them highly valuable for breeding competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly linked to the **Dynamax/Gigantamax** mechanic. It is consumed immediately upon the successful activation of the Watchtower Lair raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **special promotions** (such as retail serial codes from stores like GameStop or Pokémon Center pre-order bonuses). It is not available through natural gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. These are unique digital assets tied to the player's "Mystery Gift" or external distribution rather than the natural ecology of the Galar region. 
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique landmark in the Wild Area that remains inactive unless a Dynamax Crystal is introduced, serving as a gateway for specific rare species to manifest in a Dynamax state.
