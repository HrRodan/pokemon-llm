## Identity & Utility
**Steel Gem** is a **Jewel** (Consumable Held Item) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A gem containing the essence of steel. It is a held item that acts as a single-use "nuke" for a specific move type. Once the holder uses a damaging Steel-type attack, the item triggers automatically to boost the move's power and is then consumed.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though typically acquired through environmental exploration rather than traditional Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Steel-type move, the power of that move is increased by **1.5×** (in Generation V) or **1.3×** (in Generation VI and later), and the item is consumed immediately.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems generally cannot be used effectively with Fling; they are intended to be consumed by their own mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** In its debut generation (Gen V), the Steel Gem was a **high-impact competitive item**, allowing Pokémon to bypass defensive checks with a one-time massive damage spike. It is particularly effective for triggering the **Unburden** ability (Speed doubles when a held item is consumed).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Acrobatics Synergy:** Consuming the gem satisfies the "no held item" requirement for the move Acrobatics in the same turn.
    * **Type-Boosting:** It is part of the elemental gem cycle (e.g., Fire Gem, Water Gem).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its origin region (Unova), Steel Gems are primarily found within **Dust Clouds** in caves (such as Wellspring Cave or Chargestone Cave). In later generations, elemental gems became significantly harder to obtain, often restricted to special events or specific battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. They are typically gathered via environmental interactions or the **Pickup** ability in specific game versions.
* **Lore:** The item represents a concentrated crystalline form of metallic energy, shattering upon use to release its power into the user's attack.
