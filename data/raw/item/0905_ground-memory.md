## Identity & Utility
**Ground Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech memory disc containing Ground-type data. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for the Pokémon **Silvally**. While it has a defined price, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically treated as a collectible or signature equipment.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard cost, though typically acquired as a set of key items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, this item triggers its **RKS System** ability, changing the Pokémon's type to **Ground**. Additionally, it changes the type of Silvally’s signature move, **Multi-Attack**, to Ground.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; using Fling will cause Silvally to revert to its Normal-type form mid-battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** Ground-type Silvally is utilized when a team requires a Ground-type pivot with access to utility moves like Parting Shot or Defog. It provides a crucial immunity to Electric-type attacks. However, because it occupies the held item slot, Silvally cannot use other competitive items like Life Orb or Leftovers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no effect on other Pokémon species. It is functionally useless if held by any Pokémon other than Silvally, essentially acting as a dead weight with a 50 BP Fling.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), the Ground Memory is obtained as part of a complete set of 17 memories gifted to the player by **Gladion** at the Aether Paradise after becoming Champion. In Sword/Shield, it is provided by an NPC in the Battle Tower upon receiving a Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a synthetic, man-made object created specifically to interface with Type: Null's evolution, mirroring the "Drive" and "Plate" mechanics of Genesect and Arceus respectively.
