## Identity & Utility
**Big Pearl** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation II** (and featured prominently in the Generation IV Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A large, silver-colored pearl with a high-gloss finish. It is a non-functional **Consumable (Loot)** item that serves no direct purpose in battle or training; its sole design is to be sold for currency.
* **Cost:** 8,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it can be "bought" in specific late-game markets in certain versions, it is almost exclusively found or farmed to be sold back to shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** High-value liquidation. While standard Poké Marts typically offer 4,000 Poké Dollars (half the base cost), specialized NPCs—such as the **Ore Collector** in Gen IV—will buy it for a premium (up to 7,500 Poké Dollars).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no tactical utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon). Holding this item in a competitive match is a disadvantage as it provides no stat boosts or recovery.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a financial asset.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in coastal areas, underwater (via Diving), or as a reward for high-level **Pickup** users. In Gen IV, it is frequently found by searching near water or through the Dowsing Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a rare held item on shell-bearing or "swallowing" Pokémon. It can be farmed from:
    * **Shellder** and **Cloyster** (Standard sources).
    * **Clamperl** (Primary source in Hoenn/Sinnoh).
    * **Gulpin** and **Swalot** (Unconventional sources, likely representing items they have "swallowed").
* **Farming Context:** Skilled trainers use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to farm Big Pearls from wild Shellder or Clamperl to quickly accumulate wealth for expensive items like TMs or Vitamins.
