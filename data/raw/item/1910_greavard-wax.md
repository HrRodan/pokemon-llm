## Identity & Utility
**Greavard Wax** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed or gathered from the Greavard evolutionary line. As a "TM Material," it serves as a regional currency used specifically at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers in the Paldea region. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that can be sold, but not bought from standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a recipe component.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP), it allows the player to "print" TMs to teach moves to their Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld crafting system. However, it is indirectly vital for the competitive scene as it is required to manufacture competitive-standard TMs like **TM114 (Shadow Ball)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone and does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource dropped by the Ghost-type dog Pokémon, Greavard.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop from wild encounters. It is not available for purchase at Poke Marts or Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item, but rather a guaranteed or high-probability drop after defeating or catching wild **Greavard** or **Houndstone**.
* **Lore Context:** Greavard is known for the candle that grows atop its head; the "wax" is a byproduct of its spectral flame. In the Paldea ecosystem, trainers collect these remnants to power the technology that replicates ancient and modern move-teaching techniques.
