## Identity & Utility
**Skrelp Kelp** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation 9 (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized material dropped by members of the Skrelp evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** used at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. While it cannot be used directly in battle, it is a necessary resource for teaching specific moves to Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It can be sold to vendors for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a recipe ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points and other materials, it allows the player to "print" specific TMs to teach moves to their team. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Systemic.** While the item itself has no competitive utility, it is essential for the "Technical Machine Machine" system, which players use to acquire competitive-grade moves like *Sludge Bomb* or *Venoshock* in the Paldea region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily interacted with through the **TM Machine** interface. Unlike berries or held items, it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Skrelp** or **Dragalge**. It is most commonly found in the coastal waters and seas of the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but rather a guaranteed or high-probability drop upon the conclusion of an encounter. In *Pokémon Scarlet*, Skrelp is a version-exclusive, making this material a trade-dependent resource for players of *Pokémon Violet* unless acquired through Tera Raid Battles or Union Circle play.
