## Identity & Utility
**Sea Incense** is a **Type-enhancement** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A curious incense that exudes a distinct aroma, designed to be held by a Pokémon. It functions as both an offensive booster for Water-type techniques and a vital catalyst for specific breeding results. It is a **Holdable Consumable** (in a breeding context) and a **Persistent Held Item** (in battle) that can typically be purchased for **2,000 Poké Dollars** (Relatively Cheap/Accessible).
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Cheap).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the power of the holder's **Water-type moves by 20%**. This effect is identical to the *Mystic Water* and the *Wave Incense*.
* **Breeding Mechanic:** This is a **Baby Trigger** item. When a female Marill or Azumarill (or either paired with Ditto) holds the Sea Incense while at the Pokémon Nursery or Day Care, the resulting Egg will hatch into an **Azurill**. If the item is not held, the Egg will hatch directly into a Marill.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low; provides minimal damage and no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Functional. In standard competitive play (Smogon/VGC), it is functionally redundant with *Mystic Water*. It is occasionally used in "Item Clause" formats where a player wants to boost the Water-type moves of two different Pokémon without using a *Life Orb* or *Choice* item, though it is generally outclassed by more versatile offensive items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates the acquisition of Azurill to complete the Pokédex. It does not provide any bonuses to the ability *Pickup* or interact uniquely with abilities like *Klutz* beyond being neutralized.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in locations associated with water or spirits, such as **Mt. Pyre** in the Hoenn region. In various games, it can be purchased at specialty markets (e.g., Slateport City, Driftveil City, or Hulbury).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon**. It must be found as a field item or purchased from specialized incense merchants.
* **Lore Context:** The Sea Incense is part of a suite of incense items (alongside Lax, Odd, Full, etc.) that allow trainers to discover "Baby" forms of Pokémon that were discovered in later generations, bridging the biological gap through "curious aromas."
