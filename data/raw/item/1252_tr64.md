## Identity & Utility
**TR64** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** TR64 is a single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon the move **Focus Blast**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic consumable mechanic for high-powered moves. It allows the user to heighten mental focus and unleash power, potentially lowering the target's Special Defense.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). When sold or purchased via Watt Traders in the Wild Area, it represents a high-tier investment for competitive movesets.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Focus Blast** (Special / Fighting-type / 120 Power / 70% Accuracy). This move is one of the most powerful Special Fighting moves available but is notorious for its low accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120. This is among the highest possible Fling damage values in the game, making it a devastating one-time projectile if the user has the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Focus Blast is essential coverage for many Special Attackers (such as Gengar, Alakazam, or Reuniclus) to hit Steel, Dark, and Rock-type threats that would otherwise wall them. In competitive circles, it is often jokingly referred to as "Focus Miss" due to its unreliable 70% accuracy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Not used for evolution. As a TR, it is single-use; however, players often farm multiple copies to optimize different team members.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts (W), or received as a reward for defeating Fighting-type or high-star **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In the Galar region, these records are localized technology found primarily within the **Wild Area** ecosystem and are often gathered by players farming Dynamax Dens.
