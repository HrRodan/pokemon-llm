## Identity & Utility
**Relaxed Mint** is a **Nature Mint** (Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herb that, when used on a Pokémon, aligns its stat growth patterns with the **Relaxed Nature**. It is a consumable medicine that is rarely available for standard currency; it is primarily a post-game optimization tool.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inexpensive/Special Acquisition**). While the internal value is low, its true cost is typically **50 Battle Points (BP)** at Battle Tower shops or **20,000 Poké Dollars** in later regions like Paldea.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently modifies a Pokémon’s stat multipliers. It increases the growth rate of **Defense** by 10% and decreases the growth rate of **Speed** by 10%. 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon's actual Nature name (e.g., "Bashful") remains unchanged on the status screen, and its breeding inheritance remains tied to the original Nature; only the combat stats are recalculated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Competitive Staple).** This item is essential for "fixing" the stats of Legendary Pokémon, Shiny Pokémon, or gift Pokémon with suboptimal natures. The Relaxed growth pattern is specifically favored for **Defensive Tanks** and **Trick Room** attackers who benefit from high physical bulk and low Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It bypasses the need for intensive breeding, allowing any Pokémon to become "Battle Ready."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in post-game locations. In Galar, it is purchased from the **Battle Tower**; in Paldea, it is available at **Chansey Supply** outlets after earning enough Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial or highly cultivated resource intended for high-level trainers. Often gathered as a rare reward from **Max Raid Battles** or **Tera Raid Battles**.
