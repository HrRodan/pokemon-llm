## Identity & Utility
**Pikashunium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized, crystallized form of Z-Power designed specifically for event-exclusive "Cap Pikachu" variants. It is a **Held Item** that serves as a signature mechanic for the Pikachu line, specifically those wearing hats from the Pokémon anime. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). As a Z-Crystal, it is a unique item that cannot be sold, traded, or consumed.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Pikachu wearing a cap** (e.g., Original Cap, Hoenn Cap, Partner Cap, etc.) that knows the move **Thunderbolt**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item provides Pikachu with an extremely high-powered nuke (Base Power 195) that has an **increased critical-hit ratio (+2 stages)**. While powerful, it is restricted to Cap Pikachu variants, which generally have lower base stats than evolved forms, making it a high-risk, high-reward niche choice in specific formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Specific Requirement:** This crystal does *not* work on standard Pikachu or Alolan Raichu (who has its own Aloraichium Z).
    * **Mechanic Immunity:** Like all Z-Crystals, this item cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, and is unaffected by the ability *Sticky Hold* or *Klutz*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained via special distribution events or specific NPCs. In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is specifically given to the player by a Pikachu at **Pikachu Valley** if they have a Cap Pikachu in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a rare "Gift" item tied to the bond between a trainer and a special event Pokémon.
* **Flavor Context:** The item represents the culmination of Ash Ketchum's Pikachu's power, as the resulting Z-Move is a direct reference to the anime's "Ultimate" move.
