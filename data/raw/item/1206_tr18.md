## Identity & Utility
**TR18 (Leech Life)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use teaching device that imparts the move **Leech Life** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, reflecting the mechanic used for high-powered or highly desirable moves. 
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**). While it has a high monetary sell value, it is primarily traded for **Watts** at Watt Traders in the Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Leech Life**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Bug-type Physical move with **80 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. 
    * **Health Drain:** The user recovers 50% of the damage dealt to the target. This provides excellent offensive presence combined with sustain.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output when used with the move Fling, though the teaching utility is lost).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Since its massive power buff in Generation VII (from 20 to 80 power), Leech Life has become the premier Bug-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for physical attackers. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like **Buzzwole, Scizor, Golisopod, and Araquanid** in both Smogon and VGC formats to provide longevity in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a vital resource for physical attackers that lack reliable recovery methods.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR18 is primarily obtained by defeating Bug-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured pedagogical device found in the Galar region. Its rarity compared to early-game TMs makes it a mid-to-late-game optimization tool.
