## Identity & Utility
**Kangaskhanite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized evolutionary stone. When held by a Kangaskhan, it enables the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle, assuming the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a rare, unique item typically obtained through specific overworld discovery or high-level battle rewards.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the transformation of **Kangaskhan into Mega Kangaskhan** mid-battle. This transformation grants a significant stat boost and replaces Kangaskhan's standard ability with **Parental Bond**, which allows the Pokémon to attack twice per turn (the second hit dealing reduced damage).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In standard play, Mega Stones cannot be removed, stolen, or flung if held by the correct Pokémon during the Mega Evolution process).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Legendary/High-Tier Staple.** In Generation VI, Kangaskhanite was one of the most dominant items in the history of competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon), eventually leading to Mega Kangaskhan being banned to the "Ubers" tier in many formats due to the sheer power of the Parental Bond ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically interacts only with **Kangaskhan**. It does not trigger a permanent evolution; the form reverts to standard Kangaskhan once the battle concludes or if the Pokémon faints.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in post-game locations. In its debut (X/Y), it is located in the **Glittering Cave** after upgrading the Mega Ring. In later titles like Sun/Moon, it is often purchased using **Battle Points (BP)** at facilities like the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This item is treated as a unique relic, and unlike berries or common tools, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild Kangaskhan.
