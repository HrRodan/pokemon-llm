## Identity & Utility
**Gardevoirite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by a Gardevoir, it enables the Pokémon to transform into Mega Gardevoir during battle. It is a **Specialized Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Gardevoir, the trainer can trigger a Mega Evolution. This grants Gardevoir a massive increase in Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed, and replaces its ability with **Pixilate** (which converts Normal-type moves into Fairy-type moves and boosts their power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Base power only; Mega Stones generally cannot be removed from the holder in battle by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if the holder is the correct species).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple** (Gen VI–VII). Mega Gardevoir is a premier "Wallbreaker" in competitive formats like Smogon OU and VGC. The combination of the Gardevoirite and the move *Hyper Voice* (boosted by Pixilate) allows it to deal massive spread damage that bypasses *Substitute*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically tied to Gardevoir. It does **not** affect Gallade, which requires a separate Mega Stone (Galladite). The item is useless if held by any Pokémon other than Gardevoir.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually restricted to post-game content or special NPC interactions. In its debut (Pokémon X/Y), it is gifted by Diantha in Lumiose City. In Generation VII, it is typically obtained as a reward for Battle Tree participation (purchased for BP).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item that cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters. Its presence in a region is often lore-linked to the presence of Mega Evolution energy (Infinity Energy).
