## Identity & Utility
**Light Clay** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized holdable item designed for support Pokémon to extend the longevity of defensive barriers. It is a "holdable-active" item, meaning its effect triggers automatically when the holder executes specific moves. 
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive; typically found in specialized shops or through exploration rather than basic Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses the moves **Reflect**, **Light Screen**, or **Aurora Veil**, the duration of the resulting barrier is extended from the standard five turns to **eight turns**. 
* **Technical Nuance:** The extension is applied to the move's effect at the moment of casting. Consequently, the barrier remains active for the full eight turns even if the holder switches out, faints, or has their item removed (via Knock Off or Thief) after the moves have been used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple**. It is the foundational item for "Dual Screens" or "Hyper Offense" team archetypes. By providing three extra turns of halved damage, it grants setup sweepers (like Dragonite or Volcarona) a much safer window to boost their stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It is categorized as an "underground" item, historically obtainable through mining mechanics in the Sinnoh region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in the Sinnoh Underground or sold by late-game BP (Battle Point) vendors in various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Light Clay can be farmed from wild Pokémon that are thematic to earth and clay. It is occasionally held by wild **Baltoy**, **Claydol**, **Golett**, **Golurk**, **Mudbray**, and **Mudsdale**. Players often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the encounter rate and **Frisk** or **Thief** to acquire it.
