## Identity & Utility
**Cherry Tomatoes** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation 9 (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fresh, vibrant food item used specifically during Picnics for the sandwich-making minigame. It is a consumable ingredient that provides specific flavor profiles and Meal Powers to the player. It is a common item that can be bought in bulk.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a filling in a sandwich, Cherry Tomatoes add specific values to the sandwich's internal stats. They typically contribute to **Bug-type** Meal Powers and provide a balance of **Sweet and Sour** flavors. These sandwiches grant the player temporary bonuses such as increased Shiny rates (Sparkling Power), encounter rates (Encounter Power), or breeding speed (Egg Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. Its utility is strictly restricted to the overworld Picnic mechanic. It is, however, a staple for "Shiny Hunters" and "Breeders" due to its role in specific sandwich recipes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon the completion of a sandwich.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at food-specific retail outlets in the Paldea region, such as **Sure Cans**, **Deli Cioso**, and **Aguirre's Deli**. It is unlocked for purchase early in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or traditional held items, this is a culinary commodity found exclusively in grocery markets or occasionally rewarded by NPCs after Tera Raid Battles.
