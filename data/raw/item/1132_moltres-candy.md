## Identity & Utility
**Moltres Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with concentrated energy. Unlike generic candies, it is designed for a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is used primarily to bypass traditional training methods to maximize a Pokémon's potential.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its value lies in its rarity/acquisition method rather than its purchase price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Moltres**, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 point. This contributes to the **Awakening Values (AVs)** system unique to the Kanto remakes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it functions within the AV system of the *Let's Go* series, which replaces the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. It is essential for "Master Trainers" challenges and high-level post-game play within its debut titles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancer. It cannot be used on any Pokémon other than Moltres.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!* by catching multiple Moltres (via Go Park transfers) or by transferring Moltres to Professor Oak. It can also be awarded by walking with a Moltres in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is tied to **Catch Combos** or **Professor Rewards**, reflecting the player's proficiency in research and conservation.
* **Context:** In the lore of the *Let's Go* games, species-specific candies represent a more refined and potent version of generic stat-boosting food, tailored to the unique biology of the Legendary Bird of Fire.
