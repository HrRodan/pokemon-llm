## Identity & Utility
**Misdreavus Tears** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A crafting reagent dropped by members of the Misdreavus evolutionary line. It represents a biological material used in the Paldean Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) system. It is a **Consumable Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held for a competitive benefit.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily converted into League Points (LP) or used as a crafting currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the TM Machine, players must combine these tears with League Points (LP) to create moves that Misdreavus or Mismagius are known to use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item is a material and cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld crafting economy. It provides no statistical or tactical advantage during a Pokémon battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Unlike the Dusk Stone required to evolve Misdreavus into Mismagius, these tears are a byproduct of the species rather than a catalyst for growth.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the **Paldea region** (and potentially Kitakami/Blueberry Academy) by defeating or catching wild members of the Misdreavus line.
* **Wild Drops:** Guaranteed or highly probable drop from wild **Misdreavus** and **Mismagius**. Because these Pokémon are nocturnal, farming Misdreavus Tears is most efficient during the **Night** cycle in ruins, forests, or mountainous biomes. It is frequently gathered in bulk to craft high-value Ghost-type moves like **Shadow Ball** or utility moves like **Confuse Ray**.
