## Identity & Utility
**Abomasite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A specialized, non-consumable held item. When held by an Abomasnow, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. As a Mega Stone, it is a unique artifact that cannot be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the Mega Evolution of **Abomasnow** into **Mega Abomasnow** upon the trainer's command in battle. This transformation significantly boosts Abomasnow's offensive and defensive base stats and retains/re-activates the **Snow Warning** ability, which summons a hailstorm (or snow in Gen IX).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High). However, using Fling is highly discouraged as it consumes the stone and prevents Mega Evolution for the remainder of the encounter.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategy-Specific.** Mega Abomasnow is primarily utilized in **Trick Room** archetypes due to its base 30 Speed. It serves as a powerful "Mixed Wallbreaker" but is hampered by a 4x weakness to Fire and a high number of common weaknesses (Fighting, Rock, Steel, Bug, Poison, Flying).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is not a permanent evolution stone; it is a temporary combat transformation. In battle, the Abomasite is "sticky"—it cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, and cannot be traded via *Trick* or *Switcheroo* if held by Abomasnow.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired as a one-time gift or found in a specific late-game or post-game location. 
    * In *Pokémon X & Y*, it is gifted by an Abomasnow in the Frost Cavern. 
    * In *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*, it is found on the ground at the Berry Master's Garden.
    * In *Sun & Moon*, it is obtainable via the Battle Tree or special distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique item that cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
