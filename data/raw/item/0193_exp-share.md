## Identity & Utility
**Exp. Share** is a **Training** item introduced in **Generation III** (with roots as the "Exp. All" in Gen I).
* **Description:** A specialized device designed to facilitate team-wide growth. Depending on the generation, it functions as either a held item or a Key Item. It is a **Consumable/Key/Held** hybrid that **cannot** be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This signifies its status as a unique quest reward or essential progression tool.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its held-item form (Gen II–V), it splits experience points: 50% of the total experience is shared among Pokémon that participated in battle, while the remaining 50% is distributed among Pokémon holding this item. If a Pokémon participates in battle *and* holds the Exp. Share, it effectively gains experience from both pools. In its modern form (Gen VI onwards), it acts as a toggleable Key Item that grants 100% experience to the active battler and 50% experience to all non-participating party members.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with Fling as it is typically a Key Item in modern iterations or too valuable to discard).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Combat.** It has zero utility in competitive PvP (VGC/Smogon) as it provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages during a match. Its value lies entirely in **metagame preparation**, significantly reducing the time required to level up Pokémon to level 50 or 100 for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for evolving "baby" Pokémon or weak base-stage Pokémon (e.g., Magikarp or Larvesta) by allowing them to gain levels and Effort Values (EVs) without being exposed to direct combat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired as a high-value gift from prominent NPCs. Notable locations include rewards from the **Devon Corporation** (Hoenn), **Mr. Pokémon** (Johto), or as a reward for registered caught Pokémon counts from **Professor Assistants**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made technological tool, making it a rare "one-per-game" item in older generations, though it became a permanent party-wide feature in later regions.
* **Nuzlocke Context:** Often viewed as a "Quality of Life" tool. In "Hardcore Nuzlocke" rules, players often use the Exp. Share to reach level caps quickly, though some purists disable it in Gen VI+ to maintain a steeper difficulty curve.
