## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cvn4846)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-based item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **single-use consumable** that serves as a beacon for rare Dynamax encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Cheap**; however, this item is traditionally restricted to promotional distribution rather than standard Mart inventory).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the ruins of the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a Max Raid Battle to appear. This specific crystal (ID: cvn4846) is coded to summon a predetermined Pokémon (historically used for event-exclusive distributions like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax Corviknight).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching Pokémon or farming Raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, and Berries).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the Watchtower Lair raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Only.** These crystals were primarily distributed via **Serial Codes** provided by retailers (such as GameStop, EB Games, or Target) or through CoroCoro magazine promotions. They are not available through natural gameplay or the Watt Traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild specimens; they are strictly categorized as "Special Acquisition" items.
* **Context:** The "cvn" prefix in the internal name often identifies the specific promotional partner or region for which the crystal was generated, making each version of the Dynamax Crystal a unique collectible for that specific event window.
