## Identity & Utility
**Zap Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A legendary stone tablet inscribed with ancient power. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **holdable-active**, meaning its effects are persistent during battle. While it has a technical cost, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically found through exploration or the Underground.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, but generally unique).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Zap Plate increases the power of the holder’s **Electric-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Arceus Interaction:** This item is central to the mechanics of the Mythical Pokémon **Arceus**. When held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability, the holder’s primary type changes to **Electric**, and the move **Judgment** becomes Electric-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). When used with the move Fling, it deals significant physical damage but consumes the item for the remainder of the battle.
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a mandatory item for **Arceus-Electric** builds in Ubers/Restricted formats. For non-Arceus Pokémon, it functions identically to the **Magnet**; while useful in playthroughs to boost STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, competitive players often prefer **Life Orb** or **Choice items** for higher damage ceilings or **Heavy-Duty Boots** for utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with the ability **Pickup** (in specific games) and is affected by moves like **Knock Off** or **Trick** (unless held by Arceus, which cannot have its Plate removed in most generations).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found in the **Sinnoh Underground** via mining. In later titles, it is often found in fixed overworld locations (e.g., behind the lighthouse in Sun/Moon) or obtained from specific NPCs after showing them Arceus.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. 
* **Lore:** According to Sinnoh mythology, the Zap Plate is one of the fragments of the "Original One" (Arceus). The engravings on the plates tell the story of the universe's creation, with the Zap Plate representing the element of lightning and electricity.
