## Identity & Utility
**Grepa Berry** is an **Effort-Drop Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable fruit used primarily for training and temperament management. When fed to a Pokémon, it increases their Friendship (Happiness) while simultaneously lowering their Special Defense base points (Effort Values). It is a **Consumable** item that is technically buyable in specific contexts but is most commonly grown and harvested.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though more frequently obtained via cultivation than retail).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon's Happiness by a tiered amount (10, 5, or 2 points depending on current happiness levels) and **reduces Special Defense Effort Values (EVs) by 10**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Natural Gift:** When held and used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Flying-type** move with **90 Power** (Gen IV-VI).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **meta-game staple** for competitive players. It is used to "reset" or "fine-tune" a Pokémon's EV spread. If a player accidentally gains Special Defense EVs or wishes to reallocate those points into a different stat (like Speed or Attack) for a specific build, the Grepa Berry is the primary tool for correction.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger a specific evolution directly, it is frequently used to rapidly increase Friendship to trigger **Friendship-based evolutions** (e.g., Eevee to Sylveon/Espeon/Umbreon or Riolu to Lucario) without the need for leveling up or walking.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry trees across various regions or obtained from the Berry Master. In modern titles like *Sword & Shield* or *Scarlet & Violet*, they are found under trees in the Wild Area or at specialized auctions/Berry stands.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is almost entirely dependent on **Berry Agriculture** (planting and watering) or the **Pickup** ability in certain game versions.
* **Context:** It belongs to a cycle of six berries (Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, Tamato) that each lower a specific stat's EVs. The Grepa Berry is the designated "Special Defense" reducer of this group.
