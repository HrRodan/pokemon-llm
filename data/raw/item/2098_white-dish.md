## Identity & Utility
**White Dish** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The White Dish is a cosmetic and functional customization item used during the Picnic mechanic in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It serves as the aesthetic foundation for the sandwich-making minigame. It is a **Consumable/Utility** item specifically tied to the overworld camp system and **cannot** be used in standard battle sequences.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically obtained through specific NPC interactions, story progression, or as a default customization option).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a Picnic, they can choose the White Dish to change the visual appearance of the plate used during sandwich construction. While the dish itself does not alter the "Meal Powers" (such as Sparkling Power or Egg Power) provided by the sandwich ingredients, it is a required component for the picnic setup.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battling formats as it exists solely within the Picnic sub-menu.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Picnic** mechanic and the **Sandwich-making** interface.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the **Paldea region**. It is typically acquired from NPCs who specialize in picnic equipment or via **Picnic Knacks** shops in major cities like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a human-made utility item for trainers.
* **World Context:** In the context of Paldean culture, the White Dish represents a minimalist aesthetic for trainers who prefer a clean, professional look for their outdoor culinary activities. While other dishes may feature flashy patterns (like the Polka-Dot or Eevee dishes), the White Dish is the standard choice for focused sandwich crafting.
