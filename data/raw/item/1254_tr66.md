## Identity & Utility
**TR66 (Technical Record 66)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use teaching device that instructs a compatible Pokémon on how to use the move **Brave Bird**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, Technical Records are consumed upon use. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that is highly valued for its offensive utility.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). In the Galar region, these are primarily traded for **Watts** (W) rather than standard currency at Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Brave Bird** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile (Brave Bird):** A powerful Physical Flying-type move with 120 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. The user receives recoil damage equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120 (Extremely High). This is one of the highest possible Fling damage values, making it a potent one-time projectile in niche competitive sets.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Brave Bird is the gold standard for Physical Flying-type attackers (e.g., Corviknight, Talonflame, and Hawlucha). Its high base power makes it essential for Wall-breaking and Max Airstream boosting in Dynamax formats, despite the recoil penalty.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed once used, requiring the player to farm additional copies for multiple Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword & Shield**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts (the price fluctuates based on the trader's daily inventory) or earned as a reward for defeating Flying-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered through the **Max Raid** economy or by participating in the **Cram-o-matic** recipes in the Isle of Armor expansion.
