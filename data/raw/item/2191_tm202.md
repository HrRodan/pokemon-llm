## Identity & Utility
**TM202 (Pain Split)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to provide a Pokémon with the move **Pain Split**. In the current generation, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Pain Split**. This Normal-type Status move adds the user's current HP and the target's current HP together, then distributes the total equally between the two. It bypasses Substitutes and is a unique form of "healing" that simultaneously damages the opponent.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly valuable for defensive Pokémon with naturally low base HP stats (such as **Mimikyu**, **Rotom**, or **Spiritomb**). It allows these Pokémon to survive longer by "draining" the health of high-HP tanks like Chansey or Dondozo. It is a staple in various Smogon singles tiers and a niche pick in VGC for specific trick room or stall builds.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be remade indefinitely if the player has the necessary materials.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item on the ground within the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy). Once found, the recipe is unlocked at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM202, the player requires:
    * **4,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Solosis Cells**
    * **3x Mimikyu Scraps**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; the materials required to craft it are dropped by the **Solosis** and **Mimikyu** evolutionary lines.
