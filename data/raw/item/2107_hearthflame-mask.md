## Identity & Utility
**Hearthflame Mask** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically the *The Teal Mask* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A mysterious, ornate mask glowing with a fiery aura. It is a specialized form-change item specifically designed for the legendary Pokémon **Ogerpon**. As a unique artifact of the Kitakami region, it cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Ogerpon**, it triggers a form change into **Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon**. This shifts Ogerpon's secondary typing to **Fire**, resulting in a Grass/Fire dual type. Additionally, all of Ogerpon’s moves receive a **1.2x power multiplier**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. This item cannot be removed, stolen, or Flung from Ogerpon during battle via moves like Knock Off, Thief, or Trick.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Hearthflame Ogerpon is considered one of the strongest physical attackers in the Generation IX competitive meta (VGC and Smogon). Its signature move, **Ivy Cudgel**, becomes Fire-type, and upon Terastallizing, its ability becomes **Embody Aspect**, granting an immediate +1 stage boost to its Attack stat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It specifically interacts with Ogerpon’s **Tera Shift** mechanic; when Terastallized while holding this mask, Ogerpon gains a unique Fire-type Tera Form with boosted stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a core story progression item in the *The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero* DLC. It is recovered by the player after the truth about the "Loyal Three" is revealed in Kitakami.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique legendary item that remains in the player’s "Other Items" or "Held Items" pocket and is tied to the lore of the "Ogre" of Kitakami.
