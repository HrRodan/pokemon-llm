## Identity & Utility
**Sweet Heart** is a **Healing** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A piece of cloyingly sweet chocolate used to treat injured Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used both during and outside of battle. Despite its healing properties, it functions more as a novelty or gift item than a practical medical staple.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Given that it provides the same healing as a standard Potion (which costs 200), its price-to-recovery ratio is extremely poor, marking it as a premium or specialty item rather than an efficient resource.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a Pokémon, it **restores 20 HP**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; provides no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is entirely outclassed by nearly every other healing item (such as Sitrus Berries for held-item healing or Hyper Potions/Full Restores for bag-use healing). It is primarily used for flavor or during the main story playthrough if found for free.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions and has no specific interactions with abilities like Pickup or Klutz beyond standard item restrictions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Sweet Hearts are rarely sold in standard Poké Marts. They are typically obtained through special NPC interactions (notably from the girl on Village Bridge in Unova after showing her certain Pokémon) or as gifts during seasonal events. In some games, they can be purchased at specialty shops or received via the Wonder Trade / Surprise Trade mechanics as "thank you" gifts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is generally acquired through **Event Distributions** or specific **NPC scripted events** rather than farming.
