## Identity & Utility
**HM02 (Fly)** is a **Hidden Machine (HM)** introduced in **Generation I** (though this specific data entry is indexed from the Generation III Hoenn archive).
* **Description:** A specialized machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Fly**. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in earlier generations, HMs are high-priority Key Items that allow for infinite uses and are essential for world navigation.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest-related item that cannot be bought or sold in shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Fly** to a compatible Pokémon (primarily Flying-types, though some others like Mew or Golurk can learn it). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Move Profile:** Fly is a two-turn physical Flying-type move. On the first turn, the user "soars" into a semi-invulnerable state (avoiding most attacks except Gust, Thunder, Twister, or Hurricane); on the second turn, it deals significant damage.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (HMs cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche/Low Tier** in standard competitive play (Smogon) because the two-turn window allows the opponent to safely switch to a defensive counter. However, it sees occasional use in **VGC (Doubles)** to stall out turns of Tailwind or Trick Room, and is a **high-priority utility** in Nuzlocke runs for safe pivoting and map traversal.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Field Move:** HM02 is legendary for its out-of-battle utility, allowing the player to instantly teleport to any previously visited Pokémon Center or major landmark.
    * **Progression Lock:** In most classic titles, the player must defeat a specific Gym Leader (e.g., Winona in Hoenn, Erika in Kanto) to unlock the ability to use this item outside of battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** HM02 is never found in marts. It is traditionally gifted to the player by an NPC after a major story beat. 
    * *Kanto:* Found in a hidden house on Route 16.
    * *Hoenn:* Gifted by the Rival (May/Brendan) after the battle on Route 119.
    * *Sinnoh:* Found in the Galactic Warehouse in Veilstone City.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. As a permanent machine, it is unique and cannot be farmed.
* **Historical Context:** While modern generations (Gen VII onwards) have replaced HMs with "Ride Pokémon" or "Secret Techniques" to remove the need for "HM Slaves," HM02 remains one of the most iconic items in the franchise's history for its role in world traversal.
