## Identity & Utility
**Violet Book** is a **Key Item** (classified as an event-item in data) introduced in **Generation IX** (*Pokémon Violet*).
* **Description:** A record of the Area Zero expedition led by the researcher Heath two-hundred years ago. It contains sketches and descriptions of the mysterious "Paradox Pokémon" found within the Great Crater of Paldea. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Unique Key Item/Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a central narrative device for the "Path of Legends" and "The Way Home" storylines. While it has no direct mechanical effect on Pokémon stats or levels, it provides the player with lore regarding the Paradox Pokémon (such as Iron Valiant and Iron Treads) and hints at the "Disk Pokémon" (Terapagos).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-critical item and cannot be used in Smogon or VGC competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Plot Trigger:** In the *Indigo Disk* DLC, the Violet Book is essential for triggering the special encounter at the **Crystal Pool** in the Kitakami region, allowing the player to encounter the Professor from the past/alternate timeline.
    * **Counterpart:** It serves as the *Pokémon Violet* counterpart to the **Scarlet Book**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the main storyline of *Pokémon Violet*. It is initially in the possession of **Arven**, who eventually entrusts it to the player to assist in the exploration of Area Zero.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item linked to the player's Save Data.
* **Lore context:** The book is famous in the Paldea region for being dismissed as a work of science fiction for many years due to its "impossible" descriptions of futuristic metallic Pokémon. It is bound in a distinct violet cover, contrasting with the ancient aesthetic of its counterpart.
