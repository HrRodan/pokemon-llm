## Identity & Utility
**Fashion Case** is a **Key Item** (Gameplay category) introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A fancy, decorative case designed for the tidy arrangement and storage of whimsical Pokémon Accessories and backdrops. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold** and resides in the Key Items pocket of the Bag.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition/Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a specialized storage container for Accessories used in **Pokémon Super Contests**. It allows the player to collect, view, and manage various hats, flowers, ribbons, and backdrops used to dress up Pokémon for the "Visual Competition" phase of contests.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Non-Battle Utility)**. This item has no mechanical impact on competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) and is strictly used for the Contest sub-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally tethered to the **Sinnoh region's Super Contest** mechanics and the **Pokémon Dress-Up** feature in the Jubilife TV Station.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift from an NPC to facilitate participation in the world's side-activities. In *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, it is given to the player in **Jubilife City** (often by an NPC in the TV Station or by Bebe) to encourage creative expression. 
* **Wild Held Item:** **None**. As a unique Key Item, it is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a one-of-a-kind tool for the player's journey.
