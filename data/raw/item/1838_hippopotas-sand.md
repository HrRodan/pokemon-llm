## Identity & Utility
**Hippopotas Sand** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting resource dropped by members of the Hippopotas evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be exchanged for League Points (LP) or used at a Technical Machine Machine. While it has a nominal sell price, its primary value lies in moveset customization.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at a TM Machine. The player must combine this material with League Points (LP) and other Pokémon drops to create reusable or single-use move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no tactical application in VGC or Smogon formats; it functions exclusively as a progression and team-building utility for teaching moves to Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency/reagent for the Paldean crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Hippopotas** or **Hippowdon**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. It is a "Material" drop added directly to the player's Treasures/Materials pocket upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is most frequently farmed in desert biomes, such as the **Asado Desert** in the Paldea region.
* **Lore Context:** This sand is shed or collected from the bodies of the Hippo Pokémon, which are known for living in arid environments and expelling sand from the ports on their bodies to create sandstorms.
