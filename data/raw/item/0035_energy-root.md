## Identity & Utility
**Energy Root** is a **Consumable Medicine (Herbal Medicine)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An extremely bitter root used as a potent natural remedy. It is a consumable item that can be used both in and out of battle to provide high-tier healing. While highly effective at restoring health, its intense bitterness makes Pokémon less friendly toward their Trainer.
* **Cost:** 1,200 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; often serves as a more affordable, albeit penalizing, alternative to the Hyper Potion).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores a significant amount of HP to a single Pokémon. Historically, it restored **200 HP**, though this was adjusted to **120 HP** in Generation VII to align with the nerf to Hyper Potions.
* **Friendship Penalty:** Using this item decreases the Pokémon's Happiness/Friendship by 10 or 15 points (depending on current friendship tier). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Not used in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as Bag items are prohibited. However, it is a **Nuzlocke and Playthrough Staple** for mid-to-late game healing due to its high HP recovery for a lower price point than standard medicines.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interferes with Pokémon that evolve via high Friendship (e.g., **Golbat**, **Chansey**, **Riolu**). Conversely, it can be used strategically to maximize the power of the move **Frustration** (though this move was removed in Gen VIII).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually unavailable in standard Poké Marts. It must be purchased at specialized **Herbal Shops**, such as the one in Lavaridge Town (Hoenn), the Goldenrod City Underground (Johto), or the Eterna City Herb Shop (Sinnoh).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through specialty commerce, reflecting its status as a "traditional" or "folk" medicine compared to Silph Co. manufactured products.
