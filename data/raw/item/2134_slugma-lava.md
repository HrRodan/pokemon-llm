## Identity & Utility
**Slugma Lava** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specific material dropped by members of the Slugma evolutionary line after battle. It represents a condensed form of the molten magma that composes the Pokémon's body. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of League Points (LP) or used at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Very Cheap/Value Resource**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a fundamental component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is combined with League Points and other materials to create specific moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials generally cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the out-of-battle crafting economy and provides no tactical advantage in competitive Smogon or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Technical Machine crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Slugma** or **Magcargo**. It can also be found as a sparkling pickup on the ground in volcanic or rocky biomes where these Pokémon reside (such as the areas around Paldea's mountains or the Kitakami region).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is sourced exclusively from the **Slugma** family. In the context of Gen IX mechanics, it is often farmed by players using the "Let's Go" auto-battle feature to quickly accumulate materials for high-value TMs like *Flamethrower* or *Overheat*.
