## Identity & Utility
**TR99** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. This particular TR teaches **Body Press**, a Fighting-type physical attack where the user slams its body into the target. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are **Consumable** and break after a single use.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive / Often traded for Watts in-game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Body Press**. This move is unique because it calculates damage using the user's **Defense stat** instead of its Attack stat. It is a Physical move with a Base Power of 80 and 100% Accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Body Press revolutionized the competitive meta for defensive "walls." It allows Pokémon with massive Defense but low Attack (such as Corviknight, Ferrothorn, Bastiodon, and Zamazenta) to deal significant damage. It is particularly effective after using Defense-boosting moves like Iron Defense.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use and cannot be reused unless another copy is acquired.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR99 is primarily obtained by defeating Fighting-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 3,000–5,000 Watts (depending on the day). It is not typically sold in standard Pokémon Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is generally gathered through raiding or the Galar region's unique Watt-based economy. Any Pokémon with high physical bulk is a prime candidate for this machine.
