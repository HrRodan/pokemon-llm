## Identity & Utility
**Sneasel Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Sneasel evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various TMs. Unlike the "Razor Claw," this item cannot be held by a Pokémon to influence critical hit ratios or trigger evolution.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily exchanged for League Points (LP) or used in recipes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific component in the crafting recipes for TMs. When combined with League Points and other materials, it allows the player to "print" certain moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "Materials" pocket of the bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression and customization item used in the overworld. It has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats outside of the initial acquisition of moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** trigger the evolution of Sneasel into Weavile or Sneasel-Hisui into Sneasler (those require the Razor Claw). It is strictly a resource for the Gen IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Sneasel** or **Weavile**. In the Paldea region, Sneasel are commonly found in snowy or mountainous biomes (such as Glaseado Mountain).
* **Wild Held Item:** While the JSON indicates 0% held rate for traditional "Held Items," this material is a **guaranteed drop** (usually 1–3 units) upon successfully battling the Sneasel line in Generation IX. It is a core component of the "treasure hunting" loop in the Paldean wilderness.
