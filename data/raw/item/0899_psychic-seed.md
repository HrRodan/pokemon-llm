## Identity & Utility
**Psychic Seed** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized "Terrain Seed" designed to be held by a Pokémon. It reacts to the environment, specifically triggering when the battlefield is under the effects of Psychic Terrain. It is a **Consumable** item that is used up once its effect is triggered.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; usually acquired via BP or specialized vendors in post-game areas).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder enters a battle where **Psychic Terrain** is active, or if Psychic Terrain is set while the holder is on the field, the item is consumed to raise the holder's **Special Defense by one stage (+50%)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; Flinging the item does not trigger the Special Defense boost).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-utility niche item in **VGC and Doubles** formats. It is most effectively paired with Pokémon possessing the **Psychic Surge** ability (like **Tapu Lele** or **Indeedee**). It is a premier choice for Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (e.g., Hawlucha, Sneasler, or Drifblim), as it provides a defensive buff while simultaneously doubling the user's Speed upon consumption.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It is hard-countered by the ability **Klutz** (which prevents the item from triggering) or the move **Knock Off** (which removes the item before the terrain can activate it).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in Alolan and Galar region Battle Shops. In more recent regions like Paldea, it can be purchased at Delibird Presents after certain gym milestones.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is occasionally found on wild **Exeggcute** (5% chance). Players seeking to farm these seeds often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability to identify the item and **Covet** or **Thief** to steal it.
* **Lore context:** Part of a quartet of seeds (Electric, Grassy, Misty, and Psychic) that represent the elemental and psychic energies of the Alolan Guardian Deities (the Tapus).
