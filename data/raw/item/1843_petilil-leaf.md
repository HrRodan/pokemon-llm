## Identity & Utility
**Petilil Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed or harvested from the Petilil evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. It is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency or League Points (LP), its value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific requirement for crafting Grass-type Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. When combined with League Points (LP) and other materials, it allows the player to "print" permanent move-teaching items. Typical TMs associated with this material include those Petilil or Lilligant can learn, such as **Energy Ball** or **Solar Beam**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely within the "out-of-battle" team-building loop. It is essential for competitive preparation (obtaining the necessary moves for a team) but has no tactical application during a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the Pokémon rather than a catalyst for its growth.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Petilil** or **Lilligant**. It can also be found as a sparkling pickup on the ground in habitats where these Pokémon reside (typically floral or forest biomes).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" in the sense of a Choice Band or Berry, it is part of the modern "Loot" mechanic. Players farming for specific TM moves will often target clusters of wild Petilil in the Paldean meadows to mass-collect these leaves.
