## Identity & Utility
**Tiny Bamboo Shoot** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A small, edible bamboo shoot that is primarily valued as a crafting ingredient or a commodity for sale. In the Hisui region, it is categorized as a "treasure" or "material" rather than a traditional held item or medicine. It is a **Consumable/Crafting** item that **can** be bought from specific vendors (like the Ginkgo Guild) or sold to shopkeepers.
* **Cost:** 375 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It serves as a minor source of income during early-to-mid-game exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is used as a core ingredient in **Crafting Recipes**. Most notably, it is required to craft **Bean Cakes**, which are effective at attracting certain types of wild Pokémon (specifically bird-like or fish-like Pokémon depending on the recipe mix).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine where the move 'Fling' is not present in its traditional form).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item is exclusive to the Hisui region's crafting and catching mechanics and has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for crafting lures or for liquidation into currency.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in the **Obsidian Fieldlands** and **Cobalt Coastlands** of the Hisui region. It is typically gathered by hand from the ground or obtained by sending a Pokémon to strike shaking trees.
* **Wild Held Item/Drops:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is frequently dropped by wild **Paras** and **Parasect** upon being defeated or caught. It is synonymous with the lush, forested environments of ancient Sinnoh.
