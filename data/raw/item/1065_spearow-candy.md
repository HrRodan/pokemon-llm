## Identity & Utility
**Spearow Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** This is a consumable medicine packed with energy designed specifically for the Spearow evolutionary line. It is used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's performance through the "Awakening" mechanic. As a consumable, it is used directly from the bag on a compatible Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal sell value, its primary worth is in its statistical utility rather than as a source of income.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Spearow** or **Fearow**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These bonuses are known as **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Items in the *Let's Go* series cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item does not exist in standard competitive formats (Smogon or VGC). It is exclusive to the *Let's Go* titles, where it is essential for "maxing out" a Spearow or Fearow for in-game battles or Master Trainer challenges.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Rare Candies or Exp. Candies, this does not grant levels. It is restricted strictly to the **Spearow line**. Using these candies is the most efficient way to reach the 200-stat-bonus cap for each attribute in the *Let's Go* engine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item cannot be traditionally purchased at Poké Marts. It is primarily earned through gameplay loop activities:
    1. **Catching:** Catching wild Spearow or Fearow frequently rewards the player with their specific candy.
    2. **Transferring:** Sending Spearow or Fearow to Professor Oak grants Spearow Candies in exchange.
    3. **Walking:** Using the Poké Ball Plus accessory to take a Spearow/Fearow for a stroll in the real world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is instead a reward for the act of capturing them, representing the "effort" or "essence" of that specific species. Consistently catching the same species (Catch Combos) significantly increases the drop rate of these candies.
