## Identity & Utility
**Large-leek** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A culinary component used exclusively for cooking at Pokémon Camp. While it resembles the stalk carried by Farfetch’d, it is functionally distinct from the "Leek" held item used for battle. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased from specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 2200 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Priced/Standard Ingredient**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Pokémon Camp "Curry Rice" minigame, it acts as the main ingredient to create various types of curry (notably **Leek Curry**). Consuming the resulting curry restores Pokémon HP/PP, grants Experience Points, and increases Friendship/Sociability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as its effects are restricted to the overworld camp mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Unlike the standard "Leek" (formerly known as the "Stick"), the **Large-leek** provides no critical-hit ratio bonus to Farfetch'd or Sirfetch'd and cannot be held for a competitive benefit.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased from **Ingredient Sellers** located throughout the Galar Wild Area, the Isle of Armor, and the Crown Tundra. Their inventory rotates daily, making the Large-leek a semi-regular find.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through the Galar regional economy or found as hidden sparkling items in the Wild Area.
* **Flavor Lore:** The item's description playfully questions if this vegetable is the same species favored by Farfetch’d. In-game mechanics clarify the distinction: the Large-leek is for the trainer's pot, while the smaller "Leek" is for the Pokémon's martial prowess.
