## Identity & Utility
**TR16 (Waterfall)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that teaches the move **Waterfall**. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, TRs are consumed upon use, mirroring the mechanics of early-generation Technical Machines. It is a **Consumable** item used to provide high-tier offensive coverage to Physical attackers.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive). While it has a high sell/buy price in standard currency, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** via Watt Traders in the Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Waterfall** to a compatible Pokémon. Waterfall is a Physical Water-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a **20% chance to make the target flinch**, making it highly effective on faster Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR without teaching the move.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Waterfall is the gold-standard Physical Water-type move for many high-tier threats such as **Gyarados, Dracovish, and Urshifu-Rapid-Strike**. Its reliability and flinch chance make it a preferred choice over moves with lower accuracy (like Aqua Tail).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used to optimize the move pools of Physical attackers that require Water-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR16 is primarily obtained by defeating Water-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a fluctuating price (typically 3,000 - 5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically farmed through raid den progression or the "Cram-o-matic" in the Isle of Armor expansion.
* **World Knowledge:** Historically, Waterfall was an **HM (Hidden Machine)** used for overworld navigation (climbing waterfalls). In Generation VIII, TR16 serves as the primary method to obtain this move now that HMs have been retired.
