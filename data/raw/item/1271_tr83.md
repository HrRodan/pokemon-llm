## Identity & Utility
**TR83 (Ally Switch)** is a **Machine (Technical Record)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that teaches the move **Ally Switch**. Unlike traditional TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic high-stakes inventory management of earlier generations.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard). While it has a base price, it is most commonly acquired via specialized currency (Watts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Ally Switch**, a Psychic-type status move. When used in a Double Battle, the user switches places with its partner on the field.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; provides no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **VGC/Doubles Staple.** Ally Switch is a high-priority (+2) move that defines the competitive doubles landscape. It is used to force "mind games," allowing a trainer to move a vulnerable Pokémon out of harm's way by swapping it with a bulkier ally. It is frequently seen on Support or Trick Room archetypes (e.g., Dusclops, Porygon2, or Rotom). In Singles, the move has no effect and the item is useless.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time consumable move-tutor substitute.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR83 is primarily obtained in *Pokémon Sword & Shield* by defeating Psychic-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (usually 3,000–5,000 Watts). It can also be generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Its acquisition is strictly tied to Raid rewards or specialized Galar-region commerce, marking it as a piece of "lost technology" retrieved from the Max Lair and Den ecosystems.
