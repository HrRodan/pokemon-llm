## Identity & Utility
**Grassy Seed** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized seed that reacts to environmental conditions. It is a **consumable held item** that is automatically used when the battlefield is covered in Grassy Terrain. Once the effect triggers, the item is consumed and cannot be used again during that battle (unless recycled).
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Specialized cost**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder enters the battle while **Grassy Terrain** is active, or if Grassy Terrain is activated while the holder is already on the field, the item is consumed to raise the holder’s **Defense by one stage** (+1 Def).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; generally not recommended for Fling-based strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a staple in **VGC and Smogon** formats, particularly when paired with teammates possessing the **Grassy Maker** ability (most notably **Rillaboom**). 
    * **Synergy:** It is frequently used by Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (e.g., Drifblim, Hawlucha, or Sneasler). Consuming the seed provides a defensive cushion while simultaneously doubling the Pokémon's Speed due to Unburden.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions as part of a cycle of four "Terrain Seeds" (Electric, Psychic, Misty, and Grassy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at specialized late-game shops (like the Battle Tree or specialized marts in later regions) or found as hidden items in lush, forested areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item can be found in the wild held by members of the **Bounsweet**, **Steenee**, and **Tsareena** lines. It is efficiently gathered using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or via the **Pickup** ability in certain games.
