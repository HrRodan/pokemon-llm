## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (lyr7001)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Once used, a specific Pokémon (in this case, typically Larvitar) appears as a Dynamax encounter until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot** be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; the cost is a placeholder value as these are distributed via Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area and consumes this crystal, it forcefully activates a Max Raid Battle. This allows the player to encounter and potentially catch a specific Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld mechanic of initiating Raid Battles to facilitate Pokémon acquisition. It has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is a key tool for obtaining Pokémon with guaranteed high individual values (IVs) and potential Hidden Abilities, which are essential for breeding competitive teams.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **Promotional Item**. The `lyr7001` variant was specifically distributed as a bonus for purchasing the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield* Dual Pack or through specific regional pre-order retail promotions (such as the "★And15" serial code).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively acquired via "Mystery Gift" serial codes.
* **Usage Context:** In the Galar region lore, these crystals are highly rare fragments of Wishing Stars that react specifically with the energy localized at the Watchtower Lair, a defunct Pokémon Den.
