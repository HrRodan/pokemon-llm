## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LEP1865** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It causes a specific, often rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon to appear as a raid boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that **cannot** be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this is a placeholder value as the item is traditionally acquired via serial codes or promotional distributions rather than Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific den in the East Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it generates a red beam/pillar of light. This initiates a Max Raid Battle with a predetermined Pokémon (often tied to specific retail promotions, such as Gigantamax Copperajah, Centiskorch, or Corviknight). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the "overworld" raid mechanic to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon or the farming of Raid rewards (TRs, Exp. Candies, and Berries).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is frequently used to provide access to Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which cannot be obtained through standard evolution without the Max Soup (found in the Isle of Armor DLC).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Exclusive item**. It was typically distributed via serial codes provided by retailers (such as GameStop, GAME, or EB Games) as pre-order bonuses or special "In-Store" promotions for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique digital distribution item that cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or other in-game farming methods.
