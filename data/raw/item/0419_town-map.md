## Identity & Utility
**Town Map** is a **Gameplay / Key Item** introduced in **Generation I** (with the provided data context originating from **Generation III**).
* **Description:** A very convenient navigational tool that can be viewed at any time from the Bag. It functions as a permanent reference for the region’s geography, displaying the trainer's current coordinates, visited locations, and landmarks. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the overworld, it opens a full-screen graphical interface displaying the regional map. It highlights the trainer’s current position, identifies major towns, cities, and routes, and displays specific points of interest such as Pokémon Gyms.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) and is purely for overworld navigation and progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. However, it is mechanically significant for tracking **Roaming Pokémon** (e.g., Latios/Latias or the Legendary Beasts) in various generations, as their current locations are often projected onto the map interface.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained as a gift early in the journey from a primary NPC, such as the Rival’s sibling (e.g., Daisy Oak in Kanto) or a guide NPC in the starting town. It is essential for players to orient themselves within the game world.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item designated for the player character.
