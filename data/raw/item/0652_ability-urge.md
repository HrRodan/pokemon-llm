## Identity & Utility
**Ability Urge** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Used during battle to forcibly trigger the activation of an ally Pokémon's Ability. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that cannot be bought with standard currency; it is tied exclusively to the Gen V "Wonder Launcher" (Miracle Shooter) mechanic.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired by accumulating points during battles where the Wonder Launcher setting is enabled.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon in battle, it targets a random friendly ally. If that ally possesses an Ability that is triggered by a specific condition (e.g., "On Entry" abilities like **Intimidate** or **Download**), that effect is immediately re-activated. It does not function on passive/continuous abilities like *Levitate* or *Guts*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Standard/Gimmick.** This item is entirely excluded from standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon) because it requires the "Wonder Launcher" battle mode to be active. It was designed specifically for "Item-On" multiplayer matches in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It has no effect on evolution. Its utility is strictly limited to Double or Triple Battles where an ally is present to receive the "Urge."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available only in Generation V. It is obtained via the **Wonder Launcher** menu during a battle once the player has accumulated the required number of points (turns elapsed). It cannot be found in Poke Marts or in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital manifestation of the Wonder Launcher system and does not exist as a physical item in the player's standard inventory bag.
