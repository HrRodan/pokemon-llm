## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Scarf** is a **Scarf** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An accessory to be held by a Pokémon. It is specifically designed for Pokémon Contests, boosting the "Tough" condition of the holder. It is a **Held Item** that is technically purchasable but primarily functions as a specialized performance tool.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the Pokémon’s **Toughness** rating during the Visual Competition phase of a Pokémon Contest or Super Contest. This directly increases the number of points (hearts) received from the audience/judges before moves are even performed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Combat.** This item provides no benefit in standard Smogon or VGC formats. It is exclusively a "Contest Staple" for players aiming to win Master Rank Toughness Ribbons.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It specifically interacts with the **Contest/Condition** mechanics. In many games, its effectiveness is tied to the Pokémon's existing Tough stat (maximized via Yellow Pokéblocks or Poffins).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift rather than a retail purchase. In its debut generation, it is acquired by showing a Pokémon with a high "Tough" condition to the **Pokémon Fan Club Chairman** in Slateport City.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is considered a specialized gear item for coordinators.
