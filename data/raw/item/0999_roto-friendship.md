## Identity & Utility
**Roto Friendship** is a **Rotom Power** (Utility Consumable) introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** It is a special power-up granted by the Rotom Dex. When activated, it emits a field effect that causes Pokémon in the player's party to gain friendship (happiness) at an accelerated rate. It is a **Consumable Utility** item that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). It is earned exclusively through the Roto Loto mechanic.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the multiplier for friendship-raising actions (such as walking, leveling up, or using items) for a set duration. This significantly reduces the time required to reach the high friendship thresholds needed for specific evolutions or moves like Return.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in the Rotom Power pocket and cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Rotom Powers are restricted to the overworld and single-player campaign. They cannot be used in Link Battles, Battle Tree, or VGC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is a high-value utility for trainers looking to evolve "Friendship Evolution" Pokémon (e.g., **Golbat** into **Crobat**, **Type: Null** into **Silvally**, or **Eevee** into **Espeon/Umbreon/Sylveon**) quickly during a playthrough.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a random prize from the **Roto Loto** mini-game, which triggers periodically on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS when the Rotom Dex’s eyes flash gold.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is unique to the Alola region's Rotom Dex technology and is gathered solely through the bond between the trainer and their Pokédex.
