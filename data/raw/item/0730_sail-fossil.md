## Identity & Utility
**Sail Fossil** is a **Dex-completion / Fossil** item introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A prehistoric artifact containing the genetic material of an ancient land-dwelling Pokémon. It is characterized by an impression resembling a skin sail. This is a **Consumable Revival Item** that is technically sellable but typically acquired through exploration or choice-based events rather than standard Mart purchases.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high sell value, its primary worth lies in the unique Pokémon it produces.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specialized revival facility (such as the Fossil Lab in Ambrette Town or the Research Institute in Galar), the Sail Fossil is consumed to resurrect the Rock/Ice-type Pokémon **Amaura**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High). While it deals significant damage if thrown using the move **Fling**, doing so destroys the fossil and prevents the player from reviving it into a Pokémon.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Niche/Pre-game).** The item itself provides no benefit in battle. However, the resulting Pokémon, **Aurorus**, is notable in competitive lower tiers for its high HP and the **Refrigerate** ability, which converts Normal-type moves into Ice-type moves with a power boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item serves as the exclusive "trigger" for obtaining Amaura in its debut generation. It is the counterpart to the **Jaw Fossil** (which revives into Tyrunt); players are typically forced to choose one or the other during a standard playthrough.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is obtained in **Glittering Cave** as a one-time choice between it and the Jaw Fossil. In later generations (like *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon* or *Sword/Shield*), it can sometimes be found via hidden item mechanics, the Digging Duo, or specific version-exclusive shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be found as a hidden item, gifted by NPCs, or obtained through mining/exploration mini-games.
* **Lore Context:** The Sail Fossil represents the remains of an ancient creature that lived millions of years ago. It is the biological ancestor of Amaura and Aurorus, designed to mirror the real-world *Amargasaurus*, a sauropod known for the distinct neural spines along its neck that may have supported a skin sail.
