## Identity & Utility
**Squirtle Candy** is a **Species-Specific Stat Booster** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used to permanently increase the stats of specific Pokémon. Unlike standard vitamins, this item targets the entire evolutionary line simultaneously. It cannot be used in traditional core-series games (e.g., Sword/Shield or Scarlet/Violet).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal value, it is primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than being a standard Poké Mart staple.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a member of the **Squirtle evolutionary line** (Squirtle, Wartortle, or Blastoise), it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** each. These points contribute to the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* titles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is foundational for maximizing a Pokémon's potential in the *Let's Go* meta but is non-existent in VGC or standard Smogon formats, which utilize the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is not used for evolution. It is specifically designed to bypass the limitations of generic candies (Quick Candy, Tough Candy, etc.) by boosting all attributes at once, making it the most efficient way to "max out" a Blastoise.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by **catching wild Squirtle** or sending Squirtle to **Professor Oak** in the *Let's Go* series. It can also be earned as a reward from the Poké Ball Plus or by playing minigames in the GO Park.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is a reward-based item granted directly to the Trainer's inventory upon successful capture or transfer of the species.
* **Lore Context:** Introduced to bridge the mechanical gap between *Pokémon GO* (which uses species-specific candies) and the console RPGs, representing the focused training and "essence" of the Squirtle species.
