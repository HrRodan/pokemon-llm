## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AUR1612** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used specifically in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that remains active until the end of the day. It is categorized as a utility-based consumable tied to the Max Raid mechanic.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; typically **Not for sale** through standard in-game vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty Watchtower Lair, the crystal is consumed to force a Max Raid Battle to spawn. The specific Pokémon encountered is determined by the crystal's ID (in this case, the AUR1612 variant). These encounters are unique because they do not require Wishing Pieces and occur at a fixed location.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item functions exclusively in the overworld to facilitate encounters. However, the Pokémon caught via these raids often possess high IVs, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax potential, which are essential for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are typically distributed as **Event Items** via Mystery Gift serial codes. These codes were historically provided as pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack* or through retail distributions (such as GameStop or EB Games). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item intended for special promotional encounters.
* **Context:** Unlike standard Raid Dens that cycle randomly, the Dynamax Crystal provides a guaranteed encounter with a specific species, making it a highly valued item for collectors and Nuzlocke players looking for specific guaranteed encounters.
