## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (BOO5340)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is classified as a rare event-trigger item rather than a standard medicine or held item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**). Note: While it has a technical cost of 20, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts; this value is typically a placeholder for event-distributed items.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (in this case, **Stonjourner**, identified by the BOO5340 code) to appear in a Max Raid Battle. The raid remains active until the end of the calendar day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld meant for catching specific Pokémon or farming Max Raid rewards (like Exp. Candies and TMs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are typically distributed via **Mystery Gift codes** provided through retail promotions (e.g., GameStop, EB Games, or Amazon pre-order bonuses). They are not found through natural gameplay or in-game shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is an "External" item acquired through promotional distribution rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
* **World Knowledge:** The "BOO" series of Dynamax Crystals was specifically used for promotional encounters that allowed players to catch Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare. Specifically, the BOO5340 crystal was associated with the **Stonjourner** encounter, often paired with the BOO5341 crystal for Eiscue.
