## Identity & Utility
**TM190 (Solar Beam)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in the **Generation IX** titles, *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*.
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding device used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea region, TMs are single-use consumables that can be recreated using the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires League Points and materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Solar Beam** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Solar Beam (Move):** A high-power (120 BP), Special Grass-type move. It typically requires a charging turn (gathering light) before attacking on the second turn. However, if **Harsh Sunlight** is active, the move executes instantly. Its damage is halved in Rain, Sandstorm, or Snow.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Standard for most TM items).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Staple for Sun Teams.** Solar Beam is the premier Special Grass coverage for Fire-types and Sun-setters like Torkoal or Ninetales, allowing them to bypass Water and Ground-type threats instantly under sunlight. Outside of weather-dedicated teams, it is considered a high-risk "niche" move due to the vulnerability of the charging turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be crafted multiple times.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the overworld of the Paldea region (Scarlet/Violet) and its expansions (The Teal Mask/The Indigo Disk). Once the recipe is unlocked, it can be crafted at any Pokémon Center’s **TM Machine**.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To manufacture TM190, a trainer typically requires:
    * **10,000 League Points (LP)**
    * **Bounsweet Sweat** (x5)
    * **Tropius Leaf** (x3)
    * **Fomantis Leaf** (x3)
* **Wild Held Item:** TMs are not held by wild Pokémon; however, the materials required to craft TM190 are obtained by defeating or catching the **Bounsweet, Tropius, and Fomantis** evolutionary lines.
