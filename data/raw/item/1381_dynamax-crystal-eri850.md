## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (eri850)** is a **Special Event Item** (Categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, the designated Pokémon—in this case, typically a special encounter or Gigantamax form—will appear in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that is technically restricted and cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inexpensive/Placeholder**). While the data lists a nominal cost, these items are functionally priceless as they are typically distributed via serial codes or retail promotions rather than in-game shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, a pillar of light is generated. This initiates a **Max Raid Battle** against a specific Pokémon designated by the internal ID "eri850."
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for facilitating an encounter. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors, making them highly valuable for competitive breeding or team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It serves as a "Raid Trigger" that bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces for a specific, guaranteed encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through standard Marts or gameplay progression. It was distributed as a **special promotional bonus** (often via pre-order codes or retail distributions like those from GameStop, GAME, or CoroCoro). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is strictly an event-based inventory item delivered via the Mystery Gift "Get with Code/Password" feature.
* **Context:** In the lore of Galar, Dynamax Crystals are rare fragments that react with the Power Spots found in the Wild Area, forcing a specific Pokémon to Dynamax regardless of the natural raid cycle.
