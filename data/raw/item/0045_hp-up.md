## Identity & Utility
**HP Up** is a **Vitamin** (Permanent Stat Booster) introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** A nutritious, high-protein drink designed for Pokémon consumption. It is a **Consumable** item used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's durability by increasing its base HP stats. While it can be held, it has no passive effect in battle.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). It is a premium resource typically sold in major Department Stores.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon's **HP Effort Values (EVs)** by **10 points**. 
    * *Mechanical Note:* In older generations (Gen I–VII), it cannot be used if the Pokémon already has 100 or more HP EVs. In modern iterations (Gen VIII onwards), it can be used all the way up to the maximum cap of 252 EVs.
    * **Happiness:** Provides a minor boost to friendship (5 points for low friendship, 3 for mid-range, and 2 for high friendship).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** HP Up is a fundamental tool for competitive teambuilding, allowing players to bypass tedious wild-Pokémon grinding to "max out" the HP investment of a competitive Pokémon quickly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution, but is a core component of the "Vitamin" hierarchy (alongside Protein, Iron, Calcium, Zinc, and Carbos).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, Lilycove City) or the **Battle Frontier/Battle Tree** for BP. In recent generations, it can also be found via the Vending Machines in various regions or as a reward in Max Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through commercial purchase, as hidden items in the overworld, or occasionally gathered by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at higher levels (though rare).
