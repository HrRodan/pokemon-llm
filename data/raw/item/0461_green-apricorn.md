## Identity & Utility
**Green Apricorn** is an **Apricorn-Box** item introduced in **Generation II** (and featured prominently in the Generation IV Johto remakes).
* **Description:** A green, aromatic fruit that serves as a specialized crafting material. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can technically be valued at 200 Poké Dollars, though it is primarily harvested from the environment rather than purchased in bulk at standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When given to the master craftsman **Kurt in Azalea Town**, it is processed over a 24-hour period to create a **Friend Ball**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The item itself provides no tactical benefit in battle. Its utility is strictly restricted to the "out-of-battle" economy of Poké Ball production.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, the resulting **Friend Ball** has a significant impact on evolution mechanics: any Pokémon caught in a Friend Ball has its base **Friendship (Happiness)** immediately set to 200. This significantly fastens the evolution process for species that evolve via high friendship (e.g., Chansey, Golbat, Eevee).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily gathered from **Green Apricorn trees** found throughout the Johto region (notably on Route 30, Route 33, Route 35, and Route 42). In games like *HeartGold* and *SoulSilver*, these are stored in the specialized **Apricorn Box** to save inventory space.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via environmental interaction or gifted by NPCs. In some generations, it can be obtained via the **Pickup** ability at specific level tiers or through the Pokéathlon Dome in exchange for points.
