## Identity & Utility
**HM06 (Hidden Machine 06)** is a **Machine** (Hidden Machine) introduced in **Generation II**.
* **Description:** An infinite-use technical device used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in older generations, HMs are permanent, non-consumable, and historically required a "Move Deleter" to remove. It is a **Key Utility** item that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; obtained via NPCs or environmental discovery).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. The specific move taught by HM06 varies significantly by region/generation:
    * **Generation II:** Teaches **Whirlpool**.
    * **Generations III & IV:** Teaches **Rock Smash**.
    * **Note on Modernity:** In later generations (e.g., *Sun/Moon* onwards), HMs were phased out in favor of "Ride Pokémon," though the moves themselves often transitioned into TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Rock Smash (Gen III/IV):** Very low competitive viability due to low base power (40), though it has a niche 50% chance to lower the target's Defense.
        * **Whirlpool (Gen II):** Niche use in "Trapping" sets to prevent opponents from switching out while dealing chip damage.
        * **Dive:** Generally considered non-viable in high-level play due to being a two-turn move that is easily exploited by the opponent.
* **Overworld Interaction:** This item is essential for progression. In its most common form (**Rock Smash**), it allows the player to shatter cracked boulders blocking paths, occasionally revealing wild Pokémon (like Geodude) or items underneath.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually gifted by key NPCs. For example, in the Hoenn region (Gen III), it is provided by an NPC in Mauville City; in Sinnoh (Gen IV), it is given by a Hiker at the entrance of Oreburgh Gate.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique tool provided to the Trainer to facilitate regional exploration.
* **Legacy Context:** HM06 represents a "Gatekeeping" mechanic in classic Pokémon games, where players cannot access new routes or caves until they have obtained this machine and defeated the corresponding Gym Leader to authorize its use outside of battle.
