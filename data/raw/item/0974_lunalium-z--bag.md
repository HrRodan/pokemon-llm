## Identity & Utility
**Lunalium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (categorized here as a Bag Item) introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that resonates with the Z-Power Ring. It is designed specifically to upgrade the move Moongeist Beam into a powerful, exclusive Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Item-adjacent permanent tool** that cannot be sold, traded, or consumed.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Lunala** or **Dawn Wings Necrozma** that knows the move **Moongeist Beam**, it allows the Pokémon to unleash the Z-Move **Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom**. 
    * **Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom:** A Ghost-type physical or special attack (depending on the base move) with a base power of **200**. Crucially, this move ignores the effects of the target's Ability (e.g., Sturdy, Multiscale, or Disguise).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Niche.** In Generation VII competitive formats (specifically Ubers), this item was the standard choice for Lunala and Dawn Wings Necrozma. It provided a one-time nuke that bypassed defensive abilities like Lugia's Multiscale or Shadow Shield, often securing critical KOs in the legendary-heavy tier.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It requires a **Z-Power Ring** or **Z-Ring** to function. It is specific only to Lunala and its fused form with Necrozma; it cannot be used by other Ghost-type Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, the player receives this crystal at the **Lake of the Moone** (or Lake of the Sunne) after the climax of the Necrozma storyline, typically involving the capture or receipt of Lunala.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, singular artifact tied to the lore of the Alolan "Light Trio" (Solgaleo, Lunala, and Necrozma).
* **Context:** Unlike generic Z-Crystals (like Ghostium Z), the Lunalium Z is a "Species-Specific" Z-Crystal, representing the peak of Lunala's lunar energy.
