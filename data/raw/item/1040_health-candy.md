## Identity & Utility
**Health Candy** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically appearing in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A specialized energy-packed snack used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's physical condition. Unlike traditional vitamins like HP Up, this item is part of the "Candy" mechanic used to increase a Pokémon's **Awakened Values (AVs)**. It is a consumable item that can be bought or earned through gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Highly Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it increases its **HP stat by 1 point** via the AV system. It can be used on any Pokémon regardless of level, up to a maximum of 200 AVs in the HP stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held items are not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Context-Specific.** In the *Let's Go* competitive ecosystem, Health Candies are essential for "No Restrictions" battles to maximize bulk. However, in "Standard Rules" online play, AVs are set to zero, rendering the effects of this item void.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is the base-tier candy in the Health hierarchy. It is typically used for Pokémon from Level 1 and up. As the Pokémon's AVs increase, the player must eventually transition to using **Health Candy L** (Level 30+) and **Health Candy XL** (Level 60+) to continue stat growth.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Professor Oak:** Primarily acquired by "transferring" captured Pokémon to Professor Oak. Sending multiple Pokémon of the same species often yields specific candies.
    * **Catching Pokémon:** Occasionally awarded as a bonus for successful captures, especially during Catch Combos.
    * **Walking:** Can be found by a Pokémon strolling in a **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. In the *Let's Go* series, wild Pokémon do not hold items; instead, the player earns these candies as rewards for the capture itself, effectively replacing the "farming" of held items found in other generations.
