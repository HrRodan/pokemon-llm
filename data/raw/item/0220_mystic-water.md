## Identity & Utility
**Mystic Water** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in Generation II (standardized in Gen III data).
* **Description:** A teardrop-shaped gem that resonates with aquatic energy. It is a **Held Item** that provides a passive offensive buff to the holder. While it has a defined internal cost, it is typically found through exploration or as a wild held item rather than purchased in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the base power of the holder’s **Water-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **niche offensive item**. While items like *Life Orb* or *Choice Specs* provide higher damage multipliers (30% and 50% respectively), Mystic Water is preferred when the trainer wants to boost Water-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves without incurring recoil damage or being locked into a single move. It is occasionally seen in VGC on rain-dependent attackers like **Kyogre** or **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike** to maximize *Water Spout* or *Surging Strikes* damage without the drawbacks of other items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its effect is purely mathematical during the damage calculation phase.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found near bodies of water or gifted by NPCs near docks and seas. In most regions, it is a one-time find in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is a signature held item for several aquatic species. It can be farmed from wild **Goldeen**, **Seaking**, **Lapras**, **Dewpider**, and **Araquanid**. It is also notably held by **Castform** (especially in its Rainy form). Trainers often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability or moves like **Thief/Covet** to acquire multiple copies from these wild encounters.
