## Identity & Utility
**Primarium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized Z-Crystal designed specifically for the Pokémon Primarina. It converts Z-Power to allow the user to upgrade a specific signature move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Item/Special Acquisition** that cannot be sold or traded in a traditional sense.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is obtained through story progression or specific NPC interactions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Primarina** that knows the move **Sparkling Aria**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Oceanic Operetta**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed from the holder by moves like Knock Off or Thief).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Generation VII niche).** In the Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon meta, Oceanic Operetta served as a massive, single-use Water-type nuke (Base Power 195). It was used to bypass traditional checks or secure OHKOs on bulky threats that Primarina otherwise couldn't break through with standard STAB moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-enhancement tool. It bypasses effects like *Klutz* (which prevents the use of held items) specifically in the context of activating Z-Moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon* and *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, the player receives this item as a gift. If the player chose Popplio as their starter, they typically receive it from Hau after defeating him at a specific point in the story (post-game or during the Malie City events); if they did not choose Popplio, it is often acquired from an NPC in the post-game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item tied to the player's Bag/Key Items collection.
* **Lore Context:** The Primarium Z represents the deep bond between a Trainer and their Primarina, focusing the Z-Power of the Alola region into a performance-based offensive maneuver.
