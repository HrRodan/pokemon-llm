## Identity & Utility
**Roto Boost** is a **Rotom Power (Consumable Battle Item)** introduced in **Generation VII (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon)**.
* **Description:** One of the exclusive "Roto Powers" granted by the Rotom Dex. It is a consumable battle utility item that provides a massive multi-stat buff to the active Pokémon. While categorized internally as "unused" in some databases, it is a fully functional mechanic within the Alola region's enhanced versions.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a special reward that cannot be purchased at Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag during a battle, Roto Boost increases the active Pokémon's **Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each** (+1 "Omniboost").
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Prohibited.** As a "Bag Item," Roto Boost is restricted to in-game story play. It cannot be used in the Battle Tree, VGC, or standard Smogon formats. It is widely considered a "win button" for difficult story encounters, such as the fight against Ultra Necrozma.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a temporary battle modifier that wears off if the Pokémon is swapped out or the battle ends.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively through the **Roto Loto** feature in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*. Players trigger the Roto Loto by interacting with the Rotom Dex on the lower screen when its eyes flash gold. The prizes are randomized, making Roto Boost a high-value pull from the lottery.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital manifestation of the bond between the trainer and their Rotom Pokédex, rather than a physical object found in the world.
