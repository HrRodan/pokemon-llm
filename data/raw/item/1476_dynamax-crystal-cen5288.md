## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CEN5288** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a rare, single-use consumable event item. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Galar, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is an event-exclusive item that cannot be purchased through standard in-game marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; practically priceless as it is typically obtained via serial code distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to summon a specific **Gigantamax Pokémon** raid. Specifically, the CEN5288 crystal is designated to summon **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is strictly an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, it is high-utility for competitive players looking to acquire a Sandaconda with the G-Max Factor and potentially its Hidden Ability (*Sand Veil*) or specific IV spreads for Trick Room or defensive utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the "Watchtower Lair" map node. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, this crystal guarantees a specific species encounter regardless of the den's natural spawn pool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a promotional tie-in. These were typically handed out via serial codes at retailers (such as GameStop or Micromania) or through special CoroCoro magazine distributions to promote the *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* expansions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or Thief-style moves.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. While most Dynamax energy is localized to Power Spots, these crystals allow a trainer to manually "charge" a dormant den to force a Gigantamax phenomenon to occur on command.
