## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a Picnic, this item acts as a container or ingredient component for the **Sandwich-making** mini-game. Depending on the specific recipe it is included in, it contributes toward the activation of **Meal Powers**, which provide various overworld buffs such as increased Shiny rates (Sparkling Power), higher encounter rates (Encounter Power), or faster Egg discovery (Egg Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 0 (This item cannot be used effectively with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item designed for the Paldean overworld and has no function in Smogon, VGC, or standard trainer battles. It is highly valued by **Shiny Hunters** and **Breeders** for its role in generating Meal Powers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly tied to the Picnic system and does not interact with battle-related abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at dedicated culinary and picnic supply outlets throughout the Paldea region, most notably at **Deli Cioso**, **Every Wich Way**, and **Aquiesta Supermarket** locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is an industrially manufactured product for trainers, generally obtained via currency exchange rather than foraging.
