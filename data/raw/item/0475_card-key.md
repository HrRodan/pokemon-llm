## Identity & Utility
**Card Key** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in Generation I (refined in Generation III).
* **Description:** An electronic security card designed to override localized lock systems. As a Key Item, it is stored in a specialized pocket of the Bag and cannot be consumed, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It is essential for bypassing environmental puzzles within Team Rocket-controlled facilities.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to locked electronic doors within specific corporate or media headquarters. 
    * **Kanto (Gen I/III):** Unlocks the security shutters throughout the **Silph Co. Head Office** in Saffron City, allowing the player to navigate the 11-floor complex to defeat Giovanni.
    * **Johto (Gen II/IV):** Opens the shutters in the **Goldenrod Radio Tower**, which is necessary to reach the top floors and clear out the Team Rocket remnants.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a pure narrative progression tool with no utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual battling.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or trigger any combat abilities. Its interaction is strictly limited to the overworld environment.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **In Kanto:** Typically found on the **5th Floor of Silph Co.** (left-hand side of the central hallway). Obtaining it is the "turning point" of the Silph Co. dungeon, as it allows the player to bypass the warp-tile maze.
    * **In Johto:** Received from the **Radio Tower Director** (or the imposter) after clearing specific floors or events during the Team Rocket takeover.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind asset tied to the game's story arc.
