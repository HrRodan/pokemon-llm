## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CAS542** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use mission item primarily distributed through promotional events or serial codes.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap value**, though functionally not available for purchase at standard in-game Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins) causes a specific Pokémon—determined by the crystal's ID—to appear as a **Max Raid Battle** boss. This allows players to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld utility item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. This item has no direct impact on competitive battling but is a vital tool for collectors and competitive players to acquire specific Pokémon with fixed high IVs, Hidden Abilities, or Egg Moves through Raids.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon the successful activation of the Watchtower Lair den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** or special promotional events (such as pre-order bonuses or retail distributions). Unlike standard items, these cannot be found through normal gameplay or "Pickup" mechanics.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **World Knowledge Context:** "CAS" usually denotes a specific internal event ID. In the Galar region, these crystals were often used for early-game access to Pokémon like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax-capable species. Because the raid lasts until the end of the day, players can repeatedly attempt the battle if they fail, but the item is spent once the raid is initiated.
