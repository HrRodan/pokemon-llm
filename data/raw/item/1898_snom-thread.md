## Identity & Utility
**Snom Thread** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Snom evolutionary line. As a specialized material, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag and is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold, but not bought at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While its sell price is low, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent rather than its monetary worth.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea, Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy regions. It serves as "bio-matter" required to replicate certain Ice-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle; has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on battle stats, abilities, or moves. It is purely a utility item for movepool expansion during the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it is a thread-like material, it is **not** an evolution item (Snom evolves via high Friendship at night). It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Snom family. It is a common drop in snowy biomes like Glaseado Mountain.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item, but a guaranteed reward dropped by:
    * **Snom**
    * **Frosmoth** 
* **Lore Context:** The thread is the silk-like substance produced by Snom, which it uses to anchor itself or weave protective layers. In the context of Gen IX's "TM Machine" lore, this biological material is processed into data to help Pokémon learn complex Ice-type techniques such as **Ice Beam** or **Icy Wind**.
