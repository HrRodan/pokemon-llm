## Identity & Utility
**Incinium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (categorized as a Key Item in the inventory) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This specialized crystal is designed to convert Z-Power to enhance the capabilities of the Pokémon **Incineroar**. It specifically upgrades the move **Darkest Lariat** into a unique, signature Z-Move. It is a **Key Item** that is **not for sale** and cannot be consumed; once acquired, it remains in the Bag to be equipped by the player's Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Incineroar** that knows the move **Darkest Lariat**, it allows the Pokémon to perform the exclusive Z-Move: **Malicious Moonsault**. This move is a powerful Dark-type physical attack (Base Power: 180) that ignores the target’s stat changes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed from the holder by moves like Knock Off or Thief.
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically a **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017-2019 and Smogon). While Incineroar later transitioned into a premier support role with Intimidate and Fake Out, Incinium Z allowed it to serve as a high-damage "nuke," capable of bypassing defensive boosts to secure crucial KOs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-enhancement tool. It interacts with the **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** held by the trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, the player receives this crystal from Professor Kukui after defeating him/becoming the Champion (if Litten was the starter) or from Hau in Malie Garden. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained during the main story in Malie Garden after defeating Guzma.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique story-related item tied to the Alolan starter Pokémon progression. Since it is a Key Item/Z-Crystal, it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
