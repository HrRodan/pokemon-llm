## Identity & Utility
**Grimer Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** This candy is a specialized consumable used to permanently enhance the power of a specific evolutionary line. It is packed with energy and, when fed to a compatible Pokémon, boosts all of its stats simultaneously. As a species-specific item, it is designed for Grimer and its evolution, Muk (including their Alolan forms). 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, though it is rarely purchased and instead earned through gameplay mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases all six stats (**HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed**) of a Grimer or Muk by +1 Awakening Value (AV) per candy. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in the Fling mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* engine. In that environment, it is essential for "Maxing" a Pokémon, as AVs function differently than traditional EVs (Effort Values). It allows a Grimer or Muk to reach its absolute ceiling of power, far exceeding what is possible in standard core-series games.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is intended for use on Grimer and Muk. It circumvents the need for individual stat candies (like Tough Candy or Quick Candy) by providing a comprehensive boost in a single use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Grimer Candy is primarily obtained through the **Catch Combo** mechanic and the **Pokémon Box** transfer system. Players receive these candies by catching many Grimer in a row or by sending caught Grimer to Professor Oak. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; rather, it is "dropped" as a reward for capturing or transferring them. It can also be obtained by walking a Grimer or Muk in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Context:** In the Kanto region of *Let's Go*, this represents the "distilled essence" of the Grimer species, used by trainers to bypass traditional training and rapidly power up their Pokémon.
