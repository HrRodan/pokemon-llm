## Identity & Utility
**Max Potion** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A high-grade spray-type medicine designed for treating severe wounds. It is a consumable item usable both in the overworld and during battle to completely restore a Pokémon's health. Within the healing hierarchy, it sits as the penultimate stage of HP restoration, superior to the Hyper Potion but lacking the status-curing properties of the Full Restore.
* **Cost:** 2500 Poké Dollars (Expensive/High-tier).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Fully restores the target Pokémon's HP to its maximum value, regardless of how much damage it has taken. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a staple for **main-story playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**, particularly during the Elite Four. However, it has **zero utility in competitive PvP (VGC/Smogon)** as direct healing medicines are banned in standard formats, where "Held Items" like Leftovers or Sitrus Berries are required for HP recovery.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a target for the "Pickup" ability at high levels (typically level 50+) in various titles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually becomes available for purchase at Pokémon Marts and the Pokémon League after the player has acquired a specific number of Gym Badges (typically the 7th or 8th badge). It can also be found as a hidden item in late-game areas like Victory Road.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Players often farm this item using the **Pickup** ability with high-level Pokémon (such as Linoone or Ambipom) in the post-game to stock up for battle facilities.
