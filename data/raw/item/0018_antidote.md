## Identity & Utility
**Antidote** is a **Consumable Medicine** (Status-cure) introduced in Generation I (though indexed here via Generation III).
* **Description:** A spray-type medicine designed to treat poisoning. It is a consumable item that can be used both during battle to maintain momentum and in the overworld to prevent periodic damage (in older generations) or to clear the status icon. It is highly accessible and can be bought at almost any Poké Mart.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Cures a single Pokémon of the **Poison** or **Badly Poisoned** status conditions. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; provides no additional effect when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Low/Story-only.** In competitive play (VGC/Smogon), direct status-cure items like Antidote are unusable because trainers cannot use items from their bag. For status management in competitive play, players utilize the **Lum Berry** (held item) or moves like **Heal Bell** and **Refresh**. It is, however, a staple for **Nuzlocke** challenges and early-game playthroughs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. While it is "holdable," it provides no benefit to a Pokémon in battle as a held item (unlike a Berry).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at all Poké Marts starting from the very first town in almost every region. It represents the most basic tier of status recovery, sitting below the **Full Heal** (which cures all statuses) and the **Full Restore** (which cures all statuses and restores HP).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon in the current dataset. It is frequently found as a common floor item in early-game forests (e.g., Viridian Forest, Petalburg Woods) where Poison-type Pokémon are prevalent.
