## Identity & Utility
**TM109 (Trick)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current numbering within **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**, specifically appearing in the *The Indigo Disk* DLC expansion.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the Psychic-type move **Trick** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced at a TM Machine. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using the TM Machine system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Trick**. When used in battle, Trick causes the user and the target to **swap their held items**. If neither Pokémon is holding an item, or if the target is protected by specific abilities or item-locking mechanics (like Mega Stones or certain Z-Crystals), the move fails.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (As a TM, it cannot be held or flung; the taught move, Trick, interacts with held items instead).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Trick is a cornerstone of competitive singles (Smogon) and a niche utility in VGC. It is primarily used by "Choiced" attackers (holding **Choice Scarf** or **Choice Specs**) to swap their restrictive item onto a defensive wall, effectively neutralizing the opponent's utility for the duration of the match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the **Sticky Hold** ability (prevents item swapping) and the **Klutz** ability (user can use Trick but cannot benefit from the item it receives).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item on the ground within the **Terarium** (specifically the Canyon or Polar Biomes) in the *The Indigo Disk* DLC. Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked for the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM109, the player requires:
    1. **5,000 LP** (League Points)
    2. **3x Shuppet Scrap**
    3. **3x Sinistea Chip**
* **Wild Held Item:** While the TM itself is not held by wild Pokémon, the materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Shuppet**, **Banette**, **Sinistea**, and **Polteageist**.
