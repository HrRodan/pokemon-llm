## Identity & Utility
**Gram 1** is a **Plot-Advancement** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** An important letter intended for delivery by a Wingull. It serves as a narrative-driven sidequest item rather than a functional tool or medicine. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; cannot be sold to Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When collected alongside **Gram 2** and **Gram 3**, the player can return the set to a specific Wingull located on **Unova Route 13**. Completing this delivery rewards the player with **TM89 (U-turn)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This is strictly a quest-related item used for progression and obtaining technical machines in a single-player playthrough.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its only interaction is with the quest-related NPC Wingull in the Unova region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a loose item (hidden or visible overworld sprite) on **Route 13** in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2,* and *White 2*. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-time acquisition per save file.
* **Context:** The "Gram" series (1, 2, and 3) represents lost mail. In the context of Unova's world-building, it highlights the role of Wingull as messengers between coastal areas, a nod to the species' lore established in the Hoenn region.
