## Identity & Utility
**Poison Barb** is a **Type-enhancement** held item introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A small, venomous spike designed to be held by a Pokémon. It provides a passive offensive buff to toxic techniques. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is technically purchasable but more commonly acquired through world exploration or wild encounters.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the power of the holder’s **Poison-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70. When used with the move **Fling**, the Poison Barb deals significant physical damage and is guaranteed to **Poison** the target.
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered a **Niche/Mid-tier** item. While the 20% boost is helpful for Poison-type specialists (like Roserade or Toxtricity) to secure OHKOs without the recoil of a Life Orb, it is often outclassed by more versatile items like *Choice Spec/Band* or *Black Sludge* (which provides recovery for Poison-types). It sees occasional play in "Monotype" formats or specific lower-tier strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts positively with the **Klutz** ability (which would negate its effects) and can be intercepted by **Thief** or **Knock Off**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in various Poison-themed locations (sewers, toxic wastes, or deep forests). It is often available for purchase in late-game specialized shops or at the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree for BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is highly farmable in the wild. It is held by 19 different species, most notably **Beedrill**, **Tentacruel**, **Roselia**, **Scolipede**, and **Toxapex**. 
* **Farming Tip:** Trainers can efficiently gather Poison Barbs by using a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability in the lead slot to increase hold rates, combined with **Thief** or **Covet**.
