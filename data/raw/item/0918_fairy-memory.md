## Identity & Utility
**Fairy Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** A high-tech memory disc containing Fairy-type data. It is a **Held Item** specifically designed for use with the Pokémon **Silvally**. While it has a defined cost, it is typically acquired as part of a unique set rather than purchased in bulk.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by Silvally, it triggers the **RKS System** ability, changing Silvally's base type to **Fairy**. Additionally, it changes the type of the move **Multi-Attack** to Fairy-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Low-tier. In competitive formats (like Smogon's NU or PU), the Fairy Memory is used to transform Silvally into a defensive pivot or a Fairy-type attacker. While Fairy is a top-tier defensive typing, Silvally-Fairy often competes with other Fairy types that can hold more versatile items like Leftovers or Choice Specs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is functionally useless on any Pokémon other than Silvally. It is part of a 17-item suite of Memories modeled after Arceus’s Plates, designed to allow Silvally to adapt to any combat scenario.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), the Fairy Memory is obtained as a gift from **Gladion** at the Aether Paradise after the player becomes Champion. In Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), it is provided by an NPC in Wyndon after the player obtains Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a laboratory-engineered item created by the Aether Foundation to stabilize the "Beast Killer" project (Type: Full, later renamed Silvally).
