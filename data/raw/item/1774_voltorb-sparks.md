## Identity & Utility
**Voltorb Sparks** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet).
* **Description:** A material dropped by members of the Voltorb evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific TMs. Unlike traditional items, it is not held or used directly in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting resource.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a specific component required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a Pokémon Center's TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While the sparks themselves have no competitive function in battle, they are essential for teaching competitive-grade moves (such as *Electric Terrain* or *Charge Beam*) to a team during the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource gathered from defeating or catching wild Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after battling wild **Voltorb** or **Electrode** (including Hisuian forms if present). It is automatically added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the classic sense, it is guaranteed or highly likely to drop from wild **Voltorb** and **Electrode** upon their defeat or capture in the Paldea region and other Gen IX locales. It is frequently farmed by players near industrial areas or ruins where these Pokémon congregate.
