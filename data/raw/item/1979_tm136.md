## Identity & Utility
**TM136** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** It is a single-use teaching tool (in Gen IX) used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Electric Terrain**. While the JSON lists a cost of 0, this indicates it cannot be purchased with standard currency at a Poké Mart; instead, it is acquired through exploration or the TM Machine crafting system.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; requires League Points (LP) and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Electric Terrain**. When used in battle, this move creates an electrified field for five turns. 
    * **Field Effects:** Grounded Pokémon cannot fall asleep or use Rest. Additionally, the power of Electric-type moves used by grounded Pokémon is increased by 30% (since Gen VIII).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Strategic Staple** in VGC and specialized Smogon tiers. Its primary competitive value lies in its synergy with **Quark Drive** (the Ability of "Future" Paradox Pokémon like Iron Valiant and Iron Hands), which activates automatically in Electric Terrain. It also serves as a hard counter to sleep-inducing strategies (e.g., Spore from Amoonguss).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Terrain Extender** held item (to increase duration to 8 turns) and the **Electric Seed** (which boosts Defense upon consumption in the terrain).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, the TM is primarily obtained via the **TM Machine**. Crafting TM136 requires:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Pincurchin Spines**
    * **3x Tadbulb Gel**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. Materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Pincurchin** and **Tadbulb/Bellibolt**, making these species the "farming source" for this machine's availability.
