## Identity & Utility
**Journal** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A notebook that keeps a day-to-day record of the player's adventure. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold. It functions as a narrative log, automatically summarizing recent significant events (such as Pokémon caught or Gym Leaders defeated) whenever the player resumes their save file.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the trainer’s prior significant activities. Upon loading a saved game in *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum*, the Journal automatically opens to show the player what they were doing during their last session.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be brought into battle or held by a Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is mechanically significant in the Gen IV speedrunning and RNG manipulation communities. Opening the Journal to a page that mentions a captured or defeated Pokémon advances the game's Random Number Generator (RNG) by 2, a technique used to manipulate wild encounters and IVs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Given to the player by their **Mother** in Twinleaf Town shortly after starting the journey and receiving a Pokédex. In *Pokémon Platinum*, it is obtained alongside the Parcel to be delivered to the rival, Barry.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is unique and is never held by wild Pokémon. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability.
