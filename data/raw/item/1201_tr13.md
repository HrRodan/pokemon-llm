## Identity & Utility
**TR13 (Focus Energy)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. This particular TR teaches **Focus Energy**, which allows the user to focus their mind to increase their critical-hit ratio. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, TRs are **consumable** and break after one use.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In the Galar region, they are more commonly traded for Watts (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Focus Energy** to a compatible Pokémon. Focus Energy increases the user's critical-hit ratio by **two stages**. This essentially moves the user from the base critical hit rate (~4.17%) to a 50% chance to crit (or 100% if combined with a high-crit move or a held item like Scope Lens).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling with this item provides no additional secondary effects and is generally a waste of the item.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. While Focus Energy is a powerful setup move—especially when paired with the **Sniper** ability (Drapion, Kingdra) or **Super Luck** (Togekiss)—the TR itself is a consumable resource. In the VGC or Smogon formats, the *move* is used for "Crit-fishing" builds that bypass an opponent's defensive stat boosts (Reflect, Light Screen, or Defense buffs), as critical hits ignore these modifiers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time teaching tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR13 is primarily obtained through **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (for 2,000 Watts, though inventory rotates daily) or as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** against Normal-type or Fighting-type Pokémon. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively a manufactured technological item or a reward for defeating powerful Dynamax entities.
* **World Knowledge:** TRs represent a return to the classic "disposable" nature of move-teaching items, contrasting with the infinite-use TMs of the same era. They usually contain higher-tier or more strategically complex moves than standard TMs.
