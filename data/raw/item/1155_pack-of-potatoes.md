## Identity & Utility
**Pack-of-potatoes** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A bulk pack of potatoes used specifically for the Pokémon Camp cooking mechanic. According to its culinary profile, potatoes are used to mellow out spicy flavors, resulting in a more mild dish. It is a **Consumable** ingredient that can be purchased from specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a key ingredient in the **Pokémon Camp** minigame to create various types of Curry (primarily the "Potato Curry" family). Cooking with this item restores a Pokémon's HP, PP, and increases Friendliness and Experience Points depending on the resulting Curry quality.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect in battle and its primary function exists outside of the combat engine.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Curry Dex** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Ingredient Sellers** found in the Galar region's Wild Area and in certain towns (like Hammerlocke or Wyndon). The stock of these NPCs rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held** by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through commerce or as a reward for interacting with other players' camps. Unlike many food items, it is not typically gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
