## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PEG8880)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair within the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, a specific Pokémon (determined by the crystal's ID) will appear in the den until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily distributed via external codes rather than in-game markets).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the West Lake Axewell area of the Wild Area), it beam-summons a Max Raid Battle. The effect lasts until the Pokémon is defeated or until midnight of the day it was used. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld designed to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon or the farming of Max Raid rewards (TRs, Exp. Candies, and Dynite Ore).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is the primary mechanic for encountering specific species that may otherwise be version-exclusive or rare (such as Larvitar or Jangmo-o in certain distributions).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts or through standard exploration. It was distributed as a **special promotional bonus**, typically via serial codes provided with the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack, or through retail partnerships (e.g., GameStop/EB Games).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to Mystery Gift distributions and external promotional events.
