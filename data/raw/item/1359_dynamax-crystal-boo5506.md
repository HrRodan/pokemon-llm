## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Boo5506)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use event-exclusive item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a internal cost value, it is effectively a promotional item distributed via serial codes or special events rather than a retail product.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the stone pillar of the Watchtower Lair, it summons a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. This allows players to encounter Pokémon that may otherwise be version-exclusive or rare (e.g., Larvitar or Jangmo-o, depending on the specific crystal code).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld/PvE. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for farming Pokémon with specific **Hidden Abilities (HA)**, high **Individual Values (IVs)**, or **Gigantamax** factors, which are guaranteed or more likely in these raids.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon the successful spawning of the Max Raid beacon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a **Promotional Item** via serial codes (often through retailers like Best Buy, GameStop, or as pre-order bonuses). It is not available through normal gameplay or Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, this crystal is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability or any in-game thieving mechanics (Thief/Covet).
* **Context:** The alphanumeric designation (Boo5506) identifies the specific raid encounter programmed into the crystal. These crystals were the primary method for Game Freak to host localized "Offline Raids" that didn't require an active internet connection once the item was claimed.
