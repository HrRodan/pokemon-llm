## Identity & Utility
**TM204 (Psychic Noise)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are consumable but can be crafted repeatedly at a TM Machine. TM204 teaches the move **Psychic Noise**, a sound-based Psychic-type attack.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through exploration or crafted using League Points and Pokémon materials).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Noise**. This move deals special damage (Power: 75) and prevents the target from recovering HP by any means—including moves (like Recover), Abilities (like Regeneration), or held items (like Leftovers)—for two turns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal impact; TMs are generally not used for Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Anti-Meta.** It is a staple in competitive VGC and Smogon singles for "stall-breaking." It is used to punish defensive walls and Pokémon reliant on recovery moves or *Leftovers*, effectively acting as a damaging version of *Heal Block*. Being sound-based, it also bypasses *Substitute*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **TM Machine** mechanic in Paldea and the Terarium, requiring materials such as **Hatenna Dust** and **Ralts Dust** to replicate.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy). Once the recipe is unlocked, it can be crafted at any TM Machine using **3,000 LP**, **3 Hatenna Dust**, and **3 Ralts Dust**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured human-made device. Use of the **Pickup** ability will not yield this specific TM.
