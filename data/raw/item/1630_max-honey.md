## Identity & Utility
**Max Honey** is a **Revival** item and special ingredient introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, high-potency nectar produced by Dynamax Vespiquen. It serves a dual purpose: it is a top-tier recovery consumable and a specialized culinary ingredient used to refine Max Soup. It is a **Consumable** item that is highly valuable.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive; reflects its status as a premium recovery item and rare drop).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a fainted Pokémon, it functions identically to a **Max Revive**, fully restoring the Pokémon to 100% HP and removing the fainted status.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; generally not used for Fling strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Only.** Like all revival items, Max Honey is banned in standard VGC and Smogon competitive formats. Its primary value lies in high-stakes playthroughs like Nuzlockes or for post-game progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Gigantamax Urshifu:** Max Honey is a critical "Key Ingredient" requirement. While most Pokémon require only Max Mushrooms to create Max Soup (granting the Gigantamax Factor), **Urshifu** specifically requires the addition of Max Honey to the recipe because it otherwise finds the taste of Max Mushrooms unpalatable.
    * **Vespiquen Connection:** Directly linked to the biological output of Dynamaxed Vespiquen.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically obtained within the **Isle of Armor** (Sword/Shield DLC). It is a guaranteed drop from defeating a Dynamax Vespiquen in a Max Raid Battle at Honeycalm Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on standard wild Pokémon. It is exclusively acquired through the scripted encounter with the "Queen of the Island" or repeatable Max Raid Battles at the Honeycalm Island den.
* **Lore Context:** Unlike standard Honey, which merely attracts wild Pokémon, Max Honey is infused with Dynamax energy, giving it the restorative power to bring a Pokémon back from fainting instantly.
