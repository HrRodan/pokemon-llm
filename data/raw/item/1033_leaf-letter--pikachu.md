## Identity & Utility
**Leaf Letter (Pikachu)** is a **Loot/Gift item** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A letter written on a natural leaf, featuring a message composed using Pikachu’s footprints. It is a **Consumable/Sentimental** item that **Cannot** be bought or sold for profit. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This signifies its status as a special commemorative gift rather than a commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Leaf Letter has **no functional gameplay effect** or mechanical utility in battle or the overworld. It serves entirely as a "Partner Gift," a token of friendship from the player's Partner Pikachu.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional status effects if flung; however, the move Fling is not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a flavor item exclusive to the *Let's Go* series, intended for immersion and roleplay rather than tactical advantage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the high-friendship interaction mechanic between the player and their Partner Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained exclusively as a gift from the **Partner Pikachu** in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!*. It is found periodically when the player interacts with their partner after it finds a "present" in the field.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is unique to the **Partner Pokémon mechanic** and cannot be farmed or found via the Pickup ability in standard gameplay. It represents the deepening bond between a Trainer and their starter.
