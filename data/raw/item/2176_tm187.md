## Identity & Utility
**TM187 (Icicle Spear)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
*   **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Icicle Spear**. It is a single-use consumable in Generation IX that can be crafted at a TM Machine. Unlike TMs in older generations, it cannot be purchased directly from a Poké Mart.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In the Paldea region, it is acquired via the TM Machine using **3,000 LP**, **3 Shellder Pearls**, and **3 Frigibax Scales**.

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Icicle Spear** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    *   **Move Details:** Icicle Spear is a Physical Ice-type move with a base power of 25 and 100% accuracy. It is a multi-strike move that hits the target 2 to 5 times in a single turn.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** TMs in Generation IX generally cannot be held or used with Fling.
    *   **Competitive Use:** This TM is high-value for physical attackers, particularly those with the **Skill Link** ability (like Cloyster) to guarantee 5 hits, or those holding the **Loaded Dice** item (like Baxcalibur) to ensure at least 4-5 hits. It is a vital tool for breaking through **Focus Sashes**, the **Sturdy** ability, and **Substitutes**.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use to teach the move.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Specifically available in **Pokémon Scarlet & Violet** and its expansions (**The Teal Mask**, **The Indigo Disk**). The recipe is typically unlocked after defeating a specific Team Star boss or finding the TM in the overworld (notably in snowy regions like Glaseado Mountain).
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it must be gathered from wild **Shellder** and **Frigibax**. Materials are often gathered through manual battling or the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature.
