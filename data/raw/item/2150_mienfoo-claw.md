## Identity & Utility
**Mienfoo Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Mienfoo evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Value for LP exchange**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. It serves as a required component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs), typically those associated with Fighting-type moves (such as **TM112 Aura Sphere** or **TM158 Focus Blast**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for team preparation rather than active combat. Its value is strictly in granting access to powerful moves for a competitive moveset.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the "Material Drop" mechanic introduced in the Paldea region and its surrounding areas (Kitakami/Blueberry Academy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in shops. It is acquired as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild Mienfoo or Mienshao in the field.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "Held Item," it is dropped by wild **Mienfoo** and **Mienshao**. It is efficiently gathered by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature or by hunting these Pokémon in the Kitakami region or the Terarium.
