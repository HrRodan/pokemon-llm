## Identity & Utility
**Poisonium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola Region).
* **Description:** A crystallized manifestation of Z-Power used to augment elemental energy. When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Poison-type move, it grants access to powerful Z-Move technology. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **not for sale** and cannot be consumed or lost in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it upgrades the user's Poison-type moves into Z-Moves. 
    * **Damaging Moves:** Converts the move into **Acid Downpour**, a high-damage attack whose power scales based on the base move.
    * **Status Moves:** Converts the move into a **Z-Status move**, adding secondary effects (e.g., Z-Toxic raises Defense, Z-Poison Gas raises Evasion).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Item Protection:** Pokémon holding a Z-Crystal are immune to the effects of **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Trick**, and **Embargo**, and their item cannot be removed by the ability **Magician**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A niche but effective tool in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017-2019/Smogon). It is often used by Poison-type attackers like **Nihilego**, **Gengar**, or **Salazzle** to bypass defensive checks or secure a one-hit knockout (OHKO) on bulky Fairy or Grass-type opponents.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not required for evolution and does not trigger any specific biological changes. It specifically interacts with the **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** held by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained as a reward for progressing through the Island Challenge. It is typically found in the **Shady House** in Po Town after defeating Team Skull members or as a gift from Plumeria.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, non-consumable item that remains in the player's Bag or held by a designated party member. It cannot be traded if held by a Pokémon.
