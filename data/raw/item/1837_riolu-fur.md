## Identity & Utility
**Riolu Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized crafting component dropped by members of the Riolu evolutionary line. As a material found in the Paldea region, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for League Points (LP) or utilized at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 160 Poké Dollars/LP (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) located at Pokémon Centers. 
    * **Specific Recipes:** It is notably required for crafting moves consistent with Riolu’s combat style, such as **TM039 (Low Sweep)**, **TM058 (Brick Break)**, and **TM134 (Reversal)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Direct).** Its utility is strictly restricted to the preparation phase of competitive play, allowing trainers to teach essential Fighting-type coverage moves to their roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it contains Riolu's DNA, it does not trigger evolution (which requires high friendship during the day). It is solely a resource for the TM crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching a wild **Riolu**. It is a common drop for trainers exploring mountainous or rocky regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is added directly to the player's inventory upon the successful conclusion of a battle (Auto-drop mechanic).
* **Context:** In the ecology of the Paldea region, these materials represent the "sheddings" or remnants of Pokémon interactions. Trainers often farm this material in areas like **South Province (Area Four)** or **North Province (Area One)** to mass-produce powerful physical attacking TMs.
