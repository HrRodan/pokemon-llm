## Identity & Utility
**Zygarde Cube** is a **Key Item** (Gameplay category) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized vessel designed to collect and store Zygarde Cores and Cells scattered throughout the world. It serves as the primary interface for modifying the legendary Pokémon Zygarde, allowing for form changes and move tutoring. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Cube functions as a multi-tool for Zygarde's biology. 
    * **Form Modification:** It allows Zygarde to transition between its **10% Forme** (hound-like) and its **50% Forme** (serpent-like).
    * **Ability Management:** It can be used to grant Zygarde the **Power Construct** ability, enabling it to transform into its **Complete Forme** during battle when its HP falls below half.
    * **Move Tutor:** The Cube can teach Zygarde its signature moves that are not learned through traditional leveling: *Thousand Arrows*, *Thousand Waves*, *Core Enforcer*, *Extreme Speed*, and *Dragon Dance*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** While the item itself isn't held, it is mandatory for a Zygarde to be competitively viable. *Thousand Arrows* is considered one of the strongest moves in the game (ground-type move that hits Flying-types and Levitate users), and access to *Dragon Dance* via the Cube is critical for Zygarde's "Shed-Zygarde" or "Power Construct" sets in Ubers and VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with Zygarde. In Gen VII, it tracked the collection of 100 Cells; in Gen VIII onwards, it functions as a simplified form-change and move-teaching menu.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sun/Moon/USUM:** Obtained from Dexio and Sina at Route 16 (Alola) after a battle.
    * **Sword/Shield:** Obtained from the bargain merchant in Stow-on-Side if the player has a Zygarde in their party or PC.
    * **Scarlet/Violet:** Obtained via the Porto Marinada auction house if Zygarde is present in the player's collection.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind item linked to the ecosystem of the "Order Pokémon."
* **Context:** Lore-wise, the Cube was developed by the Aether Foundation or researchers like Sina and Dexio to help monitor and maintain the balance of the ecosystem by reassembling Zygarde's fragmented consciousness.
