## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PEG8650)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair within the Galar Wild Area. Once consumed, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; this is a nominal internal value. It is exclusively acquired via external distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty Raid Den in the Watchtower Ruins), it forces a Max Raid Battle to spawn. This specific crystal (PEG8650) is coded to trigger an encounter with **Stonjourner**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate a wild encounter and has no application in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. It is, however, highly valued by collectors and "Nuzlocke" players for securing a guaranteed encounter with a version-exclusive Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts strictly with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed as a promotional **Mystery Gift** code. Specifically, PEG8650 was associated with retail pre-order bonuses or special event distributions (such as those from GameStop, EB Games, or specialized Japanese retail flyers) to allow players to face Stonjourner regardless of their game version.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a "Special Acquisition" item tied to the game's external promotional cycle.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are rare fragments tied to the Dynamax phenomenon. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces which attract random Pokémon to active dens, these specific crystals act as "beacons" for specific species, momentarily warping the local Max Raid environment to manifest a specific Pokémon.
