## Identity & Utility
**Munchlax Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by the Munchlax evolutionary line. It is a consumable resource used exclusively at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers to create Technical Machines. It cannot be used in battle, held by a Pokémon for an effect, or used as a medicine.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Insignificant). In the game's economy, it is more frequently converted into **League Points (LP)** or used as a reagent rather than bought or sold for currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory component in the recipes for specific TMs. Specifically, it is required to craft moves that align with Munchlax and Snorlax's physical prowess and themes, such as:
    * **TM066 (Body Slam)**
    * **TM084 (Stomping Tantrum)**
    * **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the item itself has no competitive utility, it is essential for teaching high-tier competitive moves like *Body Slam* or *Stomping Tantrum* to various physical attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting material within the Paldean and Kitakami ecosystems.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop by defeating or catching wild **Munchlax** or **Snorlax**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; it is a **guaranteed drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Munchlax line.
* **Context:** In the wild, Munchlax Fangs are most easily farmed in the **Timeless Woods** (Kitakami) or during Mass Outbreaks. These materials represent the "loot-based" progression system introduced in the ninth generation to incentivize exploring the overworld and engaging with wild Pokémon.
