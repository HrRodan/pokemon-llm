## Identity & Utility
**Mega Bracelet** is a **Key Item** (categorized as "gameplay") introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This specialized cuff serves as the conduit for Mega Evolution. It reacts with a Pokémon's held Mega Stone to unlock a temporary, powerful transformation in battle. As a **Key Item**, it is **not consumable** and **cannot be bought or sold**; it is a permanent addition to the player's Bag.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the Trainer the ability to trigger **Mega Evolution** during a battle. For the transformation to occur, the Pokémon must be holding its species-specific Mega Stone, and the Trainer must possess this bracelet.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Fundamental Mechanic.** While the bracelet itself doesn't take up a Pokémon's item slot, it is the mechanical requirement for Mega Evolution—one of the most dominant competitive archetypes in Generation VI and VII. It allows for massive stat boosts, ability changes, and type shifts that define the meta-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Facilitates a temporary "Battle Evolution." Unlike Evolution Stones, this does not permanently change the Pokémon's form. It has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it resides in the Trainer's Key Items pocket rather than on a Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained via story progression. In the Alola region (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), it is gifted to the player by Dexio and Sina (the assistants of Professor Sycamore) after the player has demonstrated their strength (typically after becoming the Champion in SM or during the post-game/Pony Island events in USUM).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological/mystical artifact given only to recognized Trainers.
