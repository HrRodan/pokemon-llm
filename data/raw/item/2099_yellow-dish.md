## Identity & Utility
**Yellow-Dish** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item serves as a cosmetic customization option for the player's picnic set. It allows the player to change the appearance of the dishes used during the picnic and sandwich-making minigames. It is a **reusable cosmetic item** that provides no direct gameplay advantages or stat boosts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Typically designated as **Not for sale** or acquired via specific NPC interactions/shops like Picnic-Knacks in the Paldea region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, they can select the Yellow-Dish from their collection to change the visual theme of their table setting. This is purely aesthetic and does not affect the "Meal Powers" generated by sandwiches.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a flavor/lifestyle item used exclusively in the overworld picnic mechanic. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution and has no interaction with Pokémon abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, picnic components like the Yellow-Dish are typically obtained from **Picnic-Knacks** specialty shops located in major hubs such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a key piece of adventuring gear rather than a biological or held resource.
* **Context:** The addition of the Yellow-Dish is part of the broader customization system in Generation IX, allowing players to express their personal style through their camping equipment while breeding Pokémon or increasing Friendship levels.
