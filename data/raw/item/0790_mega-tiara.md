## Identity & Utility
**Mega-Tiara** is an **Unused Key Item** categorized under "Unused," technically introduced to the game data in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** It is a decorative headpiece containing a **Key Stone**, the essential catalyst for Mega Evolution. While it possesses the flavor text of a functional item, it is coded specifically as an NPC-exclusive asset. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In terms of lore and NPC mechanics, the Mega Tiara allows a Trainer to trigger **Mega Evolution** for a Pokémon holding its respective Mega Stone. However, as an item in the game's code, it has no functional effect for the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is unobtainable through normal gameplay and cannot be used in Smogon, VGC, or standard online play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is conceptually linked to the **Mega Evolution** mechanic, specifically tied to **Lisia** and her partner Pokémon, Altaria (Ali), which Mega Evolves into Mega Altaria.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** This item is part of the game’s "unused" index. In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire* (ORAS), it serves as the signature Key Stone accessory for the Contest Star **Lisia**. Although the data identifies it with Generation VII (Alola), its primary association is with the Hoenn region's contest circuit.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It exists purely as a character-specific cosmetic/story asset within the game's internal database.
