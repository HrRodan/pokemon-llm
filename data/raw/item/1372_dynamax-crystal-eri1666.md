## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ERI1666** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, single-use consumable that reacts with the power of the Galar region's Power Spots. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. This specific crystal (ERI1666) is tied to promotional distributions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this is a nominal value for a promotional item distributed via Serial Code).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area), it causes a **Gigantamax Corviknight** to appear for a Max Raid Battle. The encounter is guaranteed regardless of the current weather or standard den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Collection.** While the item itself has no competitive battle utility, it was a primary method for players to obtain a Corviknight with the **Gigantamax Factor** and its Hidden Ability outside of rare natural den spawns, facilitating the acquisition of competitive G-Max Corviknight for the VGC (Video Game Championships) Series 4 and beyond.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a consumable event-trigger item that disappears from the inventory upon successful activation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** during promotional events (notably through retail partnerships like GameStop, Target, or Amazon pre-order bonuses). It is not obtainable through normal gameplay or in-game Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. These crystals are considered "Manufactured" or "Ancient artifacts" of the Dynamax phenomenon, rather than biological drops. 
* **Location Logic:** The item only functions at the **Watchtower Lair**, located in the Watchtower Ruins section of the Galar Wild Area. Using it elsewhere is prohibited.
