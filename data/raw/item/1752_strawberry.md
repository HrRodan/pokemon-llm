## Identity & Utility
**Strawberry** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A fresh, sweet fruit used exclusively as a component in the Picnic mechanic. It is a **Consumable** item used to craft sandwiches that provide various "Meal Powers" to the player. Unlike traditional berries, it cannot be held by a Pokémon or used directly in battle.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich recipe, it contributes to the final Meal Powers. It primarily adds **Sweet** and **Sour** flavor profiles. It is a common ingredient in recipes designed to increase **Egg Power**, **Catching Power**, or **Encounter Power** (specifically for Psychic or Ghost types depending on the combination).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be brought into a battle. Its value lies entirely in the **breeding (Egg Power)** and **shiny hunting** meta-games.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component for the Sandwich system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in the Paldea region. It can be purchased at specialized grocery retailers, specifically **Sure Cans**, **Deli Cioso**, and certain **Aguila Grocery** locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which can be farmed via Pickup or wild encounters, Strawberries must be purchased from vendors or found as sparkling pickups on the ground in specific Paldean biomes.
