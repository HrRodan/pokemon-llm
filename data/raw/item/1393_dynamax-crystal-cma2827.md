## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CMA2827)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used specifically at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. It acts as a beacon to summon a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; the nominal cost is a data placeholder as these are distributed via Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty Raid Den in the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (identified as Gigantamax Sandaconda for this specific serial code). The raid remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** While the item itself has no competitive utility, the Pokémon captured through the resulting Raid often possesses Hidden Abilities or the Gigantamax Factor, making it a source for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts strictly with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was made available exclusively via **Serial Code distributions** (often through retail partnerships like GameStop or Micromania). It is not available for purchase at Poké Marts or found through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**; it is granted directly to the player’s "Other Items" pocket via Mystery Gift.
