## Identity & Utility
**Courage Candy XL** is a **Vitamin** consumable introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy packed with energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used to permanently boost a Pokémon's stats. Unlike traditional vitamins (like Zinc), this item is level-locked and specifically targets high-level team members.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the monetary value is low, its utility is gated by the Pokémon's level.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the **Special Defense (Sp. Def)** Awakening Values (AVs) of a single Pokémon. It is the highest tier of the Courage Candy family (Standard < L < XL).
* **Usage Constraint:** This item can only be administered to Pokémon that are **Level 60 or higher**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic is not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is vital for "Candy-entry" competitive formats within the *Let's Go* ecosystem to maximize bulk. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as the "Awakening Value" system (AVs) was replaced by the return of Effort Values (EVs) in later generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the unique LGPE growth mechanic where candies are used in place of traditional EV training.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (LGPE) by transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak, catching high-level Pokémon, or as rewards from the Poké Ball Plus.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Instead, it is typically "farmed" through the **Catch Combo** mechanic; catching many Pokémon of the same species in a row increases the likelihood of receiving XL-sized candies as a reward.
* **System Context:** Represents the "End-game" tier of stat-boosting for defensive optimization. While "Courage Candy" boosts Sp. Def, its counterparts (Health, Mighty, Tough, Smart, Quick) handle the other five core stats.
