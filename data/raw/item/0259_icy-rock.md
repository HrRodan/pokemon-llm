## Identity & Utility
**Icy Rock** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An elemental catalyst that sustains frozen atmospheric conditions. It is a **Holdable** item that is **holdable-active**, meaning its effect triggers automatically when the holder initiates weather. It is part of the four-member "weather rock" cycle (alongside Heat, Damp, and Smooth rocks).
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Mid-range).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that uses the move **Hail** (or sets it via the **Snow Warning** ability), the duration of the weather is extended from 5 turns to **8 turns**. 
    * *Mechanical Nuance:* The extension is tied to the move/ability activation. If the holder switches out or the item is removed (e.g., via Knock Off) *after* the weather has been set, the duration remains 8 turns.
    * *World Knowledge (Gen IX):* In Generation IX, Hail was replaced by **Snow**. The Icy Rock now extends the duration of Snow (Snowscape/Snow Warning) to 8 turns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 40 (Standard physical damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Archetype Essential.** It is a staple for "Hail" (now "Snow") teams in Smogon and VGC formats. It is vital for maximizing the uptime of the **Slush Rush** speed boost and ensuring the move **Blizzard** remains 100% accurate for as long as possible. In modern Snow mechanics, it also helps maintain the 1.5x Defense buff for Ice-types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is categorized as an "underground" item, meaning it interacts with mining mechanics in regions like Sinnoh.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sinnoh/Hisui:** Frequently found by mining in the **Sinnoh Underground** or the Grand Underground. 
    * **General:** Often available for purchase at specialized BP (Battle Point) shops or regional boutiques like **Delibird Presents** in Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** found on wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through exploration, the **Underground** mining minigame, or as a reward for high-level **Pickup** (levels 71–100 in certain generations).
