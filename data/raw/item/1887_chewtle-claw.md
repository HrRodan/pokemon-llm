## Identity & Utility
**Chewtle Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A physical specimen dropped by members of the Chewtle evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or, more importantly, exchanged at the TM Machine. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for competitive benefit.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common Material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is used in the recipes for various Water and Ground-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the "TM Machine" crafting economy in *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*. It has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Technical Machine crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Chewtle family.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item in the traditional sense; instead, it is automatically added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon a successful encounter with wild **Chewtle** or **Drednaw**. These Pokémon are commonly found near riverbanks, wetlands, and lakes throughout the Paldea region.
