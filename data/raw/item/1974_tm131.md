## Identity & Utility
**TM131 (Pollen Puff)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that grants a Pokémon the move **Pollen Puff**. As a modern TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked. It is categorized under "All Machines."
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **10,000 LP** and specific materials to craft at a TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Pollen Puff**, a Bug-type Special move with 90 Power and 100% Accuracy. 
* **Move Logic:**
    * **Targeting Opponents:** Deals standard Special damage.
    * **Targeting Allies:** In Double Battles, if the move is used on a teammate, it instead **restores 50% of that ally's maximum HP**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal impact; TMs are not designed for Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/VGC Staple.** Pollen Puff is one of the most powerful support moves in the competitive Doubles format. Its ability to provide burst healing to a partner while maintaining offensive pressure makes it mandatory on many top-tier Pokémon like Amoonguss, Ribombee, and Ogerpon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a vital tool for Specially-inclined Bug-types and various "flower-themed" Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore

    * **10,000 LP**
    * **5x Cutiefly Process**
    * **3x Petilil Leaf**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured human utility for Pokémon training.
