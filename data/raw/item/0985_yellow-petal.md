## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Petal** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in internal indices) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A pressed flower petal received from Sophocles during Mina’s Trial in the Poni Island trial sequence. It is a **Quest Item** that serves as a proof of progress. It **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Yellow Petal has no direct mechanical effect in battle or on a Pokémon's stats. Its sole purpose is to be collected alongside six other colored petals (Red, Orange, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Pink) to fulfill the requirements of Mina’s Trial. Once all seven are gathered, they are used to craft the **Rainbow Flower**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-essential item used exclusively during the main narrative of *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a component of a specific Alolan Trial mechanic. It cannot be intercepted by moves like Thief or affected by abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically obtained in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. After defeating Captain Sophocles at the Hokulani Observatory during Mina’s Trial, he awards the player this petal. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique scripted event item gifted by a Trial Captain. 
* **Context:** In the lore of the Alola region, Mina’s Trial involves a "pilgrimage" across the islands to meet various captains, symbolizing the bond between the islands and the trial-goer. The Yellow Petal represents the connection to the trial site at Mount Hokulani.
