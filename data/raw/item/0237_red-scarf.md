## Identity & Utility
**Red Scarf** is a **Scarf (Contest Item)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon to enhance its performance in the niche world of Pokémon Contests. It is a **Held Item** that specifically boosts the "Cool" condition. While it has a nominal cost, it is historically treated as a reward for excellence rather than a common store-bought item.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Special acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pokémon entering a Contest or Super Contest, it increases the Pokémon's **Coolness** stat during the Visual Competition (the introductory round). This allows the Pokémon to earn more hearts/points from the judges or audience before moves are even performed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no mechanical function in standard Trainer battles, VGC, or Smogon formats. It is exclusively used for the Contest side-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a five-item set (Red, Blue, Pink, Green, and Yellow Scarves), each corresponding to a specific Contest condition (Cool, Beauty, Cute, Clever, and Tough).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions, the Red Scarf is typically obtained from the **Pokémon Fan Club Chairman** (located in Slateport City or Hearthome City). The player must show him a Pokémon that has already reached a high or maximum "Cool" stat—usually achieved by feeding it Spicy Pokéblocks or Spicy Poffins. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It is a specialty reward given to trainers who have demonstrated mastery over the "Cool" category of Pokémon grooming and training.
