## Identity & Utility
**Varoom Fume** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A material dropped by the Varoom evolutionary line after battle. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** used primarily at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers in the Paldea region. It cannot be used directly on a Pokémon or held in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount, its primary value lies in its use as a currency/ingredient for move teaching.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific **Technical Machines (TMs)**. In the Gen IX crafting system, players combine League Points (LP) with specific Pokémon drops like Varoom Fume to "print" TMs for teaching moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility/progression item for the overworld and team building; it has no direct impact on competitive battle statistics or strategy outside of move acquisition.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a thematic drop from the **Varoom** and **Revavroom** lines. It is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Varoom** or **Revavroom**. It is also a common reward from **Tera Raid Battles** featuring these Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; it is a **guaranteed drop** upon victory in the Paldea region. Players often farm this material by using the "Let's Go!" Auto-Battle feature in areas where Varoom are plentiful, such as the East Province (Area Three) or near the Team Star Poison Crew base.
