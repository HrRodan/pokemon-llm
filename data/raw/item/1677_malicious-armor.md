## Identity & Utility
**Malicious Armor** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar set of armor infused with a lingering grudge. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that serves as the catalyst for a specific branched evolution. While it has an internal cost value, it is primarily obtained through unique NPC trades rather than standard Poké Mart shelves.
* **Cost:** 750 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though typically acquired through material exchange).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a **Charcadet**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Ceruledge** (a Fire/Ghost-type Pokémon).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard for most evolution-related items).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. However, it is essential for obtaining **Ceruledge**, a prominent offensive threat in VGC and Smogon formats known for its signature move *Bitter Blade* and the *Weak Armor* or *Flash Fire* abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is a **Version Exclusive** counterpart to the *Auspicious Armor*. It represents the "malice" required to forge Ceruledge’s blades, contrasting with the "auspicious" nature of Armarouge.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Violet*, the item is obtained in **Zapapico** by trading **10 Sinistea Chips** to an NPC. In *Pokémon Scarlet*, players must usually obtain it via trading with a *Violet* player, as the NPC in *Scarlet* provides the Auspicious Armor instead.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be crafted or traded for using materials (Sinistea Chips) dropped by wild **Sinistea** (often farmed using "Let's Go" auto-battles in the Paldea region).
