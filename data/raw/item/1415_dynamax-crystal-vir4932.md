## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (VIR4932)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the internal data lists a price, these items are functionally priceless as they are typically distributed via serial codes or promotional events and cannot be purchased at in-game Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins) causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the player defeats the Pokémon or until the in-game clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Acquisition Only).** The item itself has no battle utility; however, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing guaranteed access to specific Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or the Gigantamax Factor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively through real-world promotional events (such as retail distributions at Best Buy, GameStop, or via CoroCoro magazine). Once the serial code is redeemed, the item is added to the "Other Items" pocket of the Bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an event-exclusive item and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or other in-game methods.
* **Lore context:** The "VIR" designation typically refers to a specific distribution index; these crystals allow trainers to bypass the random nature of Max Raid Dens to secure a specific, often rare, encounter.
