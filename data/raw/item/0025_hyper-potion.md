## Identity & Utility
**Hyper Potion** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in Generation I (referenced here in its Generation III Hoenn context). 
* **Description:** A high-potency spray-type medicine designed for treating significant wounds. It is a consumable item that can be used both during battle to sustain a Pokémon’s momentum and in the overworld for post-combat recovery. It sits in the third tier of the standard healing hierarchy (Potion < Super Potion < **Hyper Potion** < Max Potion).
* **Cost:** 1,500 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Expense**). Its price reflects its mid-to-late game utility where standard Potions become mathematically obsolete.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores exactly **200 HP** to a single Pokémon. (Note: In later generations beyond the provided data, this effect was adjusted to 120 HP, but it remains a "High-Tier" healing solution).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough & Nuzlocke Essential.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), direct healing medicines are prohibited. However, in Nuzlocke challenges, the Hyper Potion is a critical resource for keeping high-HP tanks (like Snorlax or Blissey) alive when a Super Potion's 50 HP recovery is insufficient.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "countable" and "holdable" item, though holding it in battle provides no passive benefit; it must be manually administered by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in all regions once a Trainer has earned a specific number of Gym Badges (typically 4–6 badges depending on the region). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon** (0% encounter rate in the provided data). It is primarily sourced through retail purchase or found as field items (hidden or visible Poké Balls) throughout the world.
* **Economic Strategy:** At 1,500 Poké Dollars, it is more cost-effective for high-HP targets than buying multiple Super Potions, though it requires a larger upfront investment. It is often gathered by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability once they reach higher level tiers.
