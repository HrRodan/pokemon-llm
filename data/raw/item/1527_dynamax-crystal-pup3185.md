## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PUP3185** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot** be bought through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While the internal metadata assigns a trivial cost, these items were primarily distributed via serial codes from retailers (such as GameStop or GAME) or as pre-order bonuses.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is generated. This initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. 
    * **Specific Encounter:** In the case of **PUP3185**, this crystal is programmed to summon **Stonjourner**. This allowed players to encounter the Pokémon regardless of their game version's standard encounter tables.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for collection and Pokédex completion. The Pokémon caught via this crystal may have fixed or high Individual Values (IVs) and a chance for its Hidden Ability, which can then be used in competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the Raid. If the player loses the battle, the beam remains active until the end of the day, allowing for multiple attempts.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts. It was distributed as a **Promotional Event Item**. Specifically, PUP3185 was often bundled with retailers to promote version-exclusive encounters or special events in the Galar region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It exists strictly as a digital distribution item to facilitate "Max Raid Battle" events at the Watchtower Lair.
