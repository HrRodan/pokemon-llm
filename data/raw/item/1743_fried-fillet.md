## Identity & Utility
**Fried Fillet** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A culinary component used exclusively in the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a **Consumable** ingredient that can be purchased from specific food vendors. As a sandwich topping, it contributes to the player's ability to manipulate wild Pokémon spawns and rewards.
* **Cost:** 360 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during the sandwich-making minigame at a Picnic, the Fried Fillet provides specific boosts to **Meal Powers**. It primarily adds to the **Salty** and **Savory** flavor profiles. Depending on the combination of other ingredients, it helps trigger powers such as *Catching Power*, *Encounter Power*, or *Raid Power*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. It has no direct utility in Smogon or VGC battles. Its value lies entirely in the "preparation" meta-game—helping players find, catch, or train Pokémon more efficiently through Meal Powers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its only interaction is with the Gen IX **Sandwich/Picnic system**. It is a core component of the "Fried Fillet Sandwich" series of recipes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** outlets and the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. It becomes available to the player early in the journey through the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike traditional RPG items found in the overworld or held by creatures, this is a commercial food product found exclusively in retail shops or as a random reward from NPCs at picnic sites.
