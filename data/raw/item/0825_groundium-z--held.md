## Identity & Utility
**Groundium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically tuned to Ground-type energy. It is a **Held Item** that cannot be bought or sold (Cost: 0). Unlike standard items, it is a specialized tool that enables the use of "ultimate" moves and is central to the Gen VII battle gimmick.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with at least one **Ground-type move**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the Z-Move **Tectonic Rage**. 
    * If the base move is an attacking move, Tectonic Rage deals massive damage based on the original move's power.
    * If the base move is a status move (e.g., Sand Attack), it transforms into **Z-Sand Attack**, granting the user an Accuracy boost in addition to the move's normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move **Fling**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in the Generation VII meta (VGC 2017-2019 and Smogon SM). It is frequently used by physical attackers like **Landorus-Therian**, **Garchomp**, and **Excadrill** to bypass defensive checks (like Toxapex or Aegislash) with a one-time high-damage nuke.
    * **Item Protection:** Z-Crystals have unique properties; they cannot be removed by **Knock Off**, stolen via **Thief/Covet**, or swapped using **Trick/Switcheroo**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for offensive or tactical utility in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the Groundium Z is obtained by the player upon completing the **Grand Trial of Poni Island**, gifted by the Kahuna **Hapu**. It is a unique item and cannot be mass-produced.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally granted as a mark of a trainer's success in the Island Challenge. Because it is a Z-Crystal, it is ignored by the **Pickup** ability.
