## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR7121** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event-based consumable used in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the **Watchtower Lair**, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay; it is typically acquired through serial code distributions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a technical cost in the game data, it is not available for purchase in Marts and is considered a high-value promotional item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player is at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), using this item triggers a **Max Raid Battle** with a specific Pokémon (encoded in the internal variable). The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Source-based.** The item itself has no utility in battle. However, it is used to encounter Pokémon that may possess Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), or the Gigantamax factor, making it a tool for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not trigger evolution but provides access to a specific encounter that might otherwise be unavailable or rare via standard Den rotations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** during special retail promotions or events (e.g., Pokémon Center distributions or movie tie-ins). It is intended as a one-time use item to grant the player a guaranteed encounter with a rare Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-managed resource.
