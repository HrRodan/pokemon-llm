## Identity & Utility
**Sharp Beak** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A long, pointed beak designed to be held by a Pokémon to sharpen its aerial offensive capabilities. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is active during battle to provide a persistent power boost to specific move types. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**, though typically obtained through exploration or farming rather than mass-purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the power of the holder’s **Flying-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no additional secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **Niche Competitive Item**. It is often used on Flying-type "Glass Cannons" (like Talonflame or Dodrio) that want to maximize the damage of moves like *Brave Bird* or *Dual Wingbeat* without the recoil damage of a Life Orb or the move-locking restriction of Choice items. It is especially useful in "Draft League" formats or Nuzlocke challenges where survivability is prioritized alongside damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It functions independently of the holder's ability unless the holder has **Klutz** (which negates the boost) or **Unburden** (which activates if the item is consumed/lost).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in mountainous regions or near avian nesting grounds in the overworld. In most games, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and must be found or taken from wild Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is frequently carried by avian Pokémon species. It can be farmed from wild **Spearow, Fearow, Doduo, Dodrio,** and **Skarmory**. Using moves like **Thief, Covet,** or the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets are the primary methods for acquisition.
