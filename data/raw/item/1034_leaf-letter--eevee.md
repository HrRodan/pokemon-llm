## Identity & Utility
**Leaf Letter (Eevee)** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A sentimental flavor item representing a letter written on a leaf, featuring the footprints of the player's partner Eevee. It is a **Consumable/Flavor** item that **Cannot** be bought or used for any mechanical purpose in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; Unique acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item has no functional effect in battle or the overworld. It serves as a "Gift" from the player's Partner Pokémon, acting as a collectible that tracks the bond between the Trainer and their Eevee.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the single-player experience and flavor within the *Let's Go* series. It cannot be held by Pokémon in traditional competitive formats (Smogon/VGC) as it originated in a game without held items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several possible gifts the **Partner Eevee** can present to the player when their friendship is high.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*. It is obtained as a gift from the **Partner Eevee**. When the partner Pokémon wants to give the player a present (indicated by an icon on the Eevee Play screen), there is a chance it will be this specific Leaf Letter.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively generated by the **Partner Pokémon** mechanic. It is often kept by players as a memento rather than sold to shops (though it has a sell value of 0 or minimal in some contexts, it is essentially "priceless" flavor text).
