## Identity & Utility
**Academy Ball** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** Despite its name, this is not a device for catching Pokémon, but rather a recreational sports ball used during the **Picnic** mechanic. It is themed after the Naranja Academy (Scarlet) or Uva Academy (Violet). It is a **Non-Consumable Utility Item** that cannot be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; provided as a default tool for the player's picnic kit).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a Picnic, the Academy Ball can be interacted with (kicked or thrown). Pokémon in the current party will chase, nudge, and play with the ball. This serves as a social interaction tool to increase the **Friendship (Affection)** levels of the party Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item resides in the "Picnic Item" pocket and cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be brought into a battle instance. Its utility is restricted entirely to the overworld/camp mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution directly, the Friendship gained from playing with the ball can help satisfy the requirements for Friendship-based evolutions (e.g., Eevee into Sylveon/Espeon/Umbreon or Riolu into Lucario).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically available to the player once the **Picnic** feature is unlocked early in *Pokémon Scarlet* and *Pokémon Violet*. It is part of the standard curriculum equipment for students of the Paldean Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique key-utility item tied to the player character's status as a student. Unlike the "Soothe Bell," which provides a passive friendship buff, the Academy Ball requires active player participation to generate value.
