## Identity & Utility
**X-Accuracy 2** is a **Miracle-Shooter (Wonder Launcher)** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized, battle-only consumable designed to sharply improve a Pokémon's precision. Unlike standard battle items, it is exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic—a high-tech battle sub-system used primarily in multiplayer. It cannot be used outside of this specific context or held by a Pokémon in a standard manner.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is "purchased" during battle using points accumulated over time within the Wonder Launcher interface.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon during battle, it **raises the target’s Accuracy by two stages** (Sharply Raises). This significantly reduces the chance of high-powered, low-accuracy moves (like Hydro Pump or Fire Blast) missing their target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Legacy.** This item was exclusive to the "Wonder Launcher" battle format in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. Because standard competitive formats (VGC and Smogon) typically disable the Wonder Launcher, this item saw no use in professional play. It is considered a legacy mechanic and has not appeared in any games following Generation V.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions similarly to a standard X Accuracy but provides a double stat boost (+2 instead of the +1 provided by the standard item in Gen V). The effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Only accessible within battles where the **Wonder Launcher** setting is enabled. Players must wait for their point gauge to fill during the match to "buy" and use the item instantly.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item does not exist in the overworld or the player's standard bag; it is strictly a digital construct of the Unova region's advanced battle simulators. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
