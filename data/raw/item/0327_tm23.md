## Identity & Utility
**TM23 (Technical Machine 23)** is a Technical Machine introduced in **Generation I** (with this specific metadata entry originating from **Generation III**).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. As a TM, its contents are historically variable; while this specific record identifies it with **Iron Tail**, it has transitioned to teach **Smack Down** (Gen V-VII) and **Thief** (Gen VIII) in later installments. It is a **Consumable** item (in Generations I–IV and IX) or an **Infinite-use** item (Generations V–VIII).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-to-High Range/Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a compatible Pokémon a specific move. Depending on the game version:
    * **Iron Tail:** A high-power Steel-type move (100 Power) with a 30% chance to lower the target's Defense.
    * **Thief:** A Dark-type move (60 Power) that steals the target's held item (as noted in the Sword/Shield flavor text).
    * **Dragon Rage:** Deals fixed 40 HP damage (Gen I).
    * **Smack Down:** Knocks Flying-type/Levitating Pokémon to the ground (Gen V-VII).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche to Moderate.** Iron Tail was historically used by non-Steel types (like Haxorus or Pikachu) for coverage against Fairy and Ice types, though its low accuracy (75%) makes it a risky choice. **Thief** is a staple in playthroughs and certain "Item-less" competitive sets to disrupt opponent strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for move-set customization. Compatible Pokémon vary wildly depending on whether the TM contains a Steel, Dark, or Rock-type move.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at large Department Stores (such as **Lilycove City** or **Celadon City**) or awarded by Gym Leaders (e.g., Jasmine in Johto after her defeat). In Generation IX, it is crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through exploration, Gym rewards, or high-tier Poké Marts. Its high price point (10,000) reflects its status as a provider of powerful mid-to-late-game coverage moves.
