## Identity & Utility
**Pikashunium Z** (internal ID: `pikashunium-z--bag`) is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized, Pokémon-specific Z-Crystal. It serves to convert Z-Power into a unique crystalline energy that upgrades a specific move into an exclusive, high-powered Z-Move. It is a **Held Item** that is **not consumable**; once used in battle, it remains with the Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). As a Z-Crystal, it is a special acquisition and cannot be sold at Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Pikachu wearing a cap** (Cap Pikachu) that knows the move **Thunderbolt**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt**. 
    * This Z-Move has a base power of **195** and an increased critical-hit ratio (+2 stages, resulting in a 50% chance to crit).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed by moves like Thief or Knock Off.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** While 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt is incredibly powerful and has a high critical hit rate, its utility is limited by the fact that it can only be used by "Cap Pikachu" variants. These Pikachu have the same base stats as a standard Pikachu and cannot hold the Light Ball while holding this crystal, significantly limiting their general damage output compared to standard competitive Pikachu sets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Thunderbolt** move and is restricted exclusively to the various "Cap Pikachu" forms (Original, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Partner caps).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained through special distributions or specific NPCs. In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained in **Pikachu Valley** from a Pikachu if the player has a Cap Pikachu in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a unique event-related item that must be gifted to or found by the player.
* **Lore context:** The crystal represents the bond between Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, as the Z-Move itself is a signature maneuver from the Pokémon anime.
