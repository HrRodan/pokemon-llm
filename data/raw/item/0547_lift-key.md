## Identity & Utility
**Lift Key** is a Plot Advancement item introduced in Generation I (and featured in Generation III's Kanto remakes).
* **Description:** A specialized key used to operate the elevator within the Team Rocket Hideout beneath the Celadon City Game Corner. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or discarded. It bears the recognizable Team Rocket logo, marking it as an official piece of the organization's infrastructure.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Operates the elevator in the Team Rocket Hideout in Celadon City. This allows the player to access different floors, most notably reaching the lower levels where the boss, Giovanni, is located.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a mandatory quest item for the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It serves as a narrative gate; obtaining it is a prerequisite for acquiring the **Silph Scope**, which is necessary to identify the Marowak ghost in the Pokémon Tower and progress the story.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained by defeating a specific Team Rocket Grunt in the Celadon Hideout (usually located on floor B4F). Once the Grunt is defeated, they drop the key, allowing the player to pick it up.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. As a unique Key Item, it cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to the Team Rocket questline in the Kanto-based games.
