* **Description:** A biological byproduct dropped by members of the Yanma evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** used primarily at the TM Machine. While it can be sold for a small amount of League Points (LP) or Poké Dollars, its primary value is as a crafting reagent.
* **Cost:** 35 Poké Dollars/LP (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient in the construction of Technical Machines (TMs) at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. It has no direct impact on battle mechanics, serves strictly as a resource for move acquisition.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a component for the Generation IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Yanma or Yanmega. In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, these are primarily found in the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item does not appear as a traditional "held item" but is dropped into the player's inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is most efficiently gathered via the **"Let's Go!"** auto-battle mechanic in areas where Yanma congregate, such as the Apple Hills or Kitakami Wilds.
* **Crafting Context:** Based on the TM Machine recipes, this material is typically required to craft moves associated with the Yanma line's characteristics, such as **TM162 (Bug Buzz)** and **TM105 (Heal Pulse)**.
