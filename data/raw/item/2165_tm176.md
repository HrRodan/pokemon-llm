## Identity & Utility
**TM176 (Sand Tomb)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask DLC)**.
* **Description:** This TM teaches the move **Sand Tomb** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Kitakami regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine. While it has no resale value (Cost 0), it is a vital tool for teaching Ground-type utility moves.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; obtained via crafting or world exploration).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sand Tomb**, a Physical Ground-type move with 35 Power and 85% Accuracy. Beyond initial damage, it traps the target for 4–5 turns, preventing switching and dealing 1/8th of the target's maximum HP as damage at the end of each turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be effectively used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Tactical Utility.** Sand Tomb is primarily used in competitive play (Smogon/VGC) for "Trapping" strategies. It is effective on defensive Pokémon or "Perish Song" users to prevent an opponent from switching out to clear the song count or to stall out a specific threat with passive damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. The crafting recipe specifically requires materials gathered from Ground-type Pokémon like **Sandshrew** and **Silicobra**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Crafting:** Can be manufactured at any Pokémon Center TM Machine using **1,500 League Points (LP)**, **3 Sandshrew Claws**, and **3 Silicobra Sand**.
    * **Field Location:** Found as a collectible item in the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to create it are farmed from wild **Sandshrew, Sandslash, Silicobra,** and **Sandaconda**.
