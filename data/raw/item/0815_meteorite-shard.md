## Identity & Utility
**Meteorite-shard** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI** (though metadata highlights its appearance in Generation VII).
* **Description:** A fragment of a Meteorite originally discovered in Hoenn's Granite Cave. It is described as being faintly warm to the touch. As a Key Item, it cannot be consumed, held by a Pokémon in battle, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Meteorite Shard acts as a narrative catalyst. When obtained during the Delta Episode, it causes the standard Meteorite to transform into its final, most powerful form.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A.** This is a story-essential item. However, it is fundamentally linked to **Mega Rayquaza**, one of the most powerful entities in competitive history (Ubers/Anything Goes tiers). In the lore, this shard enables Rayquaza to consume the energy required to Mega Evolve. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the prerequisite for unlocking the full potential of the Meteorite. While Rayquaza specifically requires the move **Dragon Ascent** to Mega Evolve, the Meteorite Shard is the plot device that facilitates the transformation of the stone that empowers the Legendary Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively through story progression during the **Delta Episode** (specifically in the Hoenn remakes, *Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*). It is given to the player by Zinnia or found during the sequence involving the Mossdeep Space Center and Granite Cave.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact tied to the Draconid people and the protection of the planet from celestial threats.
