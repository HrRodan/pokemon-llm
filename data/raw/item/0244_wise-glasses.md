## Identity & Utility
**Wise Glasses** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A pair of thick-lensed glasses designed to be held by a Pokémon. It provides a consistent, passive increase to the power of Special attacks without requiring a specific move type or inflicting negative side effects on the user. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that is typically available through specialized shops or battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**; often reflects its status as a mid-tier competitive reward or Battle Frontier prize).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the damage of the holder's **Special moves by 10% (a 1.1x multiplier)**. Unlike the Choice Specs, it does not lock the user into a single move, and unlike the Life Orb, it does not drain the user's HP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Considered a **Niche/Entry-level** competitive item. While it provides a safe boost, it is generally outclassed by **Life Orb** (30% boost) for glass cannons or **Choice Specs** (50% boost) for wall-breakers. It is most effective on "bulky attackers" who cannot afford Life Orb recoil and require the freedom to switch between different Special moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a combat-enhancement tool and remains active as long as the Pokémon is not under the effect of "Embargo," "Magic Room," or the ability "Klutz."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in post-game Battle Facilities (such as the Battle Frontier or Battle Maison) for BP, or as a late-game find in various regions (e.g., Celadon Dept. Store in certain generations or Eternal City in Sinnoh).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon** (total_held_by: 0), making it a rare acquisition usually obtained through fixed world locations or currency exchanges rather than farming or the **Pickup** ability.
