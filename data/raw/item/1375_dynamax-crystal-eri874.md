## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (eri874)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used exclusively in the Galar Wild Area. When brought to the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay progression.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominally Cheap**; however, this item is typically distributed via serial codes or special events and is not sold in standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (encoded as "eri874") to appear in a Max Raid Battle. The raid persists until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is entirely restricted to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a Raid. The Pokémon caught from these raids may have competitive value (e.g., Hidden Abilities or high IVs), but the crystal itself has no battle application.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is strictly a trigger for the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic and is consumed immediately upon the activation of the den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed as **Event Serial Codes**. Specifically, codes like "eri874" were often tied to pre-order bonuses (such as those for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass or retail collaborations like those with Pokémon Center or Target). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is an external catalyst for encounters rather than an item naturally integrated into the Pokémon ecosystem. It is a manifestation of the **Dynamax phenomenon** focused into a portable crystalline form.
