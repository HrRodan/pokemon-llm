## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Aqr8264** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a pillar of light that causes a specific Pokémon (associated with code Aqr8264) to appear in a Max Raid Battle until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this price is a placeholder as the item is typically obtained via serial code distribution rather than a shop).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty den at the Watchtower Lair, the crystal is consumed to force a **Max Raid Battle** encounter. This encounter allows the player (and invited allies) to battle and attempt to catch a specific Pokémon, often one that is rare or possesses a **Gigantamax** factor or a **Hidden Ability**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) progression and collection. It serves as a tool for obtaining competitive-ready Pokémon, rather than being used in a battle itself.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used to facilitate a Dynamax/Gigantamax encounter. It bypasses the standard "Wishing Piece" mechanic for the specific Watchtower Lair location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional item via serial codes (often through retailers like GameStop, Pokémon Center, or CoroCoro Magazine). It is not available for purchase at any in-game Poké Mart or Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly external "Key-style" consumable provided through official Nintendo/The Pokémon Company events.
