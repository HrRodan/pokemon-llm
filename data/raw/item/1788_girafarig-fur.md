## Identity & Utility
**Girafarig Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Girafarig evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers to craft Technical Machines (TMs). It serves as a required component for specific moves, most notably those associated with Psychic-type or versatile Normal-type maneuvers (e.g., **TM059 Zen Headbutt** or **TM098 Skill Swap**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a battle sequence).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for move-pool customization outside of battle. Its value is derived entirely from the TMs it produces, which are essential for building competitive kits for various Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While not used to evolve Pokémon directly, it is a byproduct of the Girafarig line, including its Paldean evolution, **Farigiraf**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching a wild **Girafarig** or **Farigiraf**. It is not sold in traditional Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is added directly to the player's materials bag upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Girafarig line in the Paldea region. It can also be found as shimmering pickups on the ground in habitats where Girafarig reside (such as the West Province).
