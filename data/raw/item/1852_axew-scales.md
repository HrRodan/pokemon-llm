## Identity & Utility
**Axew Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** These are scales shed by members of the Axew evolutionary line. As a material specifically categorized under TM-materials, it serves as a specialized crafting ingredient rather than a consumable medicine or a held item. It cannot be used directly from the bag to produce an effect on a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard material value). While they can be sold for a small amount, their primary value lies in their utility at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to craft specific TMs. In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, Axew Scales are notably required to craft high-value physical Dragon-type moves, such as **TM078 (Dragon Claw)** and **TM100 (Dragon Dance)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. The item itself has no presence in competitive battles, though the moves it helps craft (especially **Dragon Dance**) are foundational to the competitive meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the crafting system introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Axew evolutionary line (**Axew**, **Fraxure**, and **Haxorus**). They are commonly farmed in areas like the North Province (Area Two) or Mount Glaseado in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense of previous generations, these materials are automatically added to the player's inventory upon a successful encounter with wild **Axew**, **Fraxure**, or **Haxorus**. They are often gathered in bulk for players looking to optimize their move pools via TM crafting.
