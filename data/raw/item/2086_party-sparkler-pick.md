## Identity & Utility
**Party Sparkler Pick** is a **Picnic Accessory** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This is a decorative consumable used during the sandwich-making process at Pokémon Picnics. It serves as the final component to "set" a sandwich, holding the layers together. As a festive cosmetic item, it adds a celebratory visual flair to the completed meal. It is a **Consumable** item that **Can** be bought at specialty shops.
* **Cost:** 1,600 Poké Dollars (**Standard/Mid-range price** for specialized picnic picks).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the end of the sandwich-making mini-game, it secures the sandwich ingredients. While the pick itself does not alter the specific "Meal Powers" (such as Sparkling Power or Encounter Power) provided by the ingredients, it is a required component to complete the process and activate those buffs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld Picnic mechanic to facilitate Shiny hunting, EV training, or Raid power buffs through Meal Powers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is categorized under "Picnic" items and does not interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available at Paldean grocery and sandwich supply stores, specifically **Sure Cans**, **Every Wich Way**, and **Aguila Supermarket** locations across the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or certain ingredients, picks are manufactured goods that must be purchased from retail outlets.
* **Context:** In the Paldean culture of sandwich-making, the pick is the "final touch." The Party Sparkler variant is used by trainers looking to add a festive, high-energy aesthetic to their picnic table compared to the standard Silver or Red picks.
