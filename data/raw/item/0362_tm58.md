## Identity & Utility
**TM58** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** This item is a reusable (Gen V–VIII) or consumable (Gen IV, Gen IX) data disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. Its identity is unique because the move it teaches changed significantly between generations: it taught **Endure** in Gen IV and was updated to teach **Sky Drop** from Gen V onwards.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sky Drop** to a compatible Pokémon (or **Endure** in Gen IV). 
    * *Sky Drop:* A Flying-type physical move where the user takes the target into the sky on the first turn and drops them on the second. While in the sky, neither the user nor the target can be hit by most moves, and the target cannot perform any actions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Sky Drop:** This move is a **Tactical Niche** in Double Battles (VGC). It is used to temporarily "remove" a dangerous opponent from the field to allow a partner to setup or knock out the remaining foe. It was famously banned in Generation V competitive play due to a game-breaking glitch involving the move *Gravity*.
        * **Endure (Gen IV):** A staple for "Pinch" strategies, allowing a Pokémon to survive any hit with 1 HP to activate Berries (like Salac or Liechi) or maximize the power of moves like *Flail* and *Reversal*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Flying-type Pokémon (for Sky Drop) or almost all Pokémon (for Endure).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In later generations, TM58 is typically found in locations associated with flight or height. In the Unova region, it is found in **Mistralton City**; in Galar, it is available in the **Wild Area**. In Generation IX, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or certain Hold Items, TMs must be found as overworld items, received from NPCs, or purchased from specialized Marts/TM Machines.
