## Identity & Utility
**Bach's Food Tin** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized canned good sold by a character named Bach. It is used exclusively as a cooking component during Pokémon Camp to create various tiers of Curry. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that is specifically linked to the culinary culture of the Galar region.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). While not as cheap as basic berries, it is affordable for mid-game players looking to complete their Curry Dex.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Pokémon Camp cooking mini-game, it produces **Bach's Food Tin Curry**. Depending on the berries added and the quality of the cooking, this curry restores the party's HP and PP, provides Experience Points, and increases the Pokémon's friendliness (Affection).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Surprisingly high for a food item, though rarely used as it must be held by the Pokémon, which prevents the use of more competitive items).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is purely for the single-player campaign and social mechanics (Nuzlockes/Playthroughs). It cannot be used in ranked VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** There is no direct evolution interaction. However, it is a **Version-Exclusive** mechanic: Bach's Food Tin is primarily found in **Pokémon Shield**, while its counterpart, Bob's Food Tin, is found in **Pokémon Sword**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased from **Ingredients Sellers** located in the Wild Area (such as the Rolling Fields or Hammerlocke Hills). It is also frequently rewarded for completing certain **Poké Jobs**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. In the Galar region, it is strictly a commercial product sold by vendors.
* **Completionist Note:** To complete the "Curry Dex" in *Pokémon Sword*, players must trade for a Pokémon holding a Bach's Food Tin from a *Pokémon Shield* player, as the item is otherwise unobtainable in that version.
