## Identity & Utility
**TM177 (Agility)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**. 
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Agility**. Within the Generation IX ecosystem, TMs are consumable but can be infinitely reproduced if the player has the necessary materials and League Points (LP). 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted at a TM Machine using 800 LP and specific Pokémon materials (3x Fletchling Feathers and 3x Oricorio Feathers).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently teaches the move **Agility** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Agility is a Psychic-type status move that sharpens the user's movements to drastically raise its **Speed stat (by two stages/ +100%)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** This TM is a staple for "Setup Sweepers." By doubling their Speed in a single turn, slower but powerful attackers (like Kingambit or various Paradox Pokémon) can bypass their natural disadvantage and "sweep" through an opponent's team. It is frequently seen in both VGC (Doubles) and Smogon (Singles) formats to counteract Speed Creep.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a pedagogical item for expanding a Pokémon's movepool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item on the ground in the **Paldea region** or provided as a reward for registered progress. It is also available in the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC). Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked for the **TM Machine** located at any Pokémon Center.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is restricted to overworld discovery or crafting using materials gathered from wild **Fletchling** and **Oricorio**.
