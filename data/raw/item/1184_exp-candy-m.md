## Identity & Utility
**Exp. Candy M** is a **Vitamin / Consumable Medicine** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A candy packed with energy used to facilitate rapid growth. When consumed from the bag, it grants a single Pokémon a moderate amount of Experience Points. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily obtained through gameplay rewards rather than standard Poké Mart vendors.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Accessible, though primarily acquired as a raid reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly grants exactly **3,000 Experience Points** to a Pokémon. Unlike a Rare Candy, which increases a Pokémon's level by one regardless of their current XP requirement, Exp. Candy M provides a fixed numerical value. It is the third tier in the Exp. Candy hierarchy (XS < S < **M** < L < XL).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no utility in active PvP battles, it is a **foundational utility item** for competitive teambuilding. It allows players to bypass traditional "grinding" to quickly bring Pokémon to Level 50 (the standard for VGC and Battle Stadium Singles) or Level 100 (for Hyper Training).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Consumption can trigger a level-up, which in turn can trigger level-based evolutions. It is more efficient than a Rare Candy for low-to-mid-level Pokémon but becomes less efficient at very high levels where level-up requirements exceed 3,000 XP.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for completing **3-Star and 4-Star Max Raid Battles** (Sword/Shield) or **3-Star and 4-Star Tera Raid Battles** (Scarlet/Violet). It can also be found as a sparkling item on the ground in the Wild Area or Area Zero.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is generally considered a "Modern Era" mechanic designed to respect the player's time by streamlining the leveling process compared to older generations.
