## Identity & Utility
**TR03** is a **Technical Record (TR)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**. 
* **Description:** It is a single-use move-teaching item that allows a Pokémon to learn the high-intensity Water-type move **Hydro Pump**. Unlike standard TMs in its debut generation, a TR is consumed upon use. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that can be purchased primarily through specialized vendors.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars / Watts (**Expensive**). Its high price reflects the significant power of the move it teaches.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hydro Pump** to a compatible Pokémon. Hydro Pump is a premier Special Water-type move with a Base Power of 110 and an Accuracy of 80%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 110. Using Fling with TR03 deals massive physical damage, matching its internal power rating, though the item is destroyed in the process.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Hydro Pump is the go-to choice for Special Attackers (such as Rotom-Wash, Primarina, or Inteleon) that require more immediate "wall-breaking" power than the more accurate but weaker Surf. It is a defining move in both VGC and Smogon singles formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for move set customization. It cannot be used if a Pokémon is incompatible with Water-type high-pressure mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR03 is primarily obtained via **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 8,000 Watts (the price varies daily). It is also a frequent reward for defeating Water-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered through the **Galar Max Raid** ecosystem or by exchanging Watts earned through exploring the overworld. In the game's economy, it serves as a reward for high-level PvE engagement.
