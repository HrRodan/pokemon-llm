## Identity & Utility
**Green Bell Pepper** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A sliced culinary ingredient used exclusively within the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable item specifically designed for the Paldean "Meal Power" system. It can be purchased freely at food-specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 230 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, the Green Bell Pepper adds specific values to the sandwich's internal stats. It provides a boost to **Salty** and **Bitter** flavors. In terms of Meal Powers, it is a key component for recipes targeting **Poison-type** (Encounter Power), **Ground-type** (Raid Power), and **Flying-type** (Catching Power) bonuses.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Mechanic-specific).** It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be brought into a battle. Its "competitive" value is indirect, as it is used to craft sandwiches that facilitate Shiny Hunting (Sparkling Power) or Breeding (Egg Power) for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized grocery retailers in the Paldea region, most notably **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Every Wich Way** branches after the player has obtained a specific number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or Medicines, sandwich ingredients are managed in a separate inventory pouch and are not part of the standard loot table for wild encounters or the Pickup ability.
