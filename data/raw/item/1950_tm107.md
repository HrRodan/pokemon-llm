## Identity & Utility
**TM107 (Will-O-Wisp)** is a **Machine** item introduced in its current iteration during **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Machine teaches the move **Will-O-Wisp** to compatible Pokémon. It is a **Consumable/Craftable** item in modern generations, meaning it is typically used once but can be recreated using specific materials at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, it is acquired through exploration or crafted using **3,000 LP**, **3 Salandit Gas**, and **3 Litwick Soot**.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Will-O-Wisp**. This is a Fire-type Status move with 85% accuracy that inflicts the **Burn** status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility.** Will-O-Wisp is a cornerstone of competitive play (VGC and Smogon). The Burn status is invaluable because it **halves the target's Physical Attack stat** and deals chip damage every turn. It is essential for neutralizing physical "sweepers" like Zacian, Dragonite, or Groudon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "teaching" item intended to expand a Pokémon's movepool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the overworld (notably in the **Dalizapa Passage** in Paldea). Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked at any **TM Machine** located at Pokémon Centers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Salandit**, **Salazzle**, **Litwick**, **Lampent**, and **Chandelure**. 
* **Historical Context:** While TM numbers change between generations, TM107 specifically represents Will-O-Wisp within the Generation IX technical machine listing, including *The Indigo Disk* DLC.
