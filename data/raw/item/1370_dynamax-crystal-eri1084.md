## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ERI1084** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event/Summoning Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special promotional item used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that remains active until the end of the calendar day. It is a **consumable event item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a internal cost value, it is functionally a **Promotional Distribution** item typically obtained via serial codes rather than Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Using this item at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone den in the Wild Area) causes a beam of light to appear, initiating a **Max Raid Battle**. The specific Pokémon encountered is determined by the internal ID of the crystal (typically used for rare or Gigantamax encounters like Eevee, Pikachu, or Larvitar/Jangmo-o during specific retail events).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a strictly PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching rare Pokémon, farming Dynamax Candy, or obtaining Pokémon with Hidden Abilities/Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a **Serial Code** event item, often through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or EB Games) or as a pre-order bonus for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* expansions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This item is unique to the player's inventory via external distribution and cannot be farmed using abilities like **Pickup** or **Thief**.
* **Lore context:** The "ERI" series of crystals are part of a larger set of "Star" or "Dynamax" crystals used to bridge the gap between physical retail locations and in-game rare encounters, centering the gameplay on the Wild Area's Raid mechanics.
