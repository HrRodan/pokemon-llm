## Identity & Utility
**Basement Key (Goldenrod)** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in this specific data entry) associated with the Johto region, though this specific iteration is logged in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A specialized key designed to unlock a door within the Goldenrod Tunnel. It is a **Key Item** that is critical for story progression and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Goldenrod Tunnel, it unlocks the door leading to the warehouse/basement area beneath the Goldenrod Radio Tower. This area is essential for clearing the Team Rocket occupation of the city.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression-based item used strictly within the overworld during the main story.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts purely with the environment (locked doors) to allow the player to confront Team Rocket and rescue the Radio Tower Director.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the context of the Johto narrative (Gold/Silver/Crystal and HeartGold/SoulSilver), it is obtained from the **Director of the Radio Tower** (or the Impostor Director) after the player defeats him. In this Generation VII data, it exists as a legacy item or placeholder, likely to maintain compatibility with Virtual Console transfers or code-side consistency for the Johto setting.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is unique and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** The Goldenrod Tunnel basement is a notorious labyrinth where players must navigate shutters and gates. This key serves as the final barrier between the player and the deeper storage area where the real Director is held captive.
