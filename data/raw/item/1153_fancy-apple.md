## Identity & Utility
**Fancy Apple** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An exceptionally high-quality fruit characterized by its spectacular form and brilliant sheen. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** primarily used in the Pokémon Camp's cooking mechanic. While it has a high resale value, it cannot be held by a Pokémon for passive battle benefits.
* **Cost:** 2200 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**). Compared to basic ingredients like Bread or Pasta, the Fancy Apple is a premium additive.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a base ingredient in **Pokémon Camp** to create various types of Curry (e.g., Apple Curry). Using high-quality ingredients like the Fancy Apple increases the likelihood of achieving a higher-tier cooking result (such as Copperajah or Charizard Class), which provides greater HP/PP restoration and higher Experience Point gains for the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low impact; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it provides no held-item bonuses and cannot be used as medicine during a battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly for the Curry Dex and has no known evolutionary properties or interactions with abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Ingredient Sellers:** Occasionally sold by the fluctuating inventory of the Ingredient Sellers located in the **Galar Wild Area** (Rolling Fields or Hammerlocke Hills).
    * **Foraging:** Frequently found as a "sparkling" hidden item on the ground throughout the Wild Area, particularly under trees. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found held by wild Pokémon; it is primarily gathered through overworld exploration or purchase. Its high cost makes it a viable item for early-game players to sell if they are not focusing on completing the Curry Dex.
