## Identity & Utility
**Moon Ball** is an **Apricorn Ball** introduced in Generation II (re-introduced in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball crafted from Yellow Apricorns. It is designed specifically to capture Pokémon belonging to evolutionary families that utilize a Moon Stone. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value lies in its rarity and specific crafting requirements.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a wild Pokémon, it applies a **4× Catch Rate multiplier** if the target is part of an evolutionary line that evolves via a **Moon Stone**. Otherwise, it functions as a standard Poké Ball (1× multiplier).
    * *Eligible Families include:* The **Nidoran** (M/F) lines, **Clefairy** line, **Jigglypuff** line, **Skitty** line, and **Munna** line.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with Fling in a way that provides damage or secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no mechanical benefit in battle, it is a highly coveted **Aesthetic Ball**. In the competitive community, "Aprimons" (Pokémon in Apricorn Balls) are considered high-value collectibles, often traded for their distinct moon-themed entrance animation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly rewards knowledge of the **Moon Stone** evolution mechanic. It has no effect on the evolution process itself but is the only ball that specifically triggers a bonus based on an evolution item requirement.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically crafted by the specialist **Kurt in Azalea Town** (Johto region) using **Yellow Apricorns**. In later generations, it is often obtained as a one-time gift from NPCs (such as Professor Samson Oak in Alola) or through high-tier lottery rewards and special events.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It must be crafted or received as a rare reward, making it a "limited resource" in most playthroughs.
* **Nuzlocke Context:** Highly valuable for guaranteed captures of specific encounters like Nidoking/Nidoqueen or Clefable, which are often top-tier "encounters" due to their diverse movepools.
