## Identity & Utility
**Scatterbug Powder** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This is a crafting ingredient shed by the Scatterbug evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** used primarily at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. While it can be sold, its primary utility is as a currency for move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). In the context of Paldean economy, it is often exchanged for small amounts of League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component in recipes to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points and other materials, it allows the player to "print" multi-use moves for their team.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on competitive battles; it is a resource-management item for the single-player campaign and team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a direct drop from the **Scatterbug**, **Spewpa**, and **Vivillon** evolutionary family. It interacts with the **TM Machine mechanics** introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching wild members of the Scatterbug line. It is a common early-game drop found in grassy areas of the **South Province** in Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is automatically added to the player's "TM Materials" inventory pocket upon the conclusion of an encounter with a wild **Scatterbug**, **Spewpa**, or **Vivillon**. It is frequently gathered in bulk by players looking to craft early-game Bug-type TMs (such as **TM015 Struggle Bug** or **TM021 Pounce**).
