## Identity & Utility
**TM170 (Steel Beam)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation VIII** (and specifically categorized under the TM Machine system in **Generation IX**).
* **Description:** This Technical Machine teaches the move **Steel Beam** to compatible Pokémon. In the context of *Scarlet, Violet,* and *The Teal Mask*, it represents a single-use data disc that can be replicated using the TM Machine. It is a **Consumable/Craftable** item that cannot be purchased with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; requires **12,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Steel Beam**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A devastating Steel-type Special attack with **140 Base Power**. 
    * **Recoil Mechanic:** Upon successful execution, the user sacrifices **50% of its maximum HP** (rounded up). This effect occurs even if the user has the ability *Magic Guard*, but is prevented if the move misses or is blocked by *Protect*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **High-Utility "Nuke"** move. It is a staple on Special Attackers like **Gholdengo** and **Archaludon** to deal massive burst damage or to safely "faint" a Pokémon to bring in a teammate without a "slow switch." It is frequently used in VGC and Smogon formats as a final gambit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily interacted with by the **TM Machine** mechanic in Gen IX.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Scarlet & Violet* (specifically the DLC expansions like *The Teal Mask* and *The Indigo Disk*), TM170 is obtained via exploration in the **Terarium** or by defeating specific Trainers. Once found, it can be crafted at any Pokémon Center.
* **Crafting Requirements:**
    * 12,000 LP
    * 5× Magnemite Surplus
    * 3× Orthworm Tarnish
    * 3× Cufant Tarnish
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; the required crafting materials, however, must be farmed from wild **Magnemite**, **Orthworm**, and **Cufant** lines.
