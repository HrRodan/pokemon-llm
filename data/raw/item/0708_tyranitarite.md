## Identity & Utility
**Tyranitarite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious held item that enables a specific species—Tyranitar—to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. As a Mega Stone, it is a permanent, non-consumable item that remains with the Pokémon throughout the duel. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a rare, high-value artifact typically obtained through specific post-game events or hidden locations rather than retail purchase.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Tyranitar, the Trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution**, transforming the Pokémon into **Mega Tyranitar**. This transformation significantly boosts Tyranitar's Attack, Defense, and Special Defense stats and refreshes the **Sand Stream** ability, ensuring Sandstorm weather is active upon transformation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: Under standard battle rules, Mega Stones cannot be removed, stolen, or Flung if the holder can use them to Mega Evolve).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as Gen VI/VII Smogon OU or specific VGC years), Tyranitarite is a top-tier choice. It turns an already powerful Pseudo-Legendary into an apical tank and physical sweeper, capable of surviving powerful special attacks thanks to the Rock-type's Special Defense boost in Sandstorms.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to **Tyranitar**. It does not affect its pre-evolutions, Larvitar or Pupitar. It functions independently of the "Klutz" ability (which prevents the use of held items) regarding the actual transformation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually discovered in the post-game. In *Pokémon X*, it is found in the Cyllage Gym after upgrading the Mega Ring; in *Alpha Sapphire*, it is found on Mt. Pyre; and in *Sun/Moon*, it is purchasable via Battle Points (BP) at the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It must be found as a unique overworld item or earned through high-level battle facilities. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is a fixed-event acquisition.
