## Identity & Utility
**TR84 (Scald)** is a Technical Record (TR) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Scald** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike the TMs found in the same generation, TRs are consumed upon use, functioning as a high-value consumable resource for move set customization.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Standard cost for high-tier offensive records).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Scald**, a Water-type Special move with a Base Power of 80 and 100% Accuracy. 
* **Move Secondary Effect:** Scald has a high **30% chance to burn** the target. Additionally, using Scald will thaw the user if they are currently frozen.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Deals moderate physical damage but provides no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/Staple Utility.** Scald is widely considered one of the most influential moves in the competitive meta (VGC and Smogon). Its ability to cripple physical attackers with a burn while dealing consistent damage makes it mandatory for bulky Water-types such as Toxapex, Slowbro, and Milotic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Water-type Pokémon and some niche non-Water types (like Mew or Stunfisk).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR84 is primarily acquired by exchanging **Watts (W)** with Watt Traders located throughout the Wild Area. It is also a frequent reward for defeating Water-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its availability is tied strictly to the Galar region's TR distribution system (Watt Traders/Max Raid Battles).
* **Historical Context:** TRs were introduced to balance the accessibility of powerful moves; while TMs remained infinite-use in Gen VIII, high-impact moves like Scald were relegated to the consumable TR system to encourage exploration and raid participation.
