## Identity & Utility
**Rose Incense** is a **Type-Enhancement** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An exotic-smelling incense that serves a dual purpose as a combat booster and a breeding catalyst. It is a **Holdable** item that is actively used in battle to empower specific move types and can be purchased at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the holder’s **Grass-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low damage; provides no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. It is functionally identical to the **Miracle Seed**. While useful in playthroughs for boosting STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves without the recoil of a Life Orb, it is generally outperformed in high-level competitive play by items with higher damage ceilings or utility (e.g., Choice Specs or Life Orb).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding (Baby Trigger):** This is a mandatory item for obtaining **Budew**. If a Roselia or Roserade is left at the Pokémon Daycare or Nursery while holding this item, the resulting Egg will contain a Budew. Without this item, the Egg will hatch directly into a Roselia.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold by specialized Incense Merchants (such as those found in the Veilstone Department Store in Sinnoh, Driftveil City in Unova, or Hulbury in Galar). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or found as a Poké Ball item on the ground in specific floral or forest routes (e.g., Route 212 in Sinnoh).
* **Evolution Chain Context:** It is intrinsically linked to the Roselia evolutionary line, acting as the chemical trigger required to revert the species to its infantile "baby" stage.
