## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Leo3982)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable/Key-style** item that technically has a internal price but cannot be purchased through standard in-game Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Special Acquisition**; usually distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal causes a specific Pokémon (specifically **Larvitar** for the 'Leo' designation in the Dual Pack distributions) to appear in a Max Raid Battle. The beam is distinct from standard Wishing Piece beams and remains active until the Pokémon is defeated or the day ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the purpose of facilitating specific encounters outside of standard battle formats. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for obtaining Pokémon with specific Hidden Abilities or high IVs through a guaranteed Raid encounter.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** structure. It is consumed immediately upon the successful activation of the Raid beam.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily distributed as a promotional bonus. Specifically, "Leo" crystals were often bundled with the **Pokémon Sword and Shield Dual Pack** pre-orders or specific retail distributions to allow players to catch Pokémon that were otherwise version-exclusives (e.g., Larvitar in Pokémon Sword).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-based resource.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which draw random Pokémon from the Power Spot, these specific crystals act as a "tuner," calling forth a specific species to the Lair.
