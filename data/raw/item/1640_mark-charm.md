## Identity & Utility
**Mark Charm** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized charm that increases the likelihood of encountering wild Pokémon carrying "Marks"—special titles that appear when the Pokémon is sent into battle. It is a **Key Item** that stays in the player's inventory permanently once acquired and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the probability of a wild Pokémon having a Mark. Mechanically, it provides **two additional attempts** (for a total of three rolls) to generate a Mark upon a wild encounter. This significantly boosts the odds for both common marks (like the Uncommon Mark) and rare weather or time-specific marks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on battle stats or strategy; its value is purely cosmetic and prestigious, catering to "Mark Hunters" and collectors who seek specific titles for their team (e.g., "The Recluse" or "The Sociable").
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions similarly to the **Shiny Charm**, acting as a passive multiplier for rare world attributes. Note that it only affects **wild encounters**; Pokémon obtained via breeding or mystery gifts are unaffected.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically awarded as a completionist prize. In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, it is obtained from the scientist at the Armor Station after the player completes the **Isle of Armor Pokédex** (210 entries). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-per-save-file reward for Pokédex completion.
