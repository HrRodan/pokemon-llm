## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Atk 3** is a **Miracle-Shooter Consumable** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An enhanced, battle-only stat booster used to drastically increase offensive capabilities. Unlike standard X-Items, this is a specialized variant exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. It is a consumable battle item that cannot be used outside of active combat.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired mid-battle by spending accumulated points within the Wonder Launcher system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Raises the target Pokémon’s **Special Attack stat by three stages** (+150%, or a 2.5x multiplier). The effect is immediate but wears off if the Pokémon is withdrawn from battle (switched out).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Existent.** This item is restricted to the specific "Wonder Launcher" battle format found in Gen V. It is not legal in standard VGC, Smogon, or modern competitive formats as the mechanic was retired after Generation V.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a temporary combat buff and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Honey Gather.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item does not appear in the player's overworld bag or shops. It is accessed through the **Wonder Launcher** menu during multiplayer battles. Players must wait several turns to accumulate the required points (5 points) to "purchase" and use it during a turn.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon and cannot be farmed. It is a digital construct within the Unova region's advanced battle technology.
