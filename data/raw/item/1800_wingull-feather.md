## Identity & Utility
**Wingull Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Wingull evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting resource used at TM Machines to create Technical Machines. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold but is primarily used as a currency for move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient in the crafting recipes for various TMs in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Players must combine a specific number of Wingull Feathers with League Points (LP) to manufacture TMs such as **TM011 (Water Pulse)**, **TM022 (Chilling Water)**, or **TM065 (Air Slash)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials typically cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no utility in battle and cannot be held by a Pokémon to provide a combat bonus. Its value is strictly tied to the out-of-battle move-teaching economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized as "Loot" or "Material" and does not interact with abilities like Pickup in the traditional sense, as it is a direct drop from combat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop from defeating or catching wild **Wingull** or **Pelipper**. It is commonly found in coastal regions, beaches, and over-ocean biomes where these bird Pokémon congregate.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the classic sense (it doesn't appear in the held item slot), it is a guaranteed drop from the **Wingull** evolutionary line upon their defeat in the wild or through Auto-Battles (Let's Go feature).
* **Context:** The Wingull Feather represents the "crafting" era of Pokémon, where move availability is tied to interacting with the local ecology rather than just finding items on the ground or purchasing them from a shop.
