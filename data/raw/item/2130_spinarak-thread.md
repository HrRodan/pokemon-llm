## Identity & Utility
**Spinarak Thread** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A crafting resource dropped by members of the Spinarak evolutionary line. It is a consumable material specifically used at the TM Machine to manufacture Technical Machines. As a raw material, it is considered a "Treasure" or "Ingredient" rather than a held item.
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Minimal resale value; its primary value is in crafting rather than liquidation).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required component for crafting specific TMs at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. Players must combine this material with League Points (LP) to create moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly restricted to the preparation phase of competitive play (obtaining the necessary moves for a team's moveset).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is uniquely tied to the **Spinarak** and **Ariados** species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Spinarak** or **Ariados**. In the context of Generation IX, these are found primarily in the **Land of Kitakami** (Teal Mask DLC).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a drop reward. Unlike items found via the **Pickup** ability, TM materials are specifically gathered through direct combat or successful captures of the corresponding Pokémon species.
* **Lore Context:** Spinarak is known as the "String Spit Pokémon," famous for weaving sturdy webs. The Spinarak Thread represents the silk harvested from these encounters, repurposed by modern technology into data for TMs.
