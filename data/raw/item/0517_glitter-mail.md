## Identity & Utility
**Glitter Mail** is a **Mail Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn/Kanto)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a "cute Pikachu print." It is a **Consumable/Held** item used for social communication. Once a message is composed using a predetermined list of words, it is given to a Pokémon to hold. It can be bought at most Poke Marts in its debut generations.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to write a short message and attach it to a Pokémon. This message is intended to be read by another player upon trading. Once the message is read by the recipient, the item can be cleared and reused, or the message can be archived in the Trainer's PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Defensive Utility.** In older generations, Mail had a unique mechanical property: it **cannot be removed or stolen** by moves like *Thief*, *Knock Off*, *Covet*, or *Trick*. While it provides no stat bonuses, it was occasionally used in specific historical formats to protect a Pokémon from losing its "held item" slot or to prevent item-swapping tactics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Glitter Mail **cannot be placed into the PC storage system**. The mail must be removed before the Pokémon can be deposited.
    * **Item Protection:** Moves attempting to forcibly remove or transfer this item from the holder will fail.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Regularly available for purchase at Pokémon Marts (notably in the Hoenn and Kanto regions during Gen III). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased and equipped by the Trainer.
* **Lore:** Glitter Mail represents the "social" era of Pokémon before advanced online messaging, where players used "Easy Chat" words to communicate intentions or greetings during local Link Cable trades. Its specific Pikachu print makes it a collector’s item for aesthetic-focused Trainers.
