## Identity & Utility
**Snowball** is a **Competitive Held Item (Consumable)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized combat consumable designed to be held by a Pokémon. It triggers specifically when the holder is struck by a damaging Ice-type move, consuming the item to provide a physical offensive boost. It is a single-use item in standard play but is restored after battles in competitive formats (VGC/Battle Tower).
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Specialized Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a damaging **Ice-type move**, its **Attack** stat is increased by one stage (+1). The item is consumed immediately upon activation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is considered a **Niche Item**. While it functions similarly to a *Weakness Policy*, it is more limited as it only responds to one specific type. Its primary competitive application is in **Double Battles**, where a teammate might use a low-damage priority move like *Ice Shard* on an ally to safely trigger the Attack boost and potentially activate the ability **Unburden**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** As a consumable held item, it synergizes with Pokémon that benefit from item loss (e.g., those with the **Unburden** ability or **Harvest** in specific weather conditions, though Harvest typically applies to Berries). It does not trigger if the holder has the ability *Sap Sipper* (if the move were Grass) or if the move is blocked by *Protect*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in Battle Facilities (like the Battle Maison or Battle Tree) for BP or purchased in specialized high-end boutiques in later generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item can be actively farmed from wild Pokémon. It is occasionally held by wild **Snorunt**, **Alolan Vulpix**, and **Alolan Ninetales**. Trainers often use the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief** and **Covet** to harvest these from wild encounters in snowy or icy regions.
