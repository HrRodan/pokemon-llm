## Identity & Utility
**Nidoran-♀ Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike standard stat-specific candies (like Health or Mighty Candies), this item is restricted to a single evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold for a nominal amount but is primarily used for Pokémon enhancement.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal resale value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a member of the **Nidoran-♀ evolutionary line**, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 **Awakening Value (AV)** simultaneously.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is used to bypass the traditional EV (Effort Value) system, allowing a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat. It is essential for "Master Trainer" battles and LGPE-specific competitive formats, though it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats from Generation VIII onwards.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This candy is strictly compatible with **Nidoran-♀**, **Nidorina**, and **Nidoqueen**. It does not work on the Nidoran-♂ line.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase in Poké Marts. It is earned through gameplay loops specific to the Kanto region in Generation VII.
* **Acquisition Method:**
    * **Catching:** Occasionally awarded for catching wild Nidoran-♀.
    * **Transferring:** Received from **Professor Oak** as a reward for transferring caught Nidoran-♀ to his lab.
    * **Catch Combos:** Farming this item is most efficient by building a "Catch Combo" of Nidoran-♀, which increases the yield and quality of candy drops.
    * **Walking:** Can be found by a Pokémon inside a Poké Ball Plus accessory when synced with the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; it is a direct inventory reward for capture and management mechanics.
