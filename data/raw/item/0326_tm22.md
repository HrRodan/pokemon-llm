## Identity & Utility
**TM22** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation I** (though the specific metadata entry originates from Generation III/Hoenn).
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool used to provide Pokémon with the move **Solar Beam**. As a Technical Machine, it represents a high-power Grass-type offensive option. Historically, TMs were single-use consumables, but they transitioned to infinite use in Gen V-VIII before returning to a craftable/consumable format in Gen IX.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Solar Beam** to a compatible Pokémon. Solar Beam is a Special Grass-type move with 120 base power (typically). It requires a charge turn unless specific weather conditions are met.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Sun Team Essential.** Solar Beam is a cornerstone of "Sun" archetypes. Under **Harsh Sunlight** (via *Sunny Day* or the *Drought* ability), the move skips its charging turn, becoming a high-accuracy, one-turn 120 BP nuke. It is frequently taught to Fire-types for coverage against Water, Ground, and Rock-type threats, and to Chlorophyll-ability Grass-types like Venusaur.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the flavor text in the provided data mentions "Large boulders" (a common indexing error in *Let's Go* where TM22 was assigned to Rock Slide), in the vast majority of the core series, TM22 is the definitive source for Solar Beam.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game environments or high-tier Department Stores (such as Celadon or Lilycove). In recent titles, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials (like Bounsweet Sweat or Tropius Leaf).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It must be found in the overworld, received from NPCs (like Gym Leader Erika in certain iterations), or purchased at specialized Marts.
* **Lore Context:** Known as one of the most iconic "Power" TMs, it has been present in every single generation's TM list, maintaining its identity as the premier Grass-type technical move.
