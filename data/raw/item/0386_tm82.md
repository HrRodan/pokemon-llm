## Identity & Utility
**TM82** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Its identity shifted significantly across the series: in Generation IV, it teaches **Sleep Talk**, but from Generation V onwards (including the modern iterations like *Scarlet/Violet*), it primarily teaches **Dragon Tail**. It is a **Consumable** (single-use in older generations) or **Infinite-Use** (Gen V-VIII) item that **Can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Modern (Dragon Tail):** A Physical Dragon-type move with 60 Power. It has negative priority (-6), meaning it strikes last, but forces the target to switch out to a random ally (or ends wild battles).
    * **Legacy (Sleep Talk):** A Status move that randomly selects and uses one of the user's other three moves. It can only be used while the Pokémon is asleep.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be Flung for damage in most generations; they are held only for trading or specific NPC interactions).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Dragon Tail:** A vital "Phazing" (Pseudo-Hazing) tool. It is used by bulky walls (like Garchomp or Tyranitar) to rack up entry hazard damage (Stealth Rock/Spikes) by forcing the opponent to cycle through their team.
        * **Sleep Talk:** A staple in "RestTalk" sets, allowing defensive Pokémon to remain active and threatening while healing via the move Rest.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, particularly Dragon-types and heavy physical attackers for Dragon Tail.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at **Department Stores** (like Veilstone or Goldenrod) or via **TM Machines** in later generations. At 1,000 Poké Dollars, it is priced as a standard mid-tier utility move.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM82 is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically obtained through overworld exploration, gym leader rewards, or TM crafting systems using materials gathered from the wild.
