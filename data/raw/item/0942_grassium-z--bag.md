## Identity & Utility
**Grassium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade a Pokémon's Grass-type moves. In the bag, it represents the player's permanent access to Grass-type Z-Moves. It is a **Key Item / Special Hold Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one **Grass-type move**, and the Trainer possesses a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring, it allows the Pokémon to unleash the Z-Move **Bloom Doom**. 
    * If the base move is a physical or special attacking move, Bloom Doom deals massive damage based on the original move's power.
    * If the base move is a status move (e.g., *Synthesis* or *Aromatherapy*), it triggers **Z-Status** effects, such as fully restoring the user's HP or clearing stat drops, in addition to the move's normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Generation VII Specific).** In Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon formats, Grassium Z was a staple for "wall-breaking." Pokémon like **Kartana**, **Tapu Bulu**, and **Serperior** used it to bypass defensive checks with a one-time high-damage nuke.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * This item is **immune to removal or theft** in battle; it cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, nor can it be suppressed by the ability *Klutz*.
    * It does not trigger any specific Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained as a reward for completing the **Trial of Mallow** at Lush Jungle on Akala Island. It is presented to the player after defeating the Totem Pokémon (Lurantis).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind Key Item/Held Item hybrid tied to the Alolan Island Challenge.
* **Internal Classification:** The `grassium-z--bag` entry specifically refers to the item's presence in the player's Z-Crystal bag/inventory, serving as the source for the crystals that can be equipped to multiple Pokémon simultaneously.
