## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR7597** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specific, event-exclusive consumable item designed to trigger a Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon (typically a Gigantamax-capable species) to appear as a raid boss. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this item is essentially priceless as it is distributed via external promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area of the Galar Wild Area) initiates a **Max Raid Battle**. The specific encounter remains active until the end of the day or until the raid is successfully completed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Acquisition Only.** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is a primary method for obtaining Pokémon with 100% guaranteed Gigantamax factors, high individual values (IVs), and Hidden Abilities for use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful spawning of the raid boss at the designated den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Only** item. Historically, "SGR" series crystals were distributed via serial codes through various global retailers (such as Best Buy, GameStop, or Pokémon Center stores) to promote specific Gigantamax encounters (e.g., Gigantamax Sandaconda or Centiskorch). It is not available in Pokémon Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it exists solely as a promotional distribution tool to drive player engagement with the Max Raid Den mechanic.
