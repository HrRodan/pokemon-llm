## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Bike (Sparkling White)** is a **Key Item variant** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized cosmetic variant of the standard Rotom Bike. It grants the player high-speed land travel, a "Turbo Boost" feature powered by Rotom, and the ability to traverse bodies of water. The "Sparkling White" edition is a premium customization that emits a brilliant, shining trail while in motion.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through gameplay events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the primary mode of transportation in the Galar region. It allows the player to move significantly faster than walking or running. Once upgraded (via story progression on Route 9), it automatically deploys pontoons to allow travel across water.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for overworld exploration and movement utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. However, the bike's speed and "Turbo" recharge rate can be upgraded by speaking to Watt Traders in the Wild Area. This specific "Sparkling White" appearance is a cosmetic choice that does not alter the bike's base performance stats but changes the player's cycling outfit to match.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific color variant is obtained in the **Isle of Armor (Sword & Shield Expansion Pass)**. Players can unlock the "Sparkling White" customization by speaking to the Bike Lady located near the Master Dojo or at various points in the Wild Area. It is an upgrade over the standard Rotom Bike colors.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of technology developed in the Galar region that merges a bicycle with a Rotom to eliminate the need for traditional HMs like Surf.
