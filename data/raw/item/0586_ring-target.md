## Identity & Utility
**Ring Target** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An item designed to be held by a Pokémon that eliminates its natural type-based defensive advantages. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought, typically at specialized shops or battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**; usually reflects its status as a technical battle tool).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon's type-based immunities are negated. For example, a Flying-type holding this item will take damage from Ground-type moves, and a Ghost-type will be vulnerable to Normal and Fighting-type attacks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no secondary status effect upon Flinging).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Tactical Disruptor.** It is virtually never used to benefit the user. Instead, it is a "Trick" item. Competitive players give it to Pokémon with the moves **Trick** or **Switcheroo** (such as Rotom or Whimsicott) to force the item onto an opponent. This allows a teammate to bypass the opponent's immunities, effectively "grounding" Flying-types or making Ghost-type walls vulnerable to STAB Normal/Fighting attacks. 
    * **Limitation:** It specifically negates **Type** immunities. It does **not** bypass **Ability** immunities (e.g., a Pokémon with Levitate or Volt Absorb will still be immune to those respective types even if holding a Ring Target).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It has a unique interaction with the ability **Klutz**, which allows the user to hold the item without suffering the loss of immunities until they successfully Trick it onto an opponent.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, this item is not found in standard Poké Marts. It is usually purchased with Battle Points (BP) in post-game facilities like the **Battle Subway**, **Battle Maison**, or **Battle Tree**, or from specialized high-end vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on any wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through BP exchange or specific overworld locations (often found in late-game areas like Route 9 in Unova).
