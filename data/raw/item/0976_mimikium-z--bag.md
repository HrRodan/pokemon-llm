## Identity & Utility
**Mimikium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (categorized as a Key Item in the bag) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade a specific move. When held by a Mimikyu that knows the move **Play Rough**, it allows the use of the exclusive Z-Move **Let's Snuggle Forever**. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through special story events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the "Bag" version of this item is obtained, the player gains access to the Mimikium Z as a held item. It serves as the catalyst for Mimikyu to perform its signature Fairy-type Z-Move, **Let's Snuggle Forever**, which has a massive **190 Base Power** and bypasses accuracy checks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with Fling and cannot be removed from the holder in battle by moves like Knock Off or Thief).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple (Gen VII).** This item was a defining feature of Mimikyu’s presence in the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon meta. Combined with Mimikyu’s "Disguise" ability, it guaranteed a safe turn to either set up Swords Dance or immediately fire off a high-damage nuke to eliminate threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It strictly interacts with Mimikyu. It requires the base move **Play Rough** to function; if the move is forgotten, the crystal cannot be activated.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific Z-Crystal is exclusive to **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is obtained after completing the trial at the **Abandoned Thrifty Megamart** and following a specific scripted event involving a "phantom" Mimikyu in the back room at night.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. This is a unique Key Item that, once obtained, is added to the Z-Crystal case and can be distributed to any Mimikyu in the player's party. Unlike standard Z-Crystals obtained during the Island Challenge, this is considered a "Signature" Z-Crystal.
