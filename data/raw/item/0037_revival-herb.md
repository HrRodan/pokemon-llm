## Identity & Utility
**Revival Herb** is a **Consumable Medicine** (Herbal Medicine) introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn Region).
* **Description:** A medicinal herb characterized by its extreme bitterness. It is a high-tier recovery item that can be used both during battle and in the overworld. While highly effective, its taste is off-putting to Pokémon, making it a "high-performance, high-cost" alternative to standard pharmaceutical medicine.
* **Cost:** 2800 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive). It is significantly more expensive than a standard Revive but serves as a purchasable alternative to the non-purchasable Max Revive.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Revives a fainted Pokémon and restores its **HP to 100%**. 
* **Side Effect (Friendship Penalty):** Due to its "terribly bitter" nature, using this item significantly **decreases the Pokémon’s Happiness/Friendship** (typically by 10 or 15 points depending on the current friendship tier).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** Not viable in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as bag items are prohibited. However, it is a **top-tier utility item for Nuzlocke challenges** and casual playthroughs, providing a reliable way to fully restore a Pokémon mid-battle when Max Revives are unavailable.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Its use can actively hinder the evolution of Pokémon that require high Friendship (e.g., Eevee, Golbat, Lucario). It has no interaction with the "Pickup" ability according to the provided data.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Unlike standard potions and revives, Revival Herbs are rarely sold in general Poké Marts. They are typically found in specialized **Herbal Shops** (such as those in Lavaridge Town, Eterna City, or Driftveil City).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from specialty vendors or found as hidden items in forest or mountainous environments.
* **Lore Context:** In the Pokémon world, herbal medicine is often depicted as a traditional, natural alternative to modern Silph Co. or Devon Corp. technology, trading palatability for potent healing properties.
