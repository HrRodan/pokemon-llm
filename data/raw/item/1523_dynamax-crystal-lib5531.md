## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Lib5531)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that is technically assigned a symbolic cost but is not available through standard in-game commerce.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Symbolic; primarily distributed via external codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty Pokémon Den in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—specifically **Larvitar** (in *Pokémon Sword*) or **Jangmo-o** (in *Pokémon Shield*)—to appear as a Dynamax boss. The raid persists until the end of the day it is activated or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely as a "ticket" to encounter a Pokémon. However, the resulting Max Raid Battle allows players to catch Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusives or unavailable until later in the game, often with guaranteed high Individual Values (IVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** location in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It does not interact with Pokémon abilities or standard evolution paths.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (Lib5531, often referred to as the "Star" Dynamax Crystal) was a **Pre-order Bonus** for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack*. Players received a serial code to redeem the item via Mystery Gift. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly limited promotional item.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals are rare fragments that concentrate Galar particles to force a Dynamax phenomenon in specific localized dens, even when there is no natural "Beam" of energy present.
