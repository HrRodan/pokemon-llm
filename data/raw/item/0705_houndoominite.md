## Identity & Utility
**Houndoominite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos Region)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized stone that enables Houndoom to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot** be bought through conventional currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Houndoom, it allows the Pokémon to transform into **Mega Houndoom** during a turn of combat. This transformation grants a massive boost to Special Attack, Defense, and Speed, and changes the Pokémon's ability to **Solar Power**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Though usable, flinging a Mega Stone is almost never recommended as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact competitive item. Mega Houndoom serves as a potent glass-cannon wallbreaker, particularly in **Sun-based teams** where its *Solar Power* ability allows it to deal devastating Fire-type damage. In Smogon formats, it has historically been a threat in the UnderUsed (UU) tier.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with Houndoom. Mega Evolution does not count as a standard evolution for the purpose of items like Eviolite. Once Mega Evolved, the item cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut in *Pokémon Y*, it was found as a hidden item on Route 16 during the post-game. In subsequent generations (like *Sun/Moon*), it was often made available via the **Battle Tree** as a reward for BP or through limited-time Mystery Gift events.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. As a unique Mega Stone, it is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is considered a rare, one-of-a-kind artifact in the lore of the games.
