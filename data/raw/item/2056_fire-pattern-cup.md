## Identity & Utility
**Fire-pattern-cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a cosmetic customization tool used during the Picnic mechanic. It allows players to change the visual theme of their picnic set, specifically replacing the standard cups with ones featuring a fire-themed pattern. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Utility** item (once purchased, it is added to the picnic set options) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 800 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, they can customize their gear. Selecting the Fire-Pattern Cup updates the visual model of the cups placed on the table. It has no impact on Sandwich recipes, Meal Powers, or Pokémon stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely aesthetic item used exclusively in the overworld picnic simulation for roleplay and customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions or interact with battle-related abilities. It is categorized strictly under the "Picnic Item" subset of the player's inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Picnic Knacks** specialty stores found in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured goods item obtained through retail purchase rather than foraging or the **Pickup** ability.
* **World Context:** In the Paldea region, picnicking is a central social activity for trainers to bond with their team and craft sandwiches. Customizing the aesthetic of the picnic—from the tablecloth to the cups—reflects the trainer's personal style, with the Fire-Pattern Cup specifically appealing to fans of Fire-type Pokémon or warm aesthetics.
