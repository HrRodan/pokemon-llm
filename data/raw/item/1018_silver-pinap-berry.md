## Identity & Utility
**Silver Pinap Berry** is a **Catching Bonus** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in the *Pokémon Let's Go* series and *Pokémon GO*).
* **Description:** A specialized, high-tier Berry used during the encounter phase. Unlike traditional Berries that provide healing or battle buffs, this is a consumable catching aid. When given to a wild Pokémon, it significantly improves the rewards gained upon a successful capture. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Expensive compared to standard Berries).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the *Let's Go* series, feeding this Berry to a wild Pokémon increases the likelihood of receiving items (such as Candies or additional Berries) after a successful catch. In the broader context of the franchise (*Pokémon GO*), it serves a dual purpose: it grants a **2.33× Candy multiplier** and increases the **Catch Rate by 1.8×**, making it a hybrid of a Razz Berry and a standard Pinap Berry.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly a utility tool for the catching mechanic and cannot be held by Pokémon in standard competitive formats (Smogon/VGC) or used for healing in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is categorized under "Catching Bonus" rather than "Held Item," meaning it lacks synergy with battle-centric abilities like *Harvest* or *Ripen*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for defeating Coach Trainers, found as hidden items in various routes, or occasionally available in specialized marts/department stores in the Alola/Kanto (Let's Go) regions. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is a tool utilized by the Trainer to influence the wild encounter outcome. In *Pokémon GO*, it is frequently acquired through Mega Raids and Research Tasks, marking it as a premium resource for maximizing rare Pokémon Candy.
