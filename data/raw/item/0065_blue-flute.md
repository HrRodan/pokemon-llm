## Identity & Utility
**Blue Flute** is a specialized **Flute** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A delicate instrument crafted from blown glass. When played, its distinct melody awakens a Pokémon from sleep. Unlike standard medicine, it is a reusable status-correction tool that can be used both during battle and in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Nominal). While the data reflects a low cost, it is historically acquired through specialized crafting rather than standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Cures a single Pokémon of the **Sleep** status condition. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Casual. In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), the **Lum Berry** or **Chesto Berry** is preferred as they trigger automatically. However, in standard playthroughs and **Nuzlocke challenges**, the Blue Flute is highly valued as an "infinite" Awakening, allowing the player to conserve funds and item slots.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with the **Pickup** ability in specific older titles (like Pokémon Emerald), where it can be found by high-level Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally obtained on **Route 113** in the Hoenn region. Players must collect **volcanic ash** in a Soot Sack and trade it to the glass blower. It requires 250 steps through ash to create.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily a crafted item or a rare find via the **Pickup** ability in early generations. 
* **World Context:** It sits in a cycle of glass flutes including the Red Flute (cures Infatuation) and Yellow Flute (cures Confusion), representing a specialized tier of "infinite use" status healers unique to certain regions.
