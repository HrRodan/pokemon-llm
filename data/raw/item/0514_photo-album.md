## Identity & Utility
**Photo Album** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in general item indexes, but functional in specific titles) introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A dedicated storage medium for snapshots taken during the trainer's journey. It acts as a digital gallery for photos captured by Cameron the Photographer at various landmarks. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a storage interface for photos. In *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*, it allows the player to view up to 36 photos taken of their character and lead Pokémon at specific "Photo Spots" across the Johto and Kanto regions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a purely aesthetic/collectible tool used for tracking "memories" and has no impact on battle stats, IVs, or EVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or trigger any combat abilities. It exists solely as a UI-driven souvenir system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically provided to the player in **Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver**. It is obtained automatically when the player first interacts with **Cameron the Photographer**, a recurring NPC found at various scenic locations throughout the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique player-exclusive item.
