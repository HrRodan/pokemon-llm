## Identity & Utility
**Kabuto Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy supplement. Unlike standard candies that boost a single stat, this species-specific variant is designed to enhance the overall potential of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought or sold for a nominal fee.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Kabuto** or **Kabutops**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by +1 **Awakening Value (AV)**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in its debut titles).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. In those games, "Candi-fed" Pokémon are significantly more powerful than standard ones. However, in "Standard" competitive rulesets (VGC or restricted online battles), AV bonuses from candies are typically disabled to maintain balance. It is primarily used for the main story, post-game Master Trainer battles, and "No-Restriction" link battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted solely to the **Kabuto evolutionary line**. It cannot be used on any other Pokémon species. It does not trigger evolution; it is purely for stat enhancement.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Let's Go era) by catching multiple Kabuto to earn catch-streak rewards or by **transferring Kabuto to Professor Oak**. Each transfer of a Kabuto-line Pokémon typically rewards the player with one of these candies.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through the **Catch Combo** mechanic or by walking with a Kabuto inside the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral. It represents the "essence" or specialized nutrition tailored to the ancient Shellfish Pokémon.
