## Identity & Utility
**Dome Fossil** is a **Dex-Completion / Fossil Item** introduced in Generation I (with significant integration into the Generation IV Sinnoh Underground mechanics).
* **Description:** A fossilized remain of a prehistoric sea-dwelling Pokémon, characterized by its shell or carapace-like structure. It is a **Consumable Restoration Item** that cannot typically be purchased in standard Poké Marts, though it holds significant value.
* **Cost:** 7000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high internal cost, it is generally found through exploration rather than retail.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specific revitalization facility (such as the Mining Museum in Oreburgh City, the Museum of Science in Pewter City, or the Devon Corporation in Rustboro), it can be regenerated into the Rock/Water-type Pokémon **Kabuto**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100. This is a remarkably high base power for the move Fling, representing the item's heavy, rock-like density, though using it this way consumes the fossil and prevents Pokémon restoration.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself provides no passive combat benefits. However, its restoration product, **Kabutops**, is a respected niche physical sweeper in competitive tiers (specifically under **Rain** weather conditions due to its *Swift Swim* ability).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item serves as the "trigger" for obtaining the Kabuto line. In many games, it is positioned as a **version-exclusive counterpart** to the Helix Fossil (Omanyte).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sinnoh (Gen IV):** Primarily obtained as a rare reward from the **Underground** mining minigame (specifically in *Pokémon FireRed* and *Pokémon SoulSilver* or based on the Trainer ID in original *Diamond/Pearl*).
    * **Kanto:** Found deep within Mt. Moon; the player must choose between the Dome Fossil and the Helix Fossil, making it a "one-per-playthrough" key decision in early generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered via environmental interaction (Mining, Rock Smash, or scripted events).
* **Lore Context:** The Dome Fossil represents an ancient lineage of predatory aquatic Pokémon. In modern fan culture, it is often juxtaposed against the Helix Fossil as a symbol of "order" or "darkness" depending on the community's "Twitch Plays Pokémon" mythos.
