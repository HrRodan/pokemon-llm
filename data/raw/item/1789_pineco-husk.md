## Identity & Utility
**Pineco Husk** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fragment of the shell discarded by a Pineco. This is a specialized crafting resource used at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it has a sell value, it is primarily valued for its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use in move-learning logistics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory reagent for crafting specific TMs in the Paldea region. Players must combine Pineco Husks with League Points (LP) to create reusable move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** While the husk itself has no competitive battle presence, it is vital for the "Preparation Phase" of competitive play, allowing trainers to teach essential moves to their team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the Pineco evolutionary line (Pineco/Forretress) and is not affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a standard held-item context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea region**. It is gathered by defeating or catching members of the Pineco evolutionary line in the wild.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. Instead, it is a **guaranteed drop** (1-3 units typically) upon the defeat or capture of wild **Pineco** or **Forretress**. 
* **Lore Context:** Pineco are known to reinforce their shells with bark and mud; the "husk" represents the durable, organic matter they shed as they grow or during combat. In the Paldean ecosystem, these durable scraps are repurposed by modern technology to encode move-data into TMs.
