## Identity & Utility
**Poké Ball** is a **Standard Poké Ball** introduced in Generation I (Data source: Generation III).
* **Description:** The iconic, fundamental device for capturing wild Pokémon. It features a specialized capsule system designed to be thrown at a target to trigger a containment sequence. It is a **Consumable** item that is **Highly Accessible** and can be bought at almost any merchant location. It represents the baseline tier of the capture hierarchy (Poké Ball < Great Ball < Ultra Ball).
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag in a battle against a wild Pokémon, it attempts a capture with a **1× Catch Rate modifier**. It is the standard metric against which all other specialized balls are measured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no mechanical benefit in competitive battling, it is a popular **Aesthetic Choice**. High-level players often challenge themselves to catch Legendaries or competitive-grade Pokémon in standard Poké Balls for the "clean" visual look of the red-and-white icon in the team preview.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. However, in most games, purchasing **10 or more** Poké Balls at once rewards the player with a **Premier Ball**, a commemorative variant with the same catch rate.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available at all Pokémon Centers and Poké Marts from the very beginning of the journey. It is often provided for free by Professors during the initial "Catching Tutorial."
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through purchase or found as "Item Balls" (field pickups) throughout all regions.
* **Lore:** The Poké Ball is the cornerstone of Pokémon society, serving as the bridge between wild creatures and human partnership. Its capsule technology is designed to convert a Pokémon into energy for storage and transport.
