## Identity & Utility
**Heracronite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, radiating stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by a Heracross in battle, it allows the Pokémon to transcend its normal form and become Mega Heracross, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Z-Power Ring. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold in standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique, non-consumable key-style item typically obtained through exploration or special NPCs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by Heracross, the "Mega Evolve" option becomes available at the start of the turn. Upon transformation, Heracross gains a massive increase in base Attack and Defense, and its ability changes to **Skill Link**, which ensures multi-strike moves (like Pin Missile and Arm Thrust) always hit the maximum five times.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In competitive play, Mega Stones generally cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Trick* if held by the correct species, making this value largely theoretical).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Wallbreaker.** Heracronite is the cornerstone of Mega Heracross builds in Smogon and past VGC formats. It transforms Heracross from a Guts-based physical attacker into one of the most powerful physical forces in the game, capable of breaking through "Stall" teams using Skill Link-boosted multi-hit moves to bypass *Substitute* and *Focus Sash*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger permanent evolution; it is a temporary mid-battle transformation. It is hard-coded to only interact with **Heracross**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (X/Y), Heracronite was version-exclusive, found in the **Santalune Forest** (specifically in Pokémon Y). In later generations like Sun/Moon, it was made available via the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP or through limited-time Mystery Gift events.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or regular items, Mega Stones are treated as unique treasures and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or *Thief*.
