## Identity & Utility
**Roto-Hatch** is a **Rotom Power** (categorized as a consumable field-effect item) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized power-up granted by the Rotom Pokédex. It is a single-use overworld consumable that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts. It functions similarly to "Pass Powers" or "O-Powers" from previous generations, focusing on party utility.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through specialized mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated, it applies a temporary buff that drastically reduces the number of steps required to hatch Pokémon Eggs currently in the player's party. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, this effect typically lasts for 10 minutes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** While it has zero impact on a battle's outcome, it is considered a "Breeder's Staple" for efficiently creating competitive-grade Pokémon by shortening the trial-and-error process of hatching for IVs, Natures, and Shiny status.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The effect of Roto-Hatch **stacks** with the overworld effects of abilities like **Flame Body** and **Magma Armor**, allowing for near-instantaneous hatching of most Egg species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively via the **Roto Loto** feature in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. Players receive this item by interacting with the Rotom Dex on the bottom screen when it shows a specific animation (glowing eyes), symbolizing a bond between the trainer and their Pokédex.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique gift generated by the Rotom Dex's internal personality and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability.
