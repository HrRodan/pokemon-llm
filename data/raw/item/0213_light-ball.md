## Identity & Utility
**Light Ball** is a **Species-Specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A mysterious and puzzling orb that vibrates with electrical energy. It is a **Held Item** designed exclusively for use by **Pikachu**. While it has a listed cost, it is rarely available in standard retail outlets, functioning as a specialized power-booster rather than a consumable medicine.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Relatively cheap, though its value lies in its rarity and specific effect rather than its resale price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Pikachu**, it **doubles** the holder's raw **Attack** and **Special Attack** stats during battle. This boost is applied to the initial stats, often making Pikachu hit harder than its evolved form, Raichu.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30.
    * **Fling Effect:** If used with the move Fling, the Light Ball will **guaranteed paralyze** the target (provided they are not immune to Electric-type status).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is the cornerstone of any offensive Pikachu set. In competitive formats (like Smogon or VGC), it transforms Pikachu into a "Glass Cannon"—offering immense wall-breaking power at the cost of extreme fragility, as it cannot hold defensive items like Eviolite or Focus Sash while using the Ball.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding:** If a Pikachu or Raichu holds a Light Ball while in the Pokémon Day Care/Nursery, the resulting **Pichu** Egg will hatch knowing the high-voltage physical move **Volt Tackle**, which is otherwise unattainable.
    * **Species Restriction:** This item provides no benefit to Raichu or Pichu in battle; the offensive doubling effect is exclusive to Pikachu and its various forms.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in the world as a hidden item in Power Plants or Forests, or obtained via specific event distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is famously found held by wild **Pikachu** (and its numerous variants including Cosplay Pikachu and Cap Pikachu). 
* **Farming Strategy:** Because the hold rate is typically low (5%), trainers often use a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability in the lead slot to increase the chance of wild Pikachu holding the item, combined with moves like **Thief** or **Covet** to retrieve it.
