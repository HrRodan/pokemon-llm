## Identity & Utility
**Stable Mulch** is a **Mulch** (Consumable Field Item) introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer used to augment the Berry-growing process. It is applied to soft soil patches before planting a seed. It is a consumable field item that is generally available for purchase in regions where Berry gardening is a prominent mechanic.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a patch of soil, it increases the longevity of a fully-grown Berry plant. Specifically, the plant will remain in its "Ripe" stage for **25% longer** than usual before the Berries wither, fall, and the plant potentially restarts its growth cycle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Mulch items are strictly for overworld utility. They cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and offer no tactical advantage in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its utility is restricted by regional soil types; notably, flavor text indicates it is incompatible with the soil in the **Hoenn** region (as seen in Gen VI and VII descriptions).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at specialized locations such as the **Flower Shop** in Floaroma Town (Sinnoh) or the **Berry Grocer** in Route 13 (Kalos). In games where Berry pots or dedicated soil patches exist, it is a staple for farmers looking to harvest at their own pace.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which are often gathered via the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters, Mulch must almost always be purchased or received from NPCs.
