## Identity & Utility
**TM197 (Dual Wingbeat)** is an **All-Machines** item (Technical Machine) introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)** via the *The Indigo Disk* DLC expansion.
* **Description:** A data-carrying disc used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX context, it teaches the move **Dual Wingbeat**. As a modern TM, it is a single-use consumable that is integrated into the TM Machine crafting system.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale for traditional currency; requires **League Points (LP)** and specific Pokémon materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dual Wingbeat** to a Pokémon. 
    * **Move Details:** Dual Wingbeat is a Physical Flying-type move with a Base Power of 40 that hits the target twice (totaling 80 power). It has an accuracy of 90%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be effectively used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Niche/Viable.** It is a staple for Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (such as Scizor), which boosts each hit's power by 50%. Its multi-strike nature is tactically significant for breaking **Focus Sashes**, the **Sturdy** ability, and bypassing **Substitute**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Unlike TMs in Generations V-VIII, this is consumed upon use but can be replicated if the player has the necessary materials.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy (*The Indigo Disk*). It can be found as a physical item on the ground in the Canyon Biome or unlocked for crafting at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To craft TM197, the player typically requires:
    * **League Points (LP)**
    * **Scyther Claws** (Dropped by the Scyther line)
    * **Rufflet Feathers** (Dropped by the Rufflet line)
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Its "farming" involves gathering the materials listed above from wild encounters to facilitate mass production at the TM Machine.
