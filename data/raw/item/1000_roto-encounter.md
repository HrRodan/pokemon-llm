## Identity & Utility
**Roto Encounter** is a **Rotom Power** (Consumable) introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A specialized power-up granted by the Rotom Dex. When activated from the bag, it significantly increases the likelihood of encountering high-level wild Pokémon in the area for a set duration. It is a **Consumable Overworld** item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation, it applies a temporary buff to the player that boosts the encounter rate of wild Pokémon at the higher end of the area's level range. This is particularly useful for training or searching for specific evolved forms in the wild.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item functions exclusively in the overworld to manipulate encounter RNG and provides no benefit in Trainer battles or competitive formats (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a member of the "Roto Loto" item family, similar to O-Powers from Generation VI, which are stored in the "Rotom Powers" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained through the **Roto Loto** feature in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*. Players earn a chance to spin the Roto Loto by interacting with the Rotom Dex on the lower screen when its eyes glow yellow.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is generated solely through the bond between the trainer and their Rotom Pokédex. 
* **Context:** In the Alola region, Roto Encounter serves as a quality-of-life tool for trainers looking to optimize their Pokédex completion or level up their team faster by targeting stronger wild encounters.
