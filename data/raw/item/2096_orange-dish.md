## Identity & Utility
**Orange Dish** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative dish used to customize the player's picnic set during the Picnic mechanic in the Paldea region. It is a **Cosmetic Key Item** that cannot be consumed or used in battle; its purpose is purely aesthetic, altering the visual appearance of the picnic table.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for Sale**). Items with a zero cost in this category are typically default options or acquired through specific NPC interactions rather than standard Mart purchases.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When setting up a Picnic, the player can select the Orange Dish to change the visual appearance of the tableware. It provides no mechanical bonuses to Meal Powers or Egg Power, acting strictly as a customization layer.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the overworld Picnic sub-game and has no impact on Smogon or VGC competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities. It is tied exclusively to the **Picnic** feature.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available as a starting customization option or obtained via **Picnic-Knacks** stores in major Paldean cities (such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, or Levincia) as part of a set. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a permanent addition to the player's picnic inventory once acquired.
