## Identity & Utility
**X Speed 2** is a **Miracle Shooter** battle item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An enhanced version of the standard X Speed. It is a consumable battle item that cannot be purchased with standard currency and cannot be used in the overworld. It is designed specifically for the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic in multiplayer Link Battles.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via point accumulation during battle).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a battle, it **sharply raises** the Speed stat of the active Pokémon by **two stages** (+100%). Like all stat-modifying items, the effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out of battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Legacy.** It is completely unavailable in standard competitive formats (Smogon or VGC) as it relies on the Gen V **Wonder Launcher** mechanic. Within that specific format, it is a high-value momentum-shifting item used to outspeed threats without spending multiple turns on setup moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on Pokémon evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz because it exists only within the Wonder Launcher interface during active combat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in Poké Marts or as hidden items in the overworld. It is exclusively available in **Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2** during Link Battles where the "Wonder Launcher" setting is enabled. Players must wait for their point gauge to fill during the match to "purchase" and use it instantly.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It cannot be farmed or transferred to other generations.
