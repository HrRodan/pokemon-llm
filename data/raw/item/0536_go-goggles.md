## Identity & Utility
**Go-Goggles** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A pair of specialized protective eyewear designed to shield a Trainer's eyes from harsh environmental hazards. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold. It functions as a permanent overworld utility once obtained, rather than a consumable or held item.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the Trainer the ability to traverse the intense sandstorm raging on **Hoenn Route 111**. Without this item, the player is physically pushed back and unable to explore the desert biome.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no mechanical impact on Pokémon battles or stats; its utility is strictly limited to overworld progression and story completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, it is the sole gatekeeper to the desert area, providing access to desert-dwelling species such as **Trapinch**, **Cacnea**, **Baltoy**, and the **Root/Claw Fossils** (Lileep/Anorith).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hoenn region games (*Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire*), the Go-Goggles are obtained as a story-mandated gift from the **Rival (May or Brendan)** after the player defeats Gym Leader Flannery and receives the Heat Badge.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique piece of equipment provided to the Trainer to facilitate travel through extreme weather conditions.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of a playthrough, the Go-Goggles represent a mid-game "lock-and-key" mechanic, signaling the transition from the volcanic region of Mt. Chimney to the arid eastern half of the Hoenn mainland.
