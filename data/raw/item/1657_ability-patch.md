## Identity & Utility
**Ability Patch** is a specialized Vitamin/Training item introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically during the *Crown Tundra* expansion of Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A high-tech patch that allows a Pokémon to transition from one of its standard Abilities to its **Hidden Ability** (referred to in-game as a "rare Ability"). It is a **Consumable** item used directly from the bag on a Pokémon in the party.
* **Cost:** 20 (Note: While the raw value is 20, this typically translates to **High-Value Specialized Currency** such as Dynite Ore in Galar or 125,000 Poke Dollars/LP in Paldea, making it an expensive end-game resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it permanently changes the Pokémon's current Ability to its **Hidden Ability**. 
    * *Generation VIII:* This was a one-way transformation (Standard to Hidden).
    * *Generation IX:* The mechanic was updated to allow the Ability Patch to toggle a Pokémon from its Hidden Ability back to its Standard Ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used effectively with the move Fling and is intended for out-of-battle optimization).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Essential.** This is one of the most significant "quality of life" items for high-level play. It allows players to optimize Rare/Shiny Pokémon or Legendaries that were caught with suboptimal standard abilities, making them viable for VGC and Smogon formats without the need for intensive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It has no effect on Pokémon that do not possess a Hidden Ability (e.g., Pokémon with only a single standard ability like Weezing or Eelektross).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Galar:** Purchased for 20 Dynite Ore at the Max Lair after completing Dynamax Adventures.
    * **Paldea:** Rarely rewarded for completing **6-Star and 7-Star Tera Raid Battles**, or occasionally available at the Porto Marinada auction.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial tool developed for advanced Pokémon training and is strictly obtained through high-level challenges or specialized vendors.
