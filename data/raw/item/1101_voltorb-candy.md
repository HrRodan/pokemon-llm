## Identity & Utility
**Voltorb Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy tailored to the Voltorb evolutionary line. When fed to a Voltorb or Electrode, it strengthens the Pokémon's overall power. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold but is typically acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than traditional shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Voltorb** or **Electrode**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 point**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and does not exist in games where the move Fling is standard for this item type).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the "Awakening Value" (AV) system of the *Let's Go* series. It is not used in standard VGC or Smogon formats (which use EVs/IVs). In its native games, it is essential for "maxing out" an Electrode to its highest possible stat ceiling (+200 to all stats).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the limitations of generic candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy) by boosting every attribute at once without being restricted by the Pokémon's current level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Let's Go versions) through the following methods:
    * **Catching:** Catching many Voltorb or Electrode in a row (Catch Combos).
    * **Transferring:** Sending Voltorb or Electrode to Professor Oak.
    * **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking a Voltorb or Electrode using the physical Poké Ball Plus peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. In the *Let's Go* series, wild Pokémon do not hold items; instead, players "farm" this candy by catching wild **Voltorb** and **Electrode** repeatedly (often found in the Power Plant).
