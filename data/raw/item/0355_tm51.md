## Identity & Utility
**TM51** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
*   **Description:** A data-encoding device used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. While the move contained within this TM varies by generation (notably teaching **Roost** in its debut and **Blizzard** in the Kanto remakes), it remains a permanent method of expanding a Pokémon's movepool.
*   **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches a compatible Pokémon a specific move. In its introductory context (Generation IV), it teaches **Roost**, a Flying-type recovery move.
*   **Move Profile (Roost):**
    *   **Effect:** Restores the user's HP by up to half of its max HP.
    *   **Hidden Mechanic:** If the user is a Flying-type, it loses its Flying-type resistances and weaknesses for the remainder of the turn (becoming grounded).
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** As **Roost**, this item is essential for the longevity of defensive "walls" and bulky attackers such as Corviknight, Skarmory, and Zapdos. In other iterations (like teaching **Blizzard**), it serves as a high-risk, high-reward offensive tool for Hail-based weather teams.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage was historically single-use (Gen 4) but became infinite-use starting in Gen 5, and craftable in Gen 9.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** In its debut (Sinnoh), it is obtained on **Route 210** from a bird keeper. In later generations, it is often available for purchase at Department Stores or via the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Most commonly acquired through world exploration or as a reward from Gym Leaders.
*   **Legacy:** TM51 is a prime example of move-index shifting. While its ID remains 355, the move it teaches has transitioned from **Roost** (Gens 4-6) to **Steel Wing** (Gen 7), **Blizzard** (LGPE), and **Sandstorm** (Gen 9), making it a highly versatile entry in a trainer's technical inventory.
