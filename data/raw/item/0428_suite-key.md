## Identity & Utility
**Suite Key** is a **Key Item** (categorized as an Event Item) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A specific key belonging to a luxury hotel suite at the Hotel Grand Lake (Valor Lakefront). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold; it is a quest-specific object intended for a one-time scripted event.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Opens the locked suite of an NPC at the Hotel Grand Lake near Lake Valor. Returning the key to its rightful owner allows the player to enter the room and receive a reward (typically a Lava Cookie in Diamond/Pearl or a White Flute in Platinum).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it exists solely for overworld quest progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Dowsing Machine** (Pokétch App), as the item is hidden and must be located using radar mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found at the **Valor Lakefront** in the Sinnoh region. It is located as a hidden item on the ground outside the Hotel Grand Lake entrance.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The flavor text notes that the key "often disappears," which is a nod to the NPC who frequently loses it, requiring the player's assistance. In the context of the Sinnoh games, this serves as a minor side-quest to introduce the player to the utility of the Dowsing Machine/Itemfinder.
