## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CNC3627** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, single-use consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon to appear as a raid boss until the end of the current day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Cheap; primarily used for internal game logic as the item is distributed via external codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) initiates a **Max Raid Battle**. Specifically, this crystal (CNC3627) is associated with the encounter for **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. The item itself has no utility in competitive battles; however, it is used to facilitate the capture of Pokémon with **Gigantamax factors**, high Individual Values (IVs), and Hidden Abilities, which are essential for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. Once the raid is defeated or the day ends, the effect expires and the item is consumed.
