## Identity & Utility
**Psychic Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized fragment of energy glowing with Psychic-type power. It is a **Consumable Exchange Item** used at the Treasure Eatery in Medali to alter the fundamental essence of a Pokémon. While it has a defined internal cost, it is primarily a gathered resource rather than a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Moderate value; typically sold rather than bought).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Psychic Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded to the chef at the Treasure Eatery in Medali to change a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to **Psychic**. This process is permanent until changed again by another set of shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Meta-Essential.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), Psychic Tera Shards are used to provide Pokémon with a Psychic Tera Type. This is often done defensively to resist Fighting and Psychic-type moves, or offensively to grant a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) boost to powerful Psychic moves like *Expanding Force* or *Stored Power*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts specifically with the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic. It is not affected by abilities like Pickup unless specified by modern generation drop tables.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Tera Raid Battles:** Primarily obtained as a reward for defeating Psychic-type Tera Raid bosses (3-star raids and higher).
    * **Exploration:** Occasionally found as hidden sparkling items on the ground throughout the Paldea region, particularly in high-level areas like **Area Zero**.
    * **Item Printer:** Can be produced randomly via the Item Printer in the Blueberry Academy (Indigo Disk DLC).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Gathering requires participating in the Paldean raid ecosystem or utilizing the **Pickup** ability in specific high-level level brackets in Gen IX.
* **Lore:** These shards are remnants of the energy released when a Terastalized Pokémon is defeated, condensing the Terastal energy of the Great Crater into physical form.
