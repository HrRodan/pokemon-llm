## Identity & Utility
**Leppa Berry** is a **Medicine (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A versatile berry that functions as both a manual medicine and a reactive held item. When a Pokémon's move reaches 0 PP, the berry is consumed to replenish energy. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be bought or grown.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores **10 PP** to a single move. If held in battle, it triggers automatically the moment a move's PP is fully depleted. If used from the bag, the trainer selects which move to restore.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Restores 10 PP to the target upon impact).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Steel-type** attack with **100 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally **Niche** in standard formats (VGC/Smogon) due to the short duration of matches. However, it is the cornerstone of "Infinite" strategies (e.g., Harvest + Recycle) and is **Essential** for PvE activities such as SOS Chaining, Shiny Hunting, and long-term grinding to avoid "Struggle" recoil.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Harvest** (allowing for infinite PP restoration) and **Recycle**. It is frequently used in "Leppa-Berry stalling" sets.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry trees across various regions or purchased at specialized Berry shops. In many games, it is a staple crop for Berry farming due to its utility in long routes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently carried by Pokémon known for their magical or elusive nature, specifically the **Clefairy line** (Cleffa, Clefairy, Clefable), the **Mr. Mime line** (Mime Jr., Mr. Mime), and the **Skitty line** (Skitty, Delcatty). It can be efficiently farmed using the **Thief** or **Covet** moves on these wild encounters.
