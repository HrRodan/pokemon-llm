## Identity & Utility
**Mankey Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized energy-dense treat used to bolster the growth of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought or sold for a nominal fee, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than traditional shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon in the **Mankey or Primeape** evolutionary line, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These gains are applied as **Awakened Values (AVs)**, which function as the statutory growth system in the *Let's Go* titles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held items are not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** This item is mandatory for "Max Stats" play within the *Let's Go* competitive meta. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats (Gen 8+), as the item does not exist in those games and the AV system is replaced by the traditional EV system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is exclusive to **Mankey** and **Primeape**. It does not trigger evolution but is the most efficient way to reach the 200 AV cap per stat compared to using generic candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not typically found in Poké Marts. It is primarily earned by:
    1. **Transferring:** Sending caught Mankey to Professor Oak.
    2. **Catch Combos:** Successfully chaining captures of wild Mankey.
    3. **Walking:** Using the Poké Ball Plus accessory to take a Mankey for a stroll in the real world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the "Catch Em All" gameplay loop, incentivizing the mass capture of the species to "grind" them into specialized empowerment tools.
