## Identity & Utility
**Fishing Rod (Galar)** is a **Gameplay / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized tool used to encounter wild Pokémon living in aquatic environments. Unlike previous regions that utilized a tiered system (Old, Good, and Super Rods), the Galar variant is a singular, multi-purpose tool. It is a **Key Item** that is **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a structural progression item provided to the player during the story.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player is near a body of water—specifically at designated "fishing spots" characterized by dark shadows or bubbling water—activating this item initiates a wild Pokémon encounter. In the Galar region, fishing is restricted to these specific interaction points rather than being usable on any water tile.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for collection, Nuzlocke encounters, and completing the Pokédex. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is the primary method for acquiring specific aquatic species like Magikarp, Arrokuda, and Feebas, which require specific methods (Leveling/Prism Scale) to evolve.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically obtained early in the game. In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, the player receives the Fishing Rod as a mandatory story item (typically associated with the arrival at Route 2 or the Professor's house), ensuring the player can access water-type encounters immediately.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool assigned to the Trainer. In Galar, the fishing mechanic is often paired with the **Rotom Bike** (Surfing Mood) to reach distant fishing spots in the Wild Area.
