## Identity & Utility
**TM224 (Curse)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: *The Indigo Disk* DLC).
* **Description:** A single-use device (in the Gen IX context) used to teach a Pokémon the move **Curse**. It represents a specialized utility tool for both setup sweepers and tactical Ghost-type strategies. It is a **Consumable** machine that **Cannot be bought** with standard currency; it must be crafted or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or synthesized at the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Curse** to a compatible Pokémon. The move functions differently based on the user's typing:
    * **Non-Ghost Types:** The user sacrifices one stage of Speed to increase its Attack and Defense by one stage each (a powerful "Bulky Setup" move).
    * **Ghost Types:** The user sacrifices 50% of its maximum HP to place a curse on the target, which reduces the target's HP by 1/4 of its maximum every turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be Flung in Generation IX, or have a base power of 10 with no added effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** Curse is a staple in competitive play. On bulky attackers (like Snorlax or Dondozo), the Attack/Defense boost is game-ending. On Ghost types (like Mimikyu or Dusclops), it serves as a "stall-breaker" or a way to force a switch/faint a Pokémon while safely bringing in a teammate.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, particularly those with high physical bulk or Ghost-type spectral origins.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Blueberry Academy Terarium** (The Indigo Disk). Once obtained, it can be replicated at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, crafting this TM typically requires:
    * **8,000 LP**
    * **3x Spiritomb Fragments**
    * **3x Mimikyu Scrap**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; however, the materials required to craft it are farmed from wild Ghost-type Pokémon found in the ruins and mountainous areas of Paldea and the Terarium.
