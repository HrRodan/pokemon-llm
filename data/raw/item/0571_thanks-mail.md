## Identity & Utility
**Thanks-Mail** is a **Mail (Stationery)** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery designed for trainers to express gratitude. It functions as a communication tool where a player composes a message from a predetermined list of phrases and attaches it to a Pokémon for delivery. It is a **Consumable/Held** item that is widely available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates player-to-player messaging. When given to a Pokémon, the trainer selects a message; upon trading, the recipient can read the message. Once read, the message can be erased to make the item reusable, or the Mail can be stored in the Trainer's PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Defensive Utility.** In a competitive battle context, Mail has a unique property: any move attempting to forcibly remove or swap the item (such as **Thief, Covet, Trick, or Switcheroo**) will automatically fail. While generally outclassed by items like Mega Stones or Z-Crystals in later generations, Mail was historically used to "item-lock" a Pokémon to prevent it from losing its held item or receiving a detrimental one (like a Choice Scarf).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While a Pokémon is holding Thanks-Mail, it **cannot be placed into a PC Box**. It must remain in the party until the Mail is removed. It does not trigger any evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at Pokémon Marts and specialized Stationery shops throughout the Unova region. Due to its low cost, it is intended for frequent social use.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon; it is an artificial consumer good. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Context:** Thanks-Mail is part of a thematic set of stationery (including BridgeMail, BloomMail, etc.) used to personalize trades. In the modern era of Pokémon, Mail has largely been phased out in favor of direct digital communication and simplified trading mechanics.
