## Identity & Utility
**Courage Candy L** is a **Vitamin (Stat Booster)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's Special Defense. It represents the middle tier of the "Courage" candy hierarchy (Standard < L < XL). It is a **Consumable** item that is used from the bag and cannot be held by Pokémon for use in battle.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap). While it has a low internal price, it is rarely purchased and is instead primarily acquired through gameplay loops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon’s **Special Defense Awakening Value (AV)** by 1. Unlike traditional Vitamins (like Zinc) that grant EVs, Courage Candies directly add to the stat total in the *Let's Go* engine.
* **Usage Requirement:** This specific "L" size variant can only be administered to Pokémon that have reached **Level 30 or higher**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is essential for competitive play within the *Let's Go* series to maximize a Pokémon's "Awakened" Special Defense. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats for Generations VIII and IX, as the Awakening system was replaced by the return of traditional EVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Courage" family, which correlates to the Special Defense stat (similar to how Health Candy correlates to HP).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Earned primarily by **transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak**. Sending him mid-to-high-level Pokémon or specific species that favor Special Defense (such as Tentacruel or Dewgong) frequently rewards the player with Courage Candy L. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Instead, it is often farmed via the **Catch Combo** mechanic; maintaining a high catch streak of Pokémon that yield Special Defense rewards will significantly increase the drop rate of Large Candies.
* **Lore Context:** These candies represent the bond between Trainer and Pokémon, distilled into energy that awakens a Pokémon's latent physical and mental potential.
