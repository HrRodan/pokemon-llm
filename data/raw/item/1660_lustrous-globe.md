## Identity & Utility
**Lustrous Globe** is a **Signature Forme-Change Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A glowing, radiant orb that radiates the power of space. It is a specialized **Key Item / Held Item** (depending on the game engine) specifically tied to the Legendary Pokémon **Palkia**. It represents the "Origin" counterpart to the traditional Lustrous Orb. It cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through special events or gameplay milestones).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on or held by **Palkia**, it triggers a transformation into **Palkia (Origin Forme)**. 
    * In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is used as a key item to toggle the form.
    * In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, it must be held by Palkia to maintain the Origin Forme.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Special items of this nature generally cannot be used with Fling, or have 0 power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Niche/Restricted).** Palkia-Origin is a dominant force in "Restricted" formats (Ubers/VGC Restricted). The Lustrous Globe is mandatory for this form, which grants Palkia a significant **Speed** increase (Base 100 to 120) at the cost of some Attack power, making it a more effective Special Sweeper than its standard form.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon; it is a **Forme-Change catalyst**. It is hard-coded to Palkia and has no effect on other species. It cannot be removed or stolen via *Knock Off* or *Thief* when held by the correct species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Legends: Arceus:** Obtained from Irida of the Pearl Clan after completing the main story and the "Massive Mass Outbreak" requests.
    * **Scarlet/Violet:** Obtainable via the **Porto Marinada auction** house, but only if the player has a Palkia in their party or boxes (typically transferred via Pokémon HOME).
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique artifact associated with the creation myth of the Sinnoh (Hisui) region and cannot be found on wild Pokémon. It is often gathered through narrative progression or special "Relic" auctions.
