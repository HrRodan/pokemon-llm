## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2421** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Token Cost**; this item is typically distributed via serial codes and is not available in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon use at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), a red beam is activated, spawning a specific Dynamax Pokémon encounter. The encounter remains active until 23:59 of the day it was activated or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating Max Raid Battles. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for providing early or guaranteed access to specific Pokémon with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanics of the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed as **promotional bonuses** (such as pre-order incentives, retail distributions like Best Buy or GameStop, or CoroCoro Comic inserts). The "Gem2421" designation corresponds to a specific internal ID for a unique encounter (often associated with rare Pokémon like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Duraludon depending on the specific event).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly external distribution item.
