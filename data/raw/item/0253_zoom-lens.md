## Identity & Utility
**Zoom Lens** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An optical lens designed to be held by a Pokémon. It functions by allowing the holder to observe the opponent's movements before striking, thereby increasing precision. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be bought for a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder moves **after** its target in a turn, the accuracy of its moves is increased by **20% (a 1.2x multiplier)**. 
    * *Note on Accuracy:* Unlike the *Wide Lens* (which provides a constant 1.1x boost), the Zoom Lens provides a higher bonus but requires the user to be slower than the opponent.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **niche competitive item**. It is most effective on naturally slow "tanky" Pokémon or those utilizing moves with high power but low accuracy (e.g., *Zap Cannon*, *Dynamic Punch*, *Sing*, or *Hydro Pump*). However, it is often overlooked in favor of the *Wide Lens* for consistency or *Life Orb* for raw damage.
    * **Bug/Error Note:** In its debut (Generation IV), the in-game flavor text incorrectly stated it boosted the critical-hit ratio. The actual mechanical effect has always been an accuracy boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a tactical tool for turn-order manipulation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through specialized vendors rather than standard Poké Marts. In its debut region (Sinnoh), it was notably available at the **Veilstone Game Corner**. In later generations, it is often found in **Battle Frontier** or **Battle Tree** shops in exchange for BP (Battle Points).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or found as a physical Poké Ball item on the ground in specific locations. It is not part of the common **Pickup** ability loot table.
