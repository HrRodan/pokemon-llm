## Identity & Utility
**Razor Fang** is a **Competitive Held Item** and **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A sharp, pointed fang that grants the holder a chance to intimidate opponents upon dealing damage. It is a dual-purpose item that functions as both a tactical battle tool and a specific catalyst for evolution. It is a holdable item that can be purchased in specific late-game locations.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive; often sold at Battle Facilities like the Battle Frontier or Battle Maison for BP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder successfully lands a damaging move that does not already have a flinch chance, there is an **11.7% (30/256) chance** that the target will flinch. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30. When used with the move **Fling**, the Razor Fang is consumed but **guarantees a flinch** on the target (provided they haven't moved yet).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. While the flinch chance is useful on Pokémon with high Speed or multi-hit moves (like Cloyster or Cinccino), it is often overshadowed by King's Rock (which has an identical effect). In competitive formats like Smogon or VGC, it is used primarily to cheese wins through RNG or in specific "Fling" strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Species Evolution:** It is the mandatory held item for **Gligar** to evolve into **Gliscor**. The evolution is triggered when Gligar levels up during the **Night** while holding this item.
    * **Ability Interaction:** This item does not stack with moves that already have a flinch chance and is negated by the ability **Klutz**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game areas or purchased at Battle Parks, Battle Subways, or Battle Trees for 48 BP. In some regions, it is found as a hidden item in jagged, rocky terrain.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is rarely found in the wild (5% chance) held by **Bruxish**. Trainers often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the find rate or **Frisk/Covet** to farm the item for Gligar evolution.
