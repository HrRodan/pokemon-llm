## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Sparks** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a bundle of residual electrical energy left behind by a Rotom. It is a **Consumable Crafting Reagent** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. It is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold, its primary value lies in its use as currency for move-learning.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldean ecosystem, it is combined with League Points (LP) to create powerful Electric and Ghost-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is **essential for competitive preparation**. It is required to craft staple competitive TMs such as **TM048 (Volt Switch)**, **TM096 (Eerie Impulse)**, and **TM161 (Trick)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching wild Rotom. It is found in areas where Rotom frequent, such as the lighthouse near Porto Marinada or near electrical substations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held but dropped upon a successful encounter with wild **Rotom**. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is a guaranteed drop from its specific evolutionary line, making "Rotom farming" a common late-game activity for players looking to optimize their movepools.
