## Identity & Utility
**Razz Berry** is a **Baking/Ingredient Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** Primarily utilized as a culinary ingredient rather than a medicinal tool. It is famously used to craft **PokéBlocks** in Hoenn and **Poffins** in Sinnoh to improve a Pokémon's "Cool" condition for Contests. It is a **Consumable** item that **can** be bought in specific berry outlets.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the core series games, this berry has **no direct effect** when consumed in battle. Its utility is strictly limited to planting/harvesting and cooking. In the *Let's Go* series and *Pokémon GO*, however, it is a vital tool used to make wild Pokémon easier to catch.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fire-type** attack with **80 Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It holds no strategic value in VGC or Smogon formats as it provides no recovery, stat boosts, or damage mitigation. It is considered a "Flavor/Contest" item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a primary source of "Spicy" flavors for high-level PokéBlock/Poffin crafting.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in the overworld on Berry trees/soil patches. It can be purchased from the Berry Master or specialized flower shops (like the Pretty Petal Flower Shop).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon in the core RPGs; it is primarily gathered via **planting and harvesting** cycles. In the wild, it is considered one of the most common and easily renewable resources for trainers.
* **Lore Context:** The Razz Berry is characterized by its vivid red color and its popularity among Sinnoh residents for creating sweets. Its spicy profile makes it a favorite for trainers aiming to win the **Coolness** category of Pokémon Contests.
