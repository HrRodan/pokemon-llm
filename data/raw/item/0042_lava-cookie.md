## Identity & Utility
**Lava Cookie** is a **Status-cure Medicine** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** Known as Lavaridge Town’s local specialty, it is a gourmet consumable used to treat Pokémon. It functions as a **Consumable** item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. Unlike basic medicines, it is a "Specialty" item—a thematic equivalent to the Full Heal.
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). It is notably more affordable than a standard Full Heal (600 Poké Dollars), making it a high-value alternative for resource-conscious trainers.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon, it **cures all status ailments** (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) and also removes **Confusion**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional effect when flung beyond base damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in **Story Playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**. In competitive PvP (VGC/Smogon), manual status-cure items are rarely used as they consume a turn; players instead prefer the **Lum Berry**, which provides the same effect automatically upon being statused.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is part of the "Regional Specialty" item group (alongside the Old Gateau, Casteliacone, and Big Malasada). While it does not trigger evolution, it is a favorite for increasing friendship in certain game iterations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally exclusive to the **Lavaridge Town** specialty shop in the Hoenn region. In later generations, it is often available via specialized vending machines, or as prizes in Battle Facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a common reward found by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability in mid-to-high level tiers, representing the Pokémon "finding" discarded snacks or regional treats.
