## Identity & Utility
**TM90** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding device used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. While Technical Machines were historically single-use consumables, they transitioned to infinite-use items in Generation V through VII, before returning to a craftable/consumable format in Generation IX.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its status as a high-tier tactical move, often found in late-game Department Stores or obtained via high-effort exchanges (like Game Corners).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Substitute** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * *Note on Data Discrepancy:* While the core effect entry identifies this as Substitute, the Gen 8 flavor text refers to **Electric Terrain**. In the Galar region (Sword/Shield), TM numbering was reassigned, but the item ID 394 historically represents the Substitute TM.
* **Move Mechanics (Substitute):** The user sacrifices 25% of its maximum HP to create a decoy. This decoy protects the user from direct damage and most status conditions until it is destroyed by an opponent's attack.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have a base power of 0-30 depending on the specific game engine).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Substitute is a fundamental move in competitive play (Smogon and VGC). It is used to:
        * Protect sweepers from status moves (like Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave).
        * Ease prediction against switching opponents.
        * Activate HP-dependent abilities or items (like Torrent, Blaze, or Salac Berries).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a vast majority of Pokémon, as almost every Pokémon that can learn TMs can learn Substitute.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available for purchase in major Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City, Shopping Mall Nine) or as a prize in the Global Terminal/Game Corner. In recent generations, it can be found in the overworld in secluded areas (like the Wild Area or specialized caves).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial human-made tool. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, making the 20,000 cost a fixed barrier for acquisition.
* **Regional Context:** In its debut region (Sinnoh), it was a highly coveted prize, representing one of the most flexible defensive tools in a trainer's arsenal.
