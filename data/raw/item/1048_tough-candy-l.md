## Identity & Utility
**Tough Candy L** is a **Vitamin (Stat Booster)** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy designed to bolster a Pokémon's physical resilience. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used from the bag on any Pokémon that has reached **Level 30 or higher**. Unlike traditional vitamins that have a cap (e.g., Iron), this item contributes to the unique "Awakened Value" (AV) system.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently increases a Pokémon's **Defense stat** by 1 point (in the form of Awakened Values). It is the second tier of the "Tough Candy" family, specifically gated by the Pokémon's level to ensure mid-to-late game progression.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats (which use EVs/IVs), but essential for "No Restrictions" or "Master Trainer" battles within its native games to reach the +200 stat cap.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used to optimize a Pokémon's "Toughness" profile for the endgame.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee!*, these are primarily acquired by catching Defense-oriented Pokémon (like Geodude or Onix) or by transferring large quantities of Pokémon to Professor Oak. It can also be obtained via the Poké Ball Plus "Stroll" feature.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the "Catch Combo" mechanic, where catching the same species repeatedly increases the yield of specialized candies. It serves as a core part of the "Professor Oak's Lab" recycling loop.
