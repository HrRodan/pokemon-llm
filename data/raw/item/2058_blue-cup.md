## Identity & Utility
**Blue Cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative dish used to customize the player's picnic set. It is a **Consumable (Cosmetic)** item that can be purchased and swapped out to change the visual theme of the picnic table during social gameplay and sandwich making.
* **Cost:** 1,500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When selected in the picnic customization menu, the Blue Cup replaces the default cups on the picnic table. This change is purely aesthetic and persists as long as the item is equipped to the picnic set.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on stats, typing, or move effectiveness. It is strictly a "flavor" item for the overworld picnic mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. It is categorized under the "Picnic" sub-set of items, similar to tablecloths and water bottles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Picnic Knacks** specialty shops throughout the Paldea region (found in major hubs such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It must be purchased through standard retail outlets.
* **Context:** In the Paldean culture of Generation IX, picnics are the primary method for bonding with Pokémon and breeding (obtaining Eggs). The Blue Cup serves as a minor collectible for players looking to complete their set of camping equipment.
