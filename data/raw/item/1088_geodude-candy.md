## Identity & Utility
**Geodude Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable growth item packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically to the Geodude evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily obtained through gameplay loops rather than traditional shop purchases.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal sell value, its true worth lies in its stat-boosting properties.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Geodude family, it increases **all of the Pokémon's stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a mechanic unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held item mechanics are not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* ecosystem. In "No-Restrictions" battles within those games, Geodude Candy is essential for reaching the maximum cap of 200 AVs in every stat, making a Pokémon significantly more powerful than its base version. It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats from Generation VIII onwards.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically works for **Geodude**, **Graveler**, and **Golem**. Notably, it applies to both the standard **Kanto forms** and the **Alolan forms** of these Pokémon. It does not trigger evolution but optimizes the Pokémon for high-level encounters and Master Trainers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item cannot be consistently bought at Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired by:
    1.  **Transferring:** Sending caught Geodude, Graveler, or Golem to Professor Oak.
    2.  **Catch Combos:** Successfully chaining captures of wild Geodude or its evolutions.
    3.  **Stroll:** Taking a Pokémon for a stroll in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item in the wild (as wild hold mechanics are absent in *Let's Go*). Instead, it is a reward for the "farming" process of repeatedly catching the same species, representing the "essence" of the Geodude line.
