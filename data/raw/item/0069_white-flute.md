## Identity & Utility
**White Flute** is a **Spelunking** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A flute crafted from white glass (traditionally made from volcanic ash). It is a **Consumable** and **Holdable** item that is primarily **usable in the overworld** to influence wild Pokémon behavior. Unlike its counterparts in its debut generation, modern iterations are treated as low-cost consumables.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the overworld, it **doubles the wild Pokémon encounter rate**, making it significantly easier to trigger battles in tall grass, caves, or water. 
    * *Note on Mechanical Evolution:* While early generations used this to double encounter rates, later flavor text and data (Gen VI+) suggest it makes it easier to encounter "weak" Pokémon specifically, effectively serving as the mechanical opposite of the Black Flute.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages in a battle setting. It is strictly a utility tool for playthrough efficiency, grinding, or shiny hunting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It is categorized under "Spelunking," placing it alongside items like Repels and Escape Ropes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its original Hoenn context, the White Flute was a specialized item obtained from the **Glass Workshop on Route 113** in exchange for 1,000 steps worth of gathered volcanic ash. In later regions, it is occasionally available for purchase at specialized marts or found within cave systems.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held** by wild Pokémon. It must be crafted, found as floor loot in "spelunking" environments, or purchased from specific vendors. It is not part of the **Pickup** ability table.
