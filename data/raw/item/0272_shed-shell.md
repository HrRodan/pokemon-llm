## Identity & Utility
**Shed Shell** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A tough, discarded carapace that functions as a tactical escape tool. It is a permanent **Held Item** that can be bought or found in the overworld. Unlike consumable berries, it remains equipped after use.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The holder is granted immunity to all trapping effects. This allows the Pokémon to switch out even when under the influence of trapping abilities (such as **Shadow Tag**, **Arena Trap**, or **Magnet Pull**) or trapping moves (such as **Mean Look**, **Block**, or **Spider Web**). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **high-tier niche utility item**. It is primarily used on defensive walls (like Skarmory, Toxapex, or Ferrothorn) to prevent them from being "trapped and removed" by specific counters (e.g., Skarmory escaping a Magnet Pull Magnezone). It is a vital counter-measure in metagames where trapping abilities are prevalent.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is a passive "holdable-active" item that functions continuously as long as it is held and the holder's ability is not suppressed (e.g., by Neutralizing Gas).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in mid-to-late game areas, often near forests or locations with buggy/insectoid themes. It can also be purchased at specific late-game Pokémon Marts or Battle Frontier shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is notably farmed from wild Pokémon that shed skins or carapaces. It can be found on:
    * **Venomoth**, **Beautifly**, **Dustox**, and **Seviper**.
    * **Scraggy** and **Scrafty**.
    * **Goomy** and **Sliggoo**.
    * *Trainer Tip:* Using a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability in the lead slot increases the chance of encountering wild Pokémon holding this item, which can then be taken using **Thief** or **Covet**.
