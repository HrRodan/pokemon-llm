## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (eri984)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, single-use event item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Placeholder cost; typically distributed via serial codes or pre-order bonuses).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone den in the Galar Wild Area), it forces a specific Max Raid encounter to spawn. The encounter remains active until the end of the calendar day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for facilitating PvE (Player vs. Environment) encounters. It is used by collectors and competitive players only to acquire specific Pokémon, often with guaranteed high individual values (IVs) or Hidden Abilities, which are standard for Raid bosses.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Den Trigger" mechanic specific to the Dynamax phenomenon in Galar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in Pokémon Marts. It was distributed as a **Limited-Time Serial Code** reward (often associated with retail promotions or pre-order bonuses like the Dual Pack or specific guidebooks). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended to bridge the gap between real-world promotions and in-game encounters.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals are highly concentrated forms of Galar Particles that can summon specific Dynamax entities to otherwise dormant Power Spots.
