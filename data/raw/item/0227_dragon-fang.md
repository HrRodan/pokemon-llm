## Identity & Utility
**Dragon Fang** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A hard and sharp tooth that serves as a specialized power-booster for Dragon-type Pokémon. It is a **Held-Active** item that provides a passive offensive buff during battle. Unlike many evolution items, it is not consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Accessible**). While the monetary value is low, its availability is typically restricted to late-game locations or rare wild encounters.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the base power of the holder's **Dragon-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Moderate physical damage when thrown via the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **niche offensive item**. While items like *Life Orb* provide a higher boost (30%) to all moves at the cost of HP, or *Choice* items provide 50% at the cost of move flexibility, the Dragon Fang is used when a trainer wants to boost a Dragon-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move without negative drawbacks. It is often seen in "Item Clause" formats where other top-tier items are already assigned to teammates.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is purely a combat-enhancement tool. It interacts normally with abilities like **Klutz** (which prevents its use) and **Sticky Hold** (which prevents its theft).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in locations associated with Dragon-type trainers or legendary dragons, such as the Dragon's Den, Meteor Falls, or Dragonspiral Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is a signature loot piece for the Dragon type. It can be farmed from wild **Dragonair**, **Dragonite**, **Bagon**, **Shelgon**, **Salamence**, and **Druddigon**. Utilizing a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase hold rates) and the move **Thief** or the ability **Frisk** is the most efficient way to acquire multiple fangs.
