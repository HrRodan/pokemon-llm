## Identity & Utility
**TM64 (Explosion)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide a Pokémon with the move **Explosion**. It is a **Consumable/Multi-use Teaching Item** (depending on the generation) that can be bought or found. While the move has existed since Gen I, its designation as TM64 became standard starting in the Sinnoh region.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Explosion** to a compatible Pokémon. Explosion is a high-risk, high-reward Normal-type physical move where the user attacks all surrounding targets with massive power (250 Base Power in modern generations) and then immediately faints.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard for most Technical Machines).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** Historically, Explosion was a top-tier threat in Gen 4 because it halved the opponent's Defense during calculation. In modern competitive play (VGC/Smogon), it is used on "Suicide Leads" or "Wallbreakers" to deal massive damage and provide a "safe switch" for a teammate. It is hard-countered by the ability **Damp** and Ghost-type Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, the move it teaches interacts uniquely with abilities: **Damp** prevents its use entirely, while **Galvanize**, **Refrigerate**, and **Pixilate** can change the move's type (to Electric, Ice, or Fairy, respectively) and increase its damage output significantly.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Throughout the series, TM64 is often found in high-security or late-game areas, such as the **Veilstone Game Corner** (Gen IV), **Route 10** (Gen V), or the **Team Flare Secret HQ** (Gen VI). In the most recent regions like Paldea (*Scarlet/Violet*), it can be crafted at a TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It must be found as a Poké Ball item on the ground, received from an NPC, or purchased from specialized vendors like Department Stores or the TM Machine.
