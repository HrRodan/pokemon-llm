## Identity & Utility
**Helix Fossil** is a **Dex-Completion (Fossil)** item introduced in **Generation I** (with its metadata here reflecting its integration into the **Generation IV** Sinnoh engine).
* **Description:** A petrified remain of a prehistoric sea-dwelling Pokémon. It is a **Consumable/Exchange** item that is primarily used to obtain extinct species. While it has a high internal price, it is traditionally found through exploration rather than purchased at a standard Mart.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Selling it is generally discouraged as fossils are rare and required for Pokédex completion.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Helix Fossil can be taken to specific research facilities—such as the **Cinnabar Lab** in Kanto, the **Mining Museum** in Oreburgh City, or the **Museum of Science** in Pewter City—to be regenerated into the Rock/Water-type Pokémon **Omanyte** at Level 5, 15, or 20 (depending on the game version).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100. This is a remarkably high base power for the move **Fling**, making it a heavy projectile, though using it consumes the fossil and prevents revival.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. However, its revival result, **Omastar**, is a notable niche threat in lower competitive tiers (Smogon) or specific VGC formats due to its access to **Shell Smash**, **Swift Swim**, and high Special Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the sole precursor to the Omanyte family. In the Sinnoh region (Gen IV), its presence is flagged with the **Underground** attribute, meaning it is primarily obtained through the Subterranean mining minigame.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Kanto:** A choice between the Helix and Dome Fossil at the end of **Mt. Moon**.
    * **Sinnoh:** Rare loot found by digging in the **Grand Underground** (Availability often depends on the Trainer ID or version, specifically appearing more frequently in *Pokémon Shining Pearl* or specific Gen IV versions).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "buried treasure" and is most commonly gathered via **Mining** or **Rock Smash**. 
* **Cultural Note:** Within the Pokémon community, the Helix Fossil gained "Legendary" status following the *Twitch Plays Pokémon* phenomenon, where it became an object of ironic worship ("Lord Helix"), further cementing its status as one of the most iconic items in the franchise.
