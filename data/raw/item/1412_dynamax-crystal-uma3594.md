## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA3594** is a **Dynamax-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically priced as **Cheap**, but effectively priceless as it is an event-exclusive distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, this crystal forces a Max Raid Battle to spawn. This raid persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which pull from a generic den pool, this crystal guarantees a specific encounter (often a Pokémon with its Hidden Ability or a Gigantamax-capable form).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer-vs-Trainer battles (VGC/Smogon). Its value is entirely within the PvE (Player vs. Environment) loop for obtaining Rare Pokémon for a competitive roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are promotional items typically distributed via **Serial Codes** from retail partners (such as GameStop, Target, or Pokémon Center) or as bonuses for purchasing specific DLC bundles or Japanese magazine expansions (like *CoroCoro*).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a "Special Acquisition" item.
* **Context:** In the lore of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, these crystals contain a concentrated burst of Galar Particles, allowing a Trainer to manifest a specific Dynamax phenomenon at a dormant Power Spot.
