## Identity & Utility
**Solganium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** This item is the bag-stored version of the Solganium Z crystal. It is used to upgrade Solgaleo’s signature move, Sunsteel Strike, into a more powerful exclusive Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Item-adjacent Held Item** that is **not consumable** and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique plot/event acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Solgaleo** or **Dusk Mane Necrozma** that knows the move **Sunsteel Strike**, it allows the Pokémon to perform the exclusive Z-Move: **Searing Sunraze Smash**.
    * **Move Details:** Searing Sunraze Smash is a Physical Steel-type move with **200 Base Power**. Like the base move, it ignores the target's Ability (e.g., Sturdy, Multiscale, or Unaware).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed from the holder by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for Solgaleo and Dusk Mane Necrozma in Generation VII Ubers. It provides a massive one-time nuke that bypasses defensive abilities, allowing these Pokémon to OHKO or severely weaken threats that rely on damage reduction.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally tied to the **Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring** mechanic and requires the trainer to possess the corresponding bracelet to activate.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun*, it is obtained at Mahalo Trail after the player assists Lillie and Solgaleo. In *Pokémon Ultra Moon*, it is obtained alongside the Solgaleo/Dusk Mane Necrozma storyline. It is categorized as "unused" or a "bag item" in certain database contexts to differentiate the inventory icon from the active held item state.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact associated with the Legendary "Beast that devours the sun." It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
