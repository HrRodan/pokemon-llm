## Identity & Utility
**Cacnea Needle** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A biological byproduct dropped by the Cacnea evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly from the bag or held by a Pokémon in battle. It is primarily managed via the "TM Materials" pocket of the inventory.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Common**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at a Pokémon Center's TMM hub. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it has no **Fling** utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held. Its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle "move acquisition" economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution or interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is strictly a currency-adjacent crafting reagent.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the **Cacnea** family.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop awarded to the player upon the conclusion of an encounter with:
    * **Cacnea**
    * **Cacturne**
* **Usage Context:** In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, Cacnea Needles are required to craft specific TMs that align with the Pokémon's thematic moveset, most notably **TM090 (Spikes)** and **TM051 (Sandstorm)**. This reflects the biological traits of the Cacnea line, which are desert-dwelling, needle-covered organisms.
