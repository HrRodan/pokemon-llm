## Identity & Utility
**Nest Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized capture tool designed for catching weaker or lower-level wild Pokémon. It is a **consumable** item used during encounters and can be held by Pokémon, though it provides no passive benefit in battle.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Specialty Ball cost**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates the capture of wild Pokémon with a success rate inversely proportional to the target's level. The catch rate multiplier is calculated using the formula: `(40 - target_level) / 10`.
    * **Maximum Efficiency:** 3.9× catch rate for Level 1 Pokémon.
    * **Diminishing Returns:** The multiplier decreases as the level increases.
    * **Minimum Efficiency:** At Level 30 and above, the catch rate defaults to 1.0× (equivalent to a standard Poké Ball).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used effectively with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily a **utility tool** for Pokédex completion and shiny hunting. In competitive settings, its value is purely **aesthetic**, providing a green-and-tan "nest" animation when a Pokémon is sent out.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with specific abilities. Like all Poké Balls, it is consumed upon use regardless of whether the capture is successful.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at Pokémon Centers and specialized Poké Marts (such as those in Verdanturf Town in Hoenn or late-game shops in other regions). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or found as overworld loot.
* **Context:** The Nest Ball is ideal for trainers returning to early-game routes to catch Pokémon they missed, or for higher-level trainers looking to catch low-level Pokémon for breeding purposes without accidentally knocking them out. Within the "Specialty Ball" hierarchy, it serves a niche opposite to the **Ultra Ball** (which is better for high-level targets) and the **Dusk Ball** (which is environment-dependent).
