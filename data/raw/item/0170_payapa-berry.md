## Identity & Utility
**Payapa Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable berry that provides a one-time defensive buffer against Psychic-type threats. It is a **holdable-active** item designed for strategic mid-battle consumption.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily acquired through cultivation or foraging).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a **super-effective Psychic-type attack**, the berry is consumed to **halve the damage** taken from that hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; provides no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** If used with the move Natural Gift, this berry transforms into a **Psychic-type** attack with **80 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Niche Defensive Staple**. It is often utilized in VGC (Doubles) and Smogon formats on Pokémon weak to Psychic-type coverage (such as **Toxapex**, **Amoonguss**, or **Kommo-o**) to survive powerful hits like *Expanding Force* or *Psycho Boost*. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with the **Harvest** ability for infinite recovery, the **Ripen** ability (which would theoretically reduce damage by 75%), and is negated by the **Unnerve** or **Cheek Pouch** abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on berry trees throughout the Sinnoh, Kalos, and Alola regions. In most games, it must be grown from a single specimen to accumulate a larger supply.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Mankey** and **Primeape** (5% chance). These can be farmed using moves like **Thief**, **Covet**, or the **Frisk** ability to identify holders.
