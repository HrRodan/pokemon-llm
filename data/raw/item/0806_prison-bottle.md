## Identity & Utility
**Prison Bottle** is a **Gameplay / Key Item** introduced in Generation VI (first appearing in *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*) and present in subsequent generations including Generation VII.
* **Description:** A mysterious, ornate bottle believed to have been used to seal away the true power of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa centuries ago. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a **Hoopa (Confined)** in the player's party, it transforms it into **Hoopa Unbound**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Essential for unlocking Hoopa Unbound. Hoopa Unbound is a premier wallbreaker in competitive formats (like Smogon’s UU or Ubers, depending on the generation) due to its massive Attack and Special Attack stats and its signature move, *Hyperspace Fury*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Form Reversion:** In earlier generations (Gen VI–VII), Hoopa reverts to its Confined form after three days pass or if it is deposited into the PC. In later generations (Gen VIII–IX), the bottle can be used again to manually revert the form.
    * **Restriction:** Hoopa Unbound cannot use its signature move *Hyperspace Fury* if it is not in its Unbound form.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained through a special event trigger. In most games (*ORAS, Sun/Moon, Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*), the player must have a Hoopa in their party and speak to a specific NPC (often a Poké Mart clerk) to receive the bottle. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact tied to the Hoopa mythos.
* **Lore context:** The bottle was created by a traveler to suppress Hoopa's destructive "Unbound" power after it caused chaos in a desert town. Only by "opening" the bottle can Hoopa temporarily reclaim its original strength.
