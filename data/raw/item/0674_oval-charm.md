## Identity & Utility
**Oval Charm** is a **Gameplay Enhancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, oval-shaped charm that facilitates the discovery of Pokémon Eggs. It is a permanent **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, held by a Pokémon in battle, or sold at Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Significantly increases the efficiency of the Pokémon Day Care (or Nursery). Every 255 steps taken by the player, the game performs a check to see if an Egg has been produced; the Oval Charm **doubles the base probability** of an Egg being generated during these checks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no utility within a battle, it is considered a **Breeder’s Staple**. It is essential for competitive players and "Shiny Hunters" to reduce the time spent cycling to generate Eggs for IV breeding, Nature synchronization, and Masuda Method hunting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Day Care/Nursery mechanics**, affecting the rate at which the "Day Care Man" or "Nursery Aide" discovers an Egg.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Oval Charm is typically awarded as a milestone achievement for Pokédex completion. In its debut (Black 2/White 2), it is given by Professor Juniper after the player has **seen** every Pokémon in the Regional Pokédex. In subsequent generations, it is often awarded by Game Freak NPCs or Professors for similar feats of exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item that persists in the player's "Key Items" pocket.
* **Context:** The item represents the player's mastery of a region's ecology, granted only to those who have thoroughly documented the local fauna, thereby granting them deeper insight into Pokémon biology and breeding habits.
