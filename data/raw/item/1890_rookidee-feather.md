## Identity & Utility
**Rookidee Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A shed feather from the Rookidee evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting component used exclusively at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for League Points (LP) or Poké Dollars, though it is primarily kept for move-teaching utility.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Fodder**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Within the Paldean crafting system, it is typically required for Flying-type or bird-related moves. Specifically, it is used to craft:
    * **TM040 (Air Cutter)**
    * **TM113 (Tailwind)**
    * **TM164 (Brave Bird)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard for TM materials; they cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on battle stats or mechanics. Its value is strictly "Meta-Competitive," as it is required to teach high-tier moves like *Tailwind* or *Brave Bird* to a team before entering a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching members of the Rookidee evolutionary line in the wild. It is also a common reward from **Auto-Battles** (Let's Go! feature).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is dropped by:
    * **Rookidee**
    * **Corvisquire**
    * **Corviknight**
* **Context:** In the Paldean economy, trainers often farm these feathers in the early-game areas (like South Province) to stock up on utility moves like *Tailwind*, which is a staple in VGC (Video Game Championships) for speed control.
