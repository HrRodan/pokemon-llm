## Identity & Utility
**Devon Parts** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (though indexed in Generation VII within this data).
* **Description:** A specialized case containing mechanical components manufactured by the Devon Corporation. As a Key Item, it is essential for story progression and is held in a separate pocket of the Bag. It cannot be sold, discarded, or given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a critical quest objective. The player must deliver the parts to **Captain Stern** in Slateport City. Successfully delivering the item allows Captain Stern to proceed with his undersea expedition and triggers the next phase of the regional narrative.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for the "overworld" plot and has no utility in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger Pokémon evolution. It interacts exclusively with NPCs (specifically Captain Stern and the Devon researcher) to advance the game's script.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as part of the main storyline. The player recovers the stolen parts from a **Team Aqua or Team Magma Grunt** (depending on the version) within the **Rusturf Tunnel** after rescuing Peeko the Wingull.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological asset central to the conflict between the Devon Corporation and the local villainous teams in the Hoenn region. 
* **Lore Context:** The Devon Parts are intended for a high-tech submarine being constructed by Captain Stern. Their theft highlights the industrial espionage themes prevalent in the Hoenn-based games (*Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby,* and *Alpha Sapphire*).
