## Identity & Utility
**TR51 (Dragon Dance)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** TR51 is a single-use teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Dragon Dance**. Unlike the infinite-use TMs of the same generation, TRs are consumed upon use, functioning similarly to classic TMs from earlier generations. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that can be acquired through specialized currency or Raid activities.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Special Acquisition**). In its debut region, it is often exchanged for Watts (W) rather than standard currency at Wild Area Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Dance** to a compatible Pokémon. Dragon Dance is a non-damaging Dragon-type status move that **raises the user's Attack and Speed stats by one stage each (+1).**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low utility; teaching the move is vastly more valuable than using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/Core Staple.** Dragon Dance is widely considered one of the best setup moves in competitive Pokémon history (Singles and VGC). It allows physical "sweepers" to simultaneously increase their damage output and overcome their Speed tiers, often allowing a single Pokémon to win a match if given one turn to set up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is highly sought after for physical powerhouses such as **Dragonite, Gyarados, Tyranitar, and Roaring Moon** to maximize their offensive potential.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR51 is primarily obtained by defeating **Dragon-type Pokémon in Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 2,000 Watts (its inventory rotates daily).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured record of the move's data. Its presence in Galar represents a shift where powerful, high-tier moves were gated behind the "Technical Record" system to encourage exploration and Raid participation.
