## Identity & Utility
**TR36 (Heat Wave)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use teaching device that instructs a compatible Pokémon in the move **Heat Wave**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, which are infinite, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a mechanic similar to classic TMs from earlier generations. It is a high-value teaching tool for Fire-type special offense.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value**). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded using Watts (W) in its debut region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Heat Wave** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Heat Wave is a Fire-type Special attack with **95 Base Power** and **90% Accuracy**. It targets all adjacent opponents (spread damage) and has a **10% chance to burn** each target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 95 (Significant damage when used with the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Essential.** Heat Wave is a staple move in **VGC (Doubles)** because it allows Pokémon like Charizard, Torkoal, and Zapdos to damage both opponents simultaneously without hitting their ally. In Smogon/Singles, it serves as a reliable high-power Fire coverage move for Flying and Psychic types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching resource for specially-oriented attackers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR36 is primarily acquired from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price (usually around 3,000–5,000 Watts). It is also a frequent reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** against Fire-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial data record manufactured for Galar trainers to expand their Pokémon’s move pools through Max Raid participation.
