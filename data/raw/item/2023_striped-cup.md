## Identity & Utility
**Striped Cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative cup used to customize the player's picnic set. It is a **consumable customization item** that can be purchased and used to change the visual theme of the picnic table during the picnic mini-game.
* **Cost:** 800 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When selected in the picnic customization menu, it replaces the default cups on the picnic table with a striped-pattern variant. This effect is purely cosmetic and does not influence the **Meal Powers** or sandwich results.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a flavor/lifestyle item intended for the overworld picnic mechanic and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution for any Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily in the Paldea region. It is sold at **Picnic-Knacks** specialty stores located in major hubs such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or battle items, it must be purchased from retail outlets specializing in outdoor gear.
