## Identity & Utility
**TM63** is a **Technical Machine** (Teaching Tool) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Embargo**. It is a **Consumable** (in early and the most recent generations) or **Infinite-use** (Gens V-VIII) item that is used to expand a Pokémon's tactical movepool.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). This high price point typically classifies it as a high-tier utility move found in major Department Stores or late-game TM shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Embargo**. This move prevents the target Pokémon from utilizing its held item for five turns. Additionally, in Trainer battles, it prevents the opposing Trainer from using items (such as Hyper Potions or Full Restores) on that specific Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be utilized with the move Fling for damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Tactical.** Embargo is a disruption move. In competitive play (Smogon/VGC), it is rarely used because the move **Knock Off** is generally superior, as it removes the item permanently while dealing damage. However, Embargo can be used to temporarily neutralize items that cannot be removed (like certain Mega Stones or Z-Crystals in older formats) or to shut down **Eviolite** and **Choice** item users.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily compatible with **Dark**, **Ghost**, and certain **Psychic-type** Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM63 has a widespread presence across almost every region from Sinnoh to Paldea. It is frequently obtained in urban settings or "shady" areas (e.g., Veilstone City, Nimbasa City, or via the TM Machine in Gen IX). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased, found as a field item (Poké Ball on the ground), or received from an NPC.
* **Legacy:** While its utility has fluctuated, its high cost in the data reflects its status as a "luxury" disruption tool often gated behind high-tier Marts.
