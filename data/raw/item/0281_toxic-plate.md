## Identity & Utility
**Toxic Plate** is a specialized **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A legendary stone tablet engraved with ancient text. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Holdable-Active**, meaning its effects are persistent during battle. While it has a technical cost, it is typically treated as a rare archaeological find or a key piece of lore rather than a common commodity.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily obtained through exploration or the Underground).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the power of the holder’s **Poison-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Multitype Interaction:** If held by **Arceus**, the Pokémon’s base type changes to **Poison**, and its signature move, **Judgment**, becomes a Poison-type attack.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in "Uber" tiers specifically to enable **Arceus-Poison**. Outside of Arceus, it is considered **Niche/Outclassed**; competitive Poison-type attackers usually prefer *Black Sludge* for recovery or *Life Orb* for a higher (30%) damage boost across all move types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Plates" cycle and interacts specifically with the **Multitype** ability. It cannot be removed or stolen via *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by an Arceus.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered in the **Sinnoh Underground** via mining. In later generations, it is often found in hidden locations (e.g., the Great Marsh or via the Abyssal Ruins) or sold by specialized "Bargain" merchants in the post-game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It is considered a unique artifact of the Pokémon world's creation myth, specifically representing one of the many essences of the creator deity, Arceus.
* **Attributes:** The item possesses the `underground` attribute, highlighting its historical connection to the Sinnoh region's excavation mechanics.
