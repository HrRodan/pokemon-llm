## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6134** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. Once activated, the localized raid remains active until the end of the current day. It is a single-use mission item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic low cost; effectively **Not for Sale** through standard in-game vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Dynamax Pokémon to appear as a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **SCO6134** crystal is programmed to spawn **Stonjourner**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle or flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item serves solely as an encounter trigger for the overworld. The resulting Pokémon, however, can be caught with specific IVs or Hidden Abilities common to Raid encounters, which may have competitive value.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Dynamax Crystal" sub-category, which are typically distributed via serial codes or special promotions (such as retail events or pre-order bonuses). It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed via **serial codes** (often associated with movie ticket sales or retail distributions in Japan and other regions). It is not obtainable through normal gameplay or Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended for event distribution.
* **Context:** In the Galar region lore, these crystals focus Power Spot energy to a specific point, allowing trainers to challenge version-exclusive Pokémon (Stonjourner is naturally exclusive to *Pokémon Sword*) regardless of their game version or current raid dens.
