## Identity & Utility
**Adamant Mint** is a **Nature-Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable herb that, when smelled by a Pokémon, alters its stat growth patterns. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that mimics the effects of the Adamant nature. While the JSON lists a cost of 20, this typically translates to **20 Battle Points (BP)** or **20 League Points (LP)** rather than standard currency, making it a **Special Acquisition** item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars/Points (**Specialty Currency/Premium Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently modifies the Pokémon's stat multipliers. It increases the growth rate of the **Attack** stat by 10% and decreases the growth rate of the **Sp. Atk** stat by 10%. 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon's actual Nature name (e.g., "Modest") remains unchanged in the summary screen, but the blue/red stat highlights will shift to reflect the Adamant Mint's influence.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility (Post-Game/Competitive Prep).** This item is a "Competitive Staple" for physical attackers. It revolutionized the meta by allowing players to optimize the stats of Legendaries, Mythicals, and Shiny Pokémon that were previously unviable due to poor Natures.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-management tool. It does not pass down the "Minted" nature through breeding (the original nature is used for inheritance).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained via the **Battle Tower** (Sword/Shield) or **Chansey Supply** shops (Scarlet/Violet). It can also be found as rare "sparkle" pickups in the overworld in newer regions like Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard Medicines, these are processed herbal enhancements found in high-level training facilities or specialized pharmacies.
* **World Knowledge:** The Adamant Mint is the physical attacker's gold standard, transforming any high-Physical-Attack Pokémon into its most efficient form by sacrificing its usually unnecessary Special Attack stat.
