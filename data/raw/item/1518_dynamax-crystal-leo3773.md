## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LEO3773** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay; it is tied to specific serial code distributions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; though its functional value is high, its resale price is negligible as it is an event-exclusive item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell area of the Wild Area), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **LEO3773** crystal is programmed to summon a Max Raid encounter with **Corviknight**. This raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) on which the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** While the item itself has no use in a competitive battle, it is used to guarantee an encounter with a Corviknight, which may possess its **Hidden Ability (Mirror Armor)** or the **Gigantamax Factor**, both of which are staples in VGC and Smogon's OU tier.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-only item**. The LEO3773 variant was primarily distributed via serial codes in Japan as part of a promotion with **CoroCoro Comic** (indicated by the "LEO" prefix, referring to the Leo zodiac sign used in their "Star" crystal series).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a digital distribution item that cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or Thief-style moves.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals served as a way for developers to give players guaranteed access to rare "Hidden" or Gigantamax encounters without the RNG associated with standard Wishing Pieces or den resets.
