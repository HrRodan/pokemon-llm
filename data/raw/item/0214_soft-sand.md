## Identity & Utility
**Soft Sand** is a **Type-enhancement** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A loose, silky sand to be held by a Pokémon. It provides a specialized power boost specifically for Ground-type techniques. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Holdable** and **Active** during battle.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the power of the holder’s **Ground-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **Niche/Playthrough staple**. While often outclassed in high-level competitive play by the *Life Orb* (which boosts all moves by 30% at the cost of HP) or *Earth Plate*, Soft Sand is highly valuable in "No-Item" formats or for players who want to boost Ground-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage without the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking of a *Choice Band*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a combat-enhancement tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in desert regions (e.g., Route 111 in Hoenn) or beach areas. It can also be purchased at certain specialized marts in later generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is frequently found on wild Ground-type Pokémon, making it easy to farm using the moves **Thief** or **Covet**. Common carriers include:
    * **Diglett / Dugtrio** (including Alolan forms)
    * **Sandslash**
    * **Trapinch**
    * **Nincada**
    * **Stunfisk**
* **Farming Tip:** Since it is held by 8 different species in the wild, it is one of the more easily accessible type-boosting items through wild encounters.
