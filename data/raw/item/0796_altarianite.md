## Identity & Utility
**Altarianite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by an Altaria, it allows the Pokémon to transcend its normal limits during battle. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). As a rare evolutionary tool, it has no standard retail value and cannot be sold for profit.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If held by an Altaria, the Trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transforms the Pokémon into **Mega Altaria**, altering its type from Dragon/Flying to **Dragon/Fairy** and granting it the ability **Pixilate**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Base damage). However, Mega Stones cannot be Flinged if the holder can use them to Mega Evolve.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility.** Mega Altaria is a premier threat in competitive formats (like Smogon’s UU or OU tiers and past VGC seasons). The shift to Dragon/Fairy provides excellent defensive utility (immunity to Dragon), while the **Pixilate** ability turns Normal-type moves like *Return*, *Double-Edge*, or *Hyper Voice* into STAB-boosted Fairy-type attacks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Altaria. It does not affect other Pokémon and is unaffected by the move *Thief* or *Covet* if held by the correct species. It cannot be removed via *Knock Off* once the Pokémon has Mega Evolved.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Hoenn (ORAS):** Obtained in Lilycove City by showing a specific NPC an Altaria.
    * **Alola (Gen VII):** Acquired via the **Battle Tree** for 64 Battle Points (BP) or through special limited-time distributions/events.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique treasure that generally requires a bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon to be located or utilized.
