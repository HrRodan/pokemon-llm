## Identity & Utility
**Skwovet Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a tuft of fur dropped by members of the Skwovet evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** specifically designed for use at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM). It cannot be used directly in battle or overworld for healing.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount, its primary value lies in its exchange rate for League Points (LP) or as a component for move crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. When combined with League Points (LP) and other Pokémon materials, it allows the player to "print" specific move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Preparation Only).** It has no direct competitive utility in a battle; however, it is essential for the "Teambuilding" phase to grant Pokémon access to specific competitive movesets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly categorized under the crafting subsystem introduced in the Ninth Generation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a reward after defeating or catching wild **Skwovet** or **Greedent**. It can also be found as sparkling pickups on the ground in areas where these Pokémon reside (such as Poco Path or South Province).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Skwovet** and **Greedent**. It is frequently gathered in the early game of *Scarlet & Violet* due to the abundance of Skwovet in starting areas.
