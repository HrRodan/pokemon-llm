## Identity & Utility
**Chansey Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy-booster. Unlike generic candies, it is tailored specifically to the Chansey evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is technically purchasable but primarily earned through gameplay mechanics.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low nominal cost, it is rarely bought in bulk from shops and is instead a reward for specific trainer actions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a member of the **Chansey or Blissey** family, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** in the form of **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Standard.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. Because AVs (Awakening Values) create massive stat inflation (up to +200 in every stat), Chansey Candy is banned from standard VGC and Smogon competitive formats, which rely on the traditional EV/IV system. It is essential, however, for defeating the **Chansey Master Trainer** in the post-game of *Let's Go*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancer. It bypasses the limitations of generic candies (like Health Candy), which have diminishing returns as a Pokémon's stats increase.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Chansey. Players receive these candies as rewards for achieving **Catch Combos** (catching multiple Chansey in a row) or by transferring Chansey to **Professor Oak**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is "farmed" through the **Catch Combo** mechanic, particularly in locations like Cerulean Cave where Chansey is a common spawn for leveling up.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Kanto region (Let's Go era), these candies represent the concentrated essence and effort of specialized training with a specific species, allowing a trainer to push a Chansey's physical and defensive capabilities far beyond their natural limits.
