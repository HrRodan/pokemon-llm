## Identity & Utility
**Pikachu Candy** is a **Species-Specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with energy tailored to the Pikachu evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is technically purchasable but primarily earned through gameplay mechanics. Unlike standard Rare Candies that increase Level, this item focuses on stat enhancement.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the sell value is low, its utility value is significantly higher due to the stat-boosting "Awakening Value" (AV) system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a member of the Pikachu family (Pikachu or Raichu, including Alolan Raichu), it increases **all six permanent stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 point. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item only exists in *Let's Go*, where the move Fling is not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is essential for "Master Trainer" battles and post-game content in the *Let's Go* series to reach maximum potential. It is irrelevant to standard VGC or Smogon tiers as it does not exist in the core Series 8+ or traditional Generation VII (Sun/Moon) engines.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally restricted to the **Pikachu species line**. It is the most efficient way to maximize Awakening Values (AVs) compared to generic candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy), which only boost one stat at a time and have level requirements.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Pikachu in a "Catch Combo," transferring multiple Pikachu to Professor Oak, or by walking with a Pikachu stored in the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the "Capture Research" mechanic. Farming this item is a core loop for players looking to optimize a Pikachu or Raichu for the endgame "Master Trainer" challenges.
