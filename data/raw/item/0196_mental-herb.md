## Identity & Utility
**Mental Herb** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A single-use held item that allows a Pokémon to "shake off" mental interference. While initially limited in scope, it has evolved into a versatile tool for ensuring a Pokémon can execute its moves regardless of opponent disruption. It is a **Consumable** item that is **Holdable** and activates automatically in battle.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive; typically found in specialized shops or Battle Frontier/Subway vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is affected by certain mental status conditions, the Mental Herb is consumed to instantly cure them. 
    * **Legacy (Gen III–IV):** Only cures **Infatuation** (Attract).
    * **Modern (Gen V+):** Cures **Infatuation, Taunt, Encore, Torment, Disable, and Heal Block.**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. When used with the move **Fling**, the herb is thrown at the target, curing them of the mental status conditions listed above.
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple**, specifically for "Lead" Pokémon or "Trick Room" setters (like Cresselia or Porygon2). It prevents the holder from being shut down by a faster opponent's **Taunt**, ensuring vital utility moves are successful.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. However, it is a frequent target for the ability **Pickup** and can be circumvented by the ability **Unnerve** (which prevents berry consumption, though Mental Herb is an herb, it is often grouped in disruption-prevention logic) or **Klutz** (which prevents the user from using it).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available in late-game Poké Marts, Battle Facilities (for BP), or found in the overworld in lush, forested areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is naturally occurring in the wild. It can be farmed from the following Pokémon families (5% chance):
    * **Lotad / Lombre / Ludicolo**
    * **Sewaddle / Swadloon / Leavanny**
    * **Pancham / Pangoro**
* **Farming Tip:** Using a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet** on wild Lotad or Sewaddle is the most efficient way to acquire multiple Mental Herbs outside of purchasing them.
