## Identity & Utility
**Chalky Stone** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!* era).
* **Description:** A small, whitish stone picked up at the edge of the road. It serves as "vendor trash"—an item with no practical use in battle or training, intended primarily to be sold to Poké Marts. It is a **Consumable/Loot** item that is technically purchasable but rarely stocked in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Chalky Stone has no primary effect. It cannot be used to heal Pokémon, enhance stats, or trigger evolution. Its sole function in the game economy is to be sold for a small amount of currency.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides a weak physical attack with no secondary status effects when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no viable application in VGC, Smogon, or casual battle formats as it provides no held-item benefits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution and has no unique interactions with abilities like Pickup or Klutz beyond being a valid target for the item-removal effects.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the *Let's Go* series, this item is frequently found as a hidden item in various routes and caves. It is often discovered by the player's partner Pokémon (Pikachu or Eevee) or by following Pokémon who "sniff out" items in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through overworld exploration and interacting with the environment, representing the mundane objects a trainer might find while traveling between towns.
