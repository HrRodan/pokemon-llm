## Identity & Utility
**Friend Ball** is an **Apricorn-ball** introduced in Generation II (though categorized in Generation IV in this dataset).
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball that facilitates a bond between the Trainer and the caught Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Poké Ball** that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts. It is recognized by its green shell with red and yellow accents, traditionally crafted from organic materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Because it is crafted from Apricorns or rewarded in limited quantities, it lacks a standard retail price and is considered a rare "Apri-ball" among collectors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used to successfully catch a wild Pokémon, the Pokémon’s base **Happiness (Friendship) is immediately set to 200**. For context, most Pokémon normally start with a base happiness of 70 or 120. It has a **1x Catch Rate modifier**, making it exactly as effective as a standard Poké Ball for the actual capture.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** High **Niche/Utility** value. While it provides no combat bonuses, it is a "time-saver" for competitive breeding. It is used to instantly trigger **Friendship-based Evolutions** (e.g., Eevee into Espeon/Umbreon, Golbat into Crobat, or Chansey into Blissey) with minimal additional training. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates evolutions that require a high friendship threshold (usually 220+). In modern competitive VGC, it is also highly prized for **"Aesthetics,"** as trainers prefer matching the green color of the ball to Shiny Pokémon or Grass-types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically crafted by the artisan **Kurt in Azalea Town** (Johto region) using **Green Apricorns**. In more recent titles (Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet), it is often a rare reward from the Poké Ball Guy or an Academy Ace Tournament prize, making it a high-value trade item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It must be obtained via crafting, specific NPCs, or special event distributions. It is essentially a "legacy" item tied to Johto's traditional Poké Ball smithing techniques.
