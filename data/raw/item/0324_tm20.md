## Identity & Utility
**TM20** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current "Safeguard" form in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to provide a Pokémon with the move **Safeguard**. It creates a protective field that shields the user's entire team from status problems like poison, paralysis, burn, and sleep for five turns. It is a **Consumable/Permanent** (depending on the specific game generation) item that can be bought.
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Expensive**). This high price point typically classifies it as a "Luxury" or "End-game" TM, often found in major Department Stores or high-tier shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Safeguard** to a compatible Pokémon. Safeguard prevents the user and its allies from being afflicted by non-volatile status conditions (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) and Confusion. It does not remove existing status conditions but prevents new ones from being applied.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have no base power/effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Tactical.** In competitive play (VGC and Smogon), Safeguard is a situational tool used to shut down "Status Spam" or "Prankster" builds that rely on *Spore*, *Will-O-Wisp*, or *Thunder Wave*. While it provides team-wide protection, it has largely been superseded in modern metas by **Misty Terrain**, which offers similar protection with additional benefits for grounded Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no direct effect on evolution. Its primary interaction is with the Pokémon's move set. Historically, the move taught by TM20 has changed: it taught **Rage** in Gen I and **Endure** in Gen II before stabilizing as **Safeguard** in Hoenn (Gen III).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually purchased at major **Department Stores** (e.g., Lilycove City, Veilstone City, or the Celadon Department Store in later versions). Its 100,000 price tag reflects its utility as a powerful defensive utility move.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. As a man-made data disc, it is exclusively distributed through shops, Gym Leaders, or found as localized treasure (item balls) in the overworld. In newer generations (Gen VIII+), it is often replaced by TRs or craftable TMs using the TM Machine.
