## Identity & Utility
**Ground Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** (Specialized Crafting Material) introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystalline fragment containing Ground-type energy. It is a **Consumable** material used primarily for modifying a Pokémon's fundamental Terastal energy. While it has a defined cost, it is rarely purchased and instead must be gathered through exploration or combat.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible** for selling; however, its value lies in its utility as a rare resource rather than its monetary worth).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Collecting **50 Ground Tera Shards** allows a Trainer to change a Pokémon's Tera Type to Ground. This process is handled by the chef at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** after the player has defeated the Medali Gym Leader.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Impact.** Ground is one of the most strategically significant Tera Types in VGC and Smogon formats. It is frequently used defensively to provide a total immunity to Electric-type moves (nullifying *Volt Switch*, *Thunder Wave*, and *Regieleki's* signature moves) and offensively to grant **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** to powerful Ground-type moves like *Earthquake* or *Earth Power*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a specific mechanic-related item for the **Terastal** phenomenon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for successfully completing **Ground-type Tera Raid Battles** (higher star ratings yield more shards). They are also found as hidden items (sparkling floor nodes) throughout the Paldea region, particularly in **Area Zero**, and can be earned as rewards from the **Academy Ace Tournament** or the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame in Kitakami.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, these are gathered through the ecosystem's Tera energy rather than via the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
