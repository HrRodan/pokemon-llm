## Identity & Utility
**Venonat Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological specimen dropped by the Venonat evolutionary line. It serves as a specialized crafting reagent used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Reagent** that cannot be used directly from the bag to heal or buff a Pokémon, nor can it be held in battle for any effect.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Inexpensive). While it has a low sell price, its primary value is its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use in move crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP), it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly a utility resource for team building and move-pool expansion; it has no utility in active combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the **Technical Machine Machine** interface. In the context of Gen IX mechanics, it represents the "Poison/Bug" essence of the Venonat line, typically required for TMs like **TM045 (Venoshock)** or **TM091 (Toxic Spikes)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Venonat family. It is a common resource in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Drop:** Found exclusively by encountering wild **Venonat** and **Venomoth**. Because these Pokémon are often found in forested or grassy biomes (such as the Tagtree Thicket), players can efficiently farm these fangs by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature to quickly clear groups of Venonat.
