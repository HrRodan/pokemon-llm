## Identity & Utility
**Green Dish** is a **Picnic** accessory introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A cosmetic customization item specifically used during the Picnic mechanic. It serves as a visual overhaul for the tableware used when preparing sandwiches and interacting with Pokémon in the overworld. It is a **Non-consumable / Cosmetic** item that is not typically found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Default acquisition). In the context of the Paldea region, such items are often part of a player's starting equipment or obtained via specialty "Picnic-Knacks" vendors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When selected in the Picnic customization menu, it changes the appearance of the dishes on the picnic table to a green color scheme. This effect is purely aesthetic and provides no mechanical bonuses to Meal Powers or sandwich quality.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists exclusively for the overworld Picnic sub-game and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution, nor does it interact with abilities like Pickup, Klutz, or Sticky Hold. It is stored in the "Main Items" or "Picnic Item" pocket of the bag rather than the "Held Items" pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary availability is within the **Paldea region**. Players can change their picnic setup at any time while picnicking by interacting with the table. The Green Dish is generally considered a basic customization option available to the player to personalize their camping experience.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It cannot be farmed or generated via the **Pickup** ability, as it is classified as a permanent accessory rather than a consumable resource.
