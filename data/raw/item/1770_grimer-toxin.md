## Identity & Utility
**Grimer Toxin** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a biological sample dropped by members of the Grimer evolutionary line. It serves as a specialized crafting reagent used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create specific TMs. It is a **Consumable Reagent** that cannot be used directly from the bag to heal or buff Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While its sell price is low, its primary value lies in its use as a currency for Technical Machine creation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a required ingredient for crafting Poison-type Technical Machines. Players must combine Grimer Toxin with League Points (LP) at a Pokémon Center's TM Machine to produce moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios. Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy of the Paldea region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting material and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Grimer** or **Muk** (including their Alolan forms if encountered in relevant DLC areas). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Unlike traditional held items, this is part of the "TM Materials" mechanic where the item is automatically added to the inventory upon the conclusion of a battle with the corresponding Pokémon species. It is most efficiently farmed in areas where Grimer outbreaks occur, such as near industrial zones or rocky outskirts.
