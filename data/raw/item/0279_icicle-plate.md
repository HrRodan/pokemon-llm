## Identity & Utility
**Icicle-plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A legendary stone tablet engraved with ancient text. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that serves a dual purpose: it acts as a power booster for Ice-type techniques and as a transformative catalyst for specific legendary Pokémon. While it has a technical internal value, it is typically found through exploration or mining rather than purchased at a standard Mart.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily acquired through world interaction).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of **Ice-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Multitype Interaction:** If held by **Arceus**, the Pokémon's base type changes to **Ice**. Consequently, its signature move, **Judgment**, also becomes Ice-type. This effect is permanent as long as the item is held and cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Trick* when held by Arceus.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High physical damage; notable for being one of the stronger Fling options).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the 20% boost is identical to the *Never-Melt Ice*, Plates are often used on **Arceus-Ice** in Ubers formats. For other Pokémon, it is a niche alternative to *Life Orb* or *Choice* items when a player wants to boost Ice-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) without recoil or move-locking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is essential for accessing the Ice-type form of Arceus. It is flagged as `underground`, meaning in its debut generation, it was a rare find within the Sinnoh Underground.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in cold, remote locations (e.g., near Snowpoint City in Sinnoh) or via the **Underground/Grand Underground** mining minigame. In later generations, it is often rewarded by NPCs or found in hidden areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** held by any wild Pokémon. It is considered a unique relic.
* **Lore Context:** According to Sinnoh myths, Plates are fragments of the power used by the "Original One" to create the universe. The Icicle Plate specifically represents the essence of freezing cold.
