## Identity & Utility
**Clefairy Candy** is a **Species-specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!* and *Let’s Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with concentrated energy. Unlike standard Rare Candies or Exp. Candies, this item is designed to permanently enhance the physical and special attributes of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally not purchased in bulk from standard Marts, though it has a nominal resale value.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon in the **Clefairy line** (Cleffa, Clefairy, or Clefable), it increases all six of the Pokémon’s stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 point**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Awakening Values (AVs):** This item is the primary vehicle for the "AV" mechanic in the Kanto-revisit titles. Unlike traditional Effort Values (EVs) which have a 510-point cap, Clefairy Candy allows a Pokémon to reach a maximum of **+200 in every stat**, leading to significantly inflated power levels compared to traditional RPG entries.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic is not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** It is a mandatory requirement for "No Restrictions" competitive play within the *Let’s Go* ecosystem to ensure a Pokémon is "stat-maxed." It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats (Gen 8+), as the item does not exist in those data structures.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is most effective when used on a **Clefable** intended for high-level endgame content or Master Trainer battles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Clefairy Candy is primarily acquired through the **Catch Combo** mechanic. Catching multiple Clefairy in succession increases the yield of these candies. It can also be obtained by transferring Clefairy to **Professor Oak** or by walking with a Clefairy in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally held by wild Pokémon. It is rewarded as a "drop" upon a successful capture or as a reward for specialized training tasks. Its presence signifies the unique bond between a Trainer’s research (catching/transferring) and the Pokémon's growth.
