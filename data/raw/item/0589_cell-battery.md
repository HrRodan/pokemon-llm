## Identity & Utility
**Cell Battery** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that acts as a specialized capacitor. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that boosts the user's offensive presence when triggered by specific incoming energy. It can be bought at various specialized shops and Battle Facilities across the Pokémon world.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Pricey** for a single-use consumable).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by an **Electric-type** damaging move, its **Attack** stat is raised by one stage (+1). Upon activation, the item is consumed and disappears. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily a **Niche/Situational** item. Unlike "Absorb" abilities (like Motor Drive or Volt Absorb), the Cell Battery **does not grant immunity** to the Electric move; the holder still takes damage. In competitive play, it is occasionally seen in Doubles formats where a teammate uses a weak Electric move (like *Discharge*) to manually trigger the boost on a physical sweeper. 
    * **Interaction Note:** The item will not trigger if the Pokémon is immune to Electric-type damage (e.g., Ground-types) or if the move is neutralized by an ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not required for any known Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available in high-end Department Stores (like the R9 Department Store in Unova) or purchasable via BP (Battle Points) in various Battle Facilities.

    * **Plusle** and **Minun**
    * **Charjabug**
    * **Alolan Geodude**, **Alolan Graveler**, and **Alolan Golem**
* **Farming Tip:** Players can use the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief**, **Covet**, or **Magician** to harvest these batteries from wild Alolan Geodude or Charjabug in their respective regions.
