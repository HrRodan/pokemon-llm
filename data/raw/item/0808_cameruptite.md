## Identity & Utility
**Cameruptite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*), though documented in this record within the context of Generation VII.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to be held by the Pokémon Camerupt. It serves as the catalyst for Mega Evolution, allowing the Pokémon to transcend its normal form during battle. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Mega Stones are typically obtained through story events, gifts from NPCs, or specialized vendors using non-standard currency like Battle Points.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Camerupt, it allows the Pokémon to **Mega Evolve** into Mega Camerupt, provided the Trainer has a Mega Bracelet or Mega Ring. This transformation significantly boosts Camerupt's Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense while lowering its Speed and granting it the **Sheer Force** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: While it has a high Fling power, Mega Stones generally cannot be removed from the user in competitive play via moves like Knock Off, Thief, or Fling if held by the correct Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily utilized in **Trick Room** teams due to Mega Camerupt’s significantly reduced Speed and massive Special Attack. Its ability, **Sheer Force**, makes it a premier wallbreaker in specific Smogon tiers (like RU or UU) and a niche pick in VGC formats that allow Mega Evolution.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to the Camerupt line. It does not trigger a permanent evolution; the effect is temporary and lasts only for the duration of a single battle. It bypasses effects like *Klutz* if the Pokémon is already Mega Evolved, but generally, a Pokémon with *Klutz* cannot activate the stone.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Hoenn/ORAS), it is obtained from Maxie (Omega Ruby) or Tabitha (Alpha Sapphire) during the Delta Episode or at the Battle Resort. In Generation VII (Alola), it was distributed via Mystery Gift or purchased at the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique artifact that cannot be farmed; players are typically limited to one per save file through traditional means.
