## Identity & Utility
**Twisted-Spoon** is a **Type-Enhancement** held item introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** An item imbued with telekinetic power that sharpens the mental focus of the holder. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that can be bought for a low price, though it is rarely found in standard retail marts and is more commonly sourced from the wild.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the power of the holder’s **Psychic-type moves by 20%**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides base damage with no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Mid-tier. In high-level play (VGC or Smogon), it is generally outclassed by the **Life Orb** (30% boost to all moves) or **Choice Specs** (50% boost but locks the user into one move). Its primary value lies in "Item Clause" formats where Life Orb is already taken, or for Psychic-type attackers that require a power boost without the HP recoil of a Life Orb or the tactical restriction of a Choice item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is the signature thematic item for the Alakazam line, reflecting their lore as masters of telekinesis who use spoons as focal points for their energy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specific overworld locations (often associated with psychics or ruins) or via special shops in later generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is most reliably gathered from the wild. It is held by **Abra (5%)**, **Kadabra (5%)**, and **Alakazam (5%)**. Because Abra frequently uses *Teleport* to flee, farming this item typically requires a Pokémon with the **No Guard** ability, the move **Thief**, or the use of a **Quick Ball**. It is a common target for players utilizing the **Pickup** ability or specialized "Frisk/Thief" farming builds.
