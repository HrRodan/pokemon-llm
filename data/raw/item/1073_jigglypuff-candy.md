## Identity & Utility
**Jigglypuff Candy** is a **Species-Specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized candy infused with energy tailored to the Jigglypuff evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts, though it carries a nominal internal value. It is used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's performance.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**). While it has a low sell price, its value lies in the effort required to farm it rather than its monetary cost.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Jigglypuff family (Jigglypuff or Wigglytuff), it increases **all six stats simultaneously** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. This contributes to the "Awakening Value" (AV) system, allowing a Pokémon to reach a maximum of +200 in every stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Standard.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is essential for "Master Trainer" battles and "No Restrictions" online play, but has no effect in standard competitive formats (VGC or Smogon) which utilize the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon use and is only effective on **Jigglypuff** and **Wigglytuff**. It bypasses the level requirements and stat-specific limitations of standard candies (like Mighty or Quick Candies).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching large quantities of Jigglypuff to build a "Catch Combo" or by transferring Jigglypuff to Professor Oak. It can also be found as a reward for walking a Jigglypuff in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense. Instead, it is a reward for the "Capture" mechanic. In the context of *Let's Go*, it is most efficiently gathered by **farming wild Jigglypuff** on Route 5, 6, 7, or 8 and trading them to the Professor for mass quantities of species-specific candy.
