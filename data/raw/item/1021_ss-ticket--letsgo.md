## Identity & Utility
**S.S. Ticket (Let's Go Version)** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (*Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A physical ticket featuring a drawing of a luxury liner. It is a mandatory **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It is required to bypass the guard at the docks in Vermilion City to board the S.S. Anne.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to the S.S. Anne cruise ship. This is a critical narrative gate; boarding the ship is necessary to meet the Captain and obtain the **Secret Technique: Chop Down** (the *Let's Go* equivalent of HM01 Cut), which is required to progress to the Vermilion Gym and beyond.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld story progression and cannot be utilized in any competitive format or battle scenario.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it stays in the "Key Items" pocket of the Bag and cannot be held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a gift from **Bill** at his Sea Cottage on **Route 25**. The player receives the ticket as a reward for helping Bill return to his human form after a teleporter accident.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item designated for the protagonist's journey through the Kanto region.
* **Lore Note:** While this specific data entry pertains to the Generation VII remake, the S.S. Ticket is a legacy item dating back to the original Kanto games. In the *Let's Go* series, the ship departs the harbor once the player has finished their business with the Captain, rendering the ticket a commemorative item for the remainder of the playthrough.
