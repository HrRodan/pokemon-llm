## Identity & Utility
**TR62 (Dragon Pulse)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Dragon Pulse**. Unlike TMs (Technical Machines) in most generations, TRs are single-use items that break after one use. It represents a "shattering" of the move-teaching data into the Pokémon's memory.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While listed with a monetary value, it is primarily traded for **Watts (W)** at Watt Traders in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Pulse** to a compatible Pokémon. Dragon Pulse is a Special Dragon-type move with 85 Power and 100% Accuracy. It is known for its reliability and lack of negative side effects (unlike Draco Meteor).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 85 (High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Dragon Pulse is the go-to Special Dragon-type coverage for many Pokémon. While Draco Meteor offers more raw power, TR62 is preferred on sustained special attackers who cannot afford the Special Attack drop, or for Pokémon with the ability **Mega Launcher** (which boosts Dragon Pulse's power).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "draconic" or "mystical" Pokémon, as well as several non-Dragon types that can learn move-pool coverage (e.g., Blastoise, Lucario, Milotic).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar Region (Sword/Shield), TR62 is frequently sold by **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts. It is also a common reward for defeating **Dragon-type Pokémon** in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through trade or raid victories, reflecting its status as a high-tier technical record.
* **Lore Context:** The flavor text ("a shock wave generated by the user’s gaping mouth") suggests the move is an extension of a Pokémon's internal draconic energy, harnessed and released as a focused vibration.
