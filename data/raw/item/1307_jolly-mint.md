## Identity & Utility
**Jolly Mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized aromatic herb that modifies a Pokémon's stat growth patterns. When consumed, it causes the Pokémon's Speed to increase more effectively while Special Attack increases more slowly. It is a **Consumable** item used from the bag; it cannot be held for a battle effect.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (API value); however, in practice, this is a **High-Value/Endgame** item usually purchased for 50 BP (Battle Points) or 20,000 Poké Dollars at specialized shops like Chansey Supply.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently changes the Pokémon's stat modifiers to match the **Jolly Nature** (+10% Speed, -10% Special Attack). 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon's actual "Nature" remains its original birth nature for breeding purposes (passing down natures via Everstone), but the visual stat highlights (Blue/Red text) and calculation values are updated to the Jolly profile.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Essential.** This is a staple for competitive physical attackers (e.g., Zacian-Crowned, Meowscarada, Roaring Moon) that require maximum Speed to move first while sacrificing the Special Attack stat they do not use.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for optimization of a Pokémon's "Individual Values" and "Effort Values" synergy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sword/Shield:** Purchased at the Battle Tower for 50 BP.
    * **Scarlet/Violet:** Purchased at Chansey Supply branches after earning enough Gym Badges, or found as rare sparkling pickups in the overworld (Area Zero).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is typically a manufactured or rare botanical item found in high-level training environments.
