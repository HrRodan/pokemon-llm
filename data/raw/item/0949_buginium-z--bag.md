## Identity & Utility
**Buginium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This specialized crystal is designed to harness Z-Power, upgrading a Pokémon's Bug-type moves into devastating Z-Moves. Unlike standard items, the "bag" variant represents the key item inventory entry used to manage the crystal before it is equipped. It is a **Held Item/Key Item hybrid** that is **not consumable** and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with at least one Bug-type move, it allows the user to perform the Z-Move **Savage Spin-Out** once per battle. 
    * If the base move is a **Physical or Special** attack, the Z-Move deals massive damage based on the original move's power.
    * If the base move is a **Status** move (e.g., *Quiver Dance* or *Sticky Web*), it transforms into a **Z-Status move**, providing the original effect plus a secondary stat boost (e.g., Z-Quiver Dance grants a +1 to Special Attack in addition to its usual effects).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed from a Pokémon by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility (Gen VII).** It is a staple on offensive Bug-types like **Volcarona**, **Scizor**, and **Buzzwole**. It allows these Pokémon to bypass their usual counters by dealing a massive burst of "nuke" damage, or to gain critical momentum via Z-Status boosts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is immune to the effects of the ability **Klutz** (the user can still use the Z-Move) and cannot be switched via **Trick** or **Switcheroo**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the Buginium Z is typically obtained in **Shady House** (Po Town) after defeating **Guzma**, the leader of Team Skull. This reflects his mastery over Bug-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item given to the player during the main storyline or through specific trials.
* **Lore Context:** Z-Crystals are fragments of Necrozma's body that fell to Alola, allowing trainers to resonate with their Pokémon's energy. The Buginium Z specifically resonates with the chitinous and swarming nature of Bug-type essence.
