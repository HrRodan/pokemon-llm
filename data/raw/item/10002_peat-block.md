## Identity & Utility
**Peat Block** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A block of muddy peat that seems to be a favorite of certain Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts. It represents a specialized material used to trigger unique regional evolutions.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through exploration or special vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the evolution of **Ursaring** into **Ursaluna**. 
* **Specific Requirements:** In its debut game (*Pokémon Legends: Arceus*), the item must be used on Ursaring specifically during a **Full Moon** while in the **Crimson Mirelands**. In subsequent generations, it remains the dedicated evolutionary trigger for this species.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Evolution items like the Peat Block typically cannot be held in a way that utilizes Fling in a competitive capacity).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Developmental.** While the item itself has no utility in battle, it is the sole gatekeeper to obtaining **Ursaluna**, which is a top-tier competitive threat in both VGC and Smogon formats due to its massive Attack and HP stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon use. It is a one-to-one evolutionary trigger and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat scenario.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Hisui Region** (Crimson Mirelands) by using the **Ursaluna Mount** to sniff out buried treasure. It is rarely sold by the **Ginkgo Guild** (Ginter) in Jubilife Village as a "Sooty Block."
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard evolutionary stones, this is a "lost" material that must be scavenged from the earth, emphasizing the archaeological and survivalist themes of the Hisui region.
