## Identity & Utility
**Eviolite** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Described as a "mysterious Evolutionary lump," it is a passive held item that provides a massive defensive boost to Pokémon that have not yet reached their final evolutionary stage. It is a permanent held item (not consumed upon use) and is generally not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard; however, it is typically treated as a rare or limited-quantity find in-game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is a Pokémon that is capable of evolving (i.e., not fully evolved), its **Defense and Special Defense are increased by 50% (1.5× multiplier)**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 40 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/Staple.** This is one of the most meta-defining items in Pokémon history. It allows certain mid-stage Pokémon to become bulkier than their evolved counterparts. It is a cornerstone of the **Little Cup (LC)** format and makes Pokémon like **Chansey, Porygon2, Dusclops, and Galarian Corsola** top-tier defensive threats in Smogon and VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * The effect only applies if there is a Pokémon "above" the holder in its evolutionary chain. Single-stage Pokémon (e.g., Tauros) receive no benefit.
    * If a Pokémon gains a new evolution in a later generation (such as Primeape or Bisharp), it retroactively becomes eligible to use Eviolite.
    * **Counters:** The item is heavily countered by **Knock Off**, **Trick**, or **Switcheroo**, as the holder's bulk relies entirely on the item remaining held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a hidden item or a gift from an NPC (e.g., a scientist in Castelia City in its debut games). In later generations, it can sometimes be purchased at specialized Battle Frontier/Battle Tree shops for BP (Battle Points).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through exploration or as a reward for reaching specific milestones in the game's story.
