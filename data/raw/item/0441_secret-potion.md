## Identity & Utility
**Secret Potion** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in Generation II and featured prominently in the Generation IV Sinnoh region.
* **Description:** A specialized, high-potency medicine dispensed exclusively by the pharmacy in Cianwood City. Despite its name, it does not function like a standard Potion for the player's party; it is a **Key Item** used strictly for overworld progression. It cannot be used in battle or on the player's Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a narrative key to remove roadblocks. 
    * **In Johto (Gen II/IV):** It is required to cure "Amphy" (the Ampharos) at the Olivine Lighthouse, which allows the Gym Leader Jasmine to return to her Gym.
    * **In Sinnoh (Gen IV):** It is used to cure the group of Psyduck suffering from chronic headaches on Route 210, opening the path to Celestic Town.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It serves no mechanical purpose in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive format. Its utility is restricted to "Plot Advancement."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts solely with overworld NPC Pokémon (Ampharos/Psyduck) via scripted events.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Johto:** Obtained from the pharmacist in Cianwood City after speaking with Jasmine at the Glitter Lighthouse.
    * **Sinnoh:** Obtained from Cynthia near the Great Marsh/Pastoria City (or after the Team Galactic event in Veilstone in certain versions) to assist with the Route 210 blockade.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item that cannot be found on wild Pokémon or retrieved via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The Secret Potion represents a "Tier 0" medicinal grade—medicine so powerful it is treated as a plot device rather than a consumable. While the flavor text claims it "fully heals a Pokémon of any ailment," the game engine restricts this miracle-cure status to narrative-heavy scenarios involving Pokémon that are essential to the region's stability (lighting a lighthouse) or path-clearing.
