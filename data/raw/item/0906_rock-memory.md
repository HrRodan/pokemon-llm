## Identity & Utility
**Rock Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech memory disc designed for a specific artificial Pokémon. It serves as a type-shifting module that alters the physical composition and elemental affinity of the holder. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that can be purchased for a relatively low price, though it is typically acquired as part of a specialized gear set.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, this item triggers the **RKS System** ability, changing Silvally’s base type to **Rock**. Additionally, it changes the type of the move **Multi-Attack** to Rock-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Species-Specific.** Silvally-Rock is primarily used in lower Smogon tiers (like PU/ZU) or specific restricted formats. As a Rock-type, it gains the 1.5x Special Defense boost in Sandstorm. However, because it occupies the item slot, Silvally cannot hold a Life Orb or Choice item, making it a specialized utility attacker or pivot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **RKS System** ability. It has no effect on other Pokémon and is not consumed upon use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most titles (Sun/Moon, Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet), the Rock Memory is not found in standard Poké Marts but is instead gifted to the player by NPCs (such as Gladion or an Aide) upon receiving **Type: Null** or evolving it into Silvally. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured item specifically created by the Aether Foundation to unlock the potential of the "Beast Killer" project.
