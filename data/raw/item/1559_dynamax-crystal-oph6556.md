## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal OPH6556** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-exclusive Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized crystal that, when used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a single-use consumable item that remains active only until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a internal cost value, it is not traditionally purchasable in Poke Marts and is typically obtained via special distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal can be consumed to force a Max Raid Battle to appear. 
* **Target Pokémon:** Specifically, the **OPH6556** variant is associated with promotional distributions for **Gigantamax Orbeetle**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld meant to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon or the farming of Raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, and Berries). It has no function in trainer-vs-trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts strictly with the **Max Raid Den** mechanic in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Code** as part of promotional events (such as the "CoroCoro" or other regional retail partnerships). It is not found through standard gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a "Special Acquisition" item delivered via Mystery Gift.
* **World Knowledge Context:** Dynamax Crystals were a unique solution to "event Pokémon," allowing players to battle and catch the event Pokémon themselves (often with 5-star difficulty) rather than simply receiving the Pokémon directly from a deliveryman. This allowed players to choose their preferred Poké Ball and participate in the raid with friends.
