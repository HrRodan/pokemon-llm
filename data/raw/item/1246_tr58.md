## Identity & Utility
**TR58 (Dark Pulse)** is a **Consumable Machine (Technical Record)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Dark Pulse**. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in Generation VIII, Technical Records are single-use consumables that break after teaching the move. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased, though primarily via specialized currency.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for Watts (W) at Watt Traders in the Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dark Pulse** to a compatible Pokémon. Dark Pulse is a Special Dark-type move with a base power of 80 and a 20% chance to cause the target to flinch.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High.** Dark Pulse is the gold standard for Special Dark-type coverage. It is a staple on Pokémon like Hydreigon, Darkrai, and Gengar. The 20% flinch chance makes it particularly effective on fast attackers or those using a Choice Scarf to "flinch-lock" opponents.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use and cannot be reused unless another copy is acquired.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR58 is frequently rewarded for defeating Dark-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It is also sold by **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area on a rotating daily stock for 3,000 Watts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through the Galar region's Max Raid infrastructure or the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion.
