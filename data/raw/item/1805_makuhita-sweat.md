## Identity & Utility
**Makuhita Sweat** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a biological trace left behind by the Makuhita evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a Technical Machine Machine. It cannot be used directly in the overworld or held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Common crafting component).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft various **Technical Machines (TMs)** at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. The "sweat" is combined with League Points (LP) and other materials to create permanent move-teaching discs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in active combat. Its value is strictly relegated to the "prep-work" of competitive play (crafting the TMs needed to optimize a Pokémon's moveset).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX material economy. It is commonly used for crafting physical-based or Fighting-type moves such as **TM058 (Brick Break)** or **TM167 (Close Combat)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed automatically as a reward after defeating or catching wild members of the Makuhita family. It can also be traded at the TM Machine for **League Points (LP)**.
* **Wild Drop Source:** Dropped by wild **Makuhita** and **Hariyama**. In the Paldea region, these Pokémon are frequently found in cavernous areas or rocky provinces, making the sweat a common resource for trainers exploring those biomes.
