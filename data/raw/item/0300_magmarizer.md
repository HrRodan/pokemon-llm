## Identity & Utility
**Magmarizer** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized container packed with high-density magma energy. It serves as a specific evolutionary catalyst for Magmar. It is a **consumable held item** that is used during a trade to trigger metamorphosis. 
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard**). While it has a listed value, it is often found as a rare collectible or exchangeable for BP (Battle Points) rather than bought at standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When **Magmar** holds this item and is **traded** to another player, it evolves into **Magmortar**. The item is consumed and disappears upon the completion of the evolution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High). It lacks a secondary status effect when thrown, but provides significant raw damage for a Fling-based move.
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no competitive utility** in active battles. Its sole purpose is facilitating evolution. Magmortar, the resulting evolution, is a powerful offensive Fire-type, making the item essential for players looking to utilize Magmortar's high Special Attack and diverse movepool in lower-tier competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the mechanical counterpart to the **Electirizer**. It specifically interacts with the Magmar evolutionary line and is required to bridge the gap between the Johto-era Magmar and the Sinnoh-era Magmortar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in volcanic environments (e.g., Stark Mountain, Wela Volcano Park) or provided by NPCs who study magmatic Pokémon. In various games, it can be purchased at Battle Frontiers or via specialized shops like the Ginter's Specials in Hisui.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item can be farmed from wild encounters. It is occasionally held by wild **Magby**, **Magmar**, and **Magmortar**. Trainers typically use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability to identify the item and moves like **Thief** or **Covet** to retrieve it without capturing the Pokémon.
