## Identity & Utility
**Curry Powder** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A pungent, flavorful seasoning used during the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable ingredient that provides specific boosts to Meal Powers. Unlike held items, it is used exclusively in the overworld sandwich-making mini-game.
* **Cost:** 450 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a seasoning during sandwich creation to influence **Meal Powers**. In the Paldean culinary system, Curry Powder is known for significantly boosting **Humungo Power** (increasing the size of encountered Pokémon) and **Exp. Power**, while providing flavor profiles that lean towards "Spicy" and "Bitter."
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Sandwich ingredients are stored in a specific pocket and cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While it has no effect in a Pokémon's move set or held item slot, it is utilized by competitive players to trigger **Exp. Power** for rapid leveling or **Raid Power** for farming Tera Shards and Ability Patches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the Picnic mechanic and does not trigger abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized food vendors throughout the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia and **Sure Cans** outlets once the player has obtained a sufficient number of Gym Badges (typically 1-3 Badges depending on the store's inventory tier).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a processed seasoning, distinguishing it from raw materials like Berries or herbs that can be found in the wild.
