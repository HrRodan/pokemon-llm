## Identity & Utility
**TM208 (Hard Press)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within *The Indigo Disk* expansion for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that imparts the move **Hard Press** to a compatible Pokémon. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly at a TM Machine once unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In the context of the Paldea/Blueberry Academy economy, it is acquired via crafting using **4,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hard Press**. 
    * **Move Type:** Steel (Physical).
    * **Move Logic:** The power of this move depends on the target's remaining HP. The more HP the target has remaining, the greater the move's power (Base Power = $100 \times \frac{\text{Current HP}}{\text{Max HP}}$).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs in Generation IX are not holdable items and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Experimental. It is primarily used by physical Steel-type attackers (like Metagross or Iron Treads) as a high-damage opening move. However, its efficacy drops significantly as the opponent’s health decreases, making it less reliable than stable options like *Iron Head* or *Heavy Slam* in prolonged VGC or Smogon matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Machine" category item, meaning it is compatible with the **TM Machine** crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Location:** Found as a physical item in the **Canyon Biome** of the Terarium (Blueberry Academy).
    * **Crafting:** Can be manufactured at any TM Machine using **3× Orthworm Tarnish** and **3× Varoom Sections**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. The materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating wild **Orthworm** and **Varoom/Revavroom**.
