## Identity & Utility
**Dubious-disc** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A transparent, high-tech device containing questionable and unverified data of unknown origin. It is a **Consumable Held Item** used specifically to trigger a trade-based evolution. While it has a defined price, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts and is typically treated as a rare specialty item.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though its availability is usually restricted to late-game or post-game areas).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Porygon2** and traded to another trainer, the item triggers the holder's evolution into **Porygon-Z**. The item is consumed and vanishes once the evolution process is complete.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Deals moderate physical damage with no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item provides **no benefit in active combat**. In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), its only "utility" is the meta-game role of evolving Porygon2. Notably, Porygon2 is often considered more viable than its evolution due to the *Eviolite* boost, while Porygon-Z is used as a niche "Glass Cannon" wallbreaker with the ability *Adaptability*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is the second and final evolution-inducing item for the Porygon line, following the *Up-Grade*. It specifically targets the transition from the stable Porygon2 to the more erratic, high-powered Porygon-Z.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in locations associated with advanced technology or criminal organizations (such as the Team Galactic HQ, Aether Paradise, or the P2 Laboratory). In many regions, it is a reward for high-level trainers at **Battle Facilities** (Battle Frontier, Battle Tree) and must be purchased with Battle Points (BP) rather than standard currency. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It must be found in the overworld, gifted by NPCs, or purchased via specialized end-game vendors.
* **Lore Context:** The "dubious" nature of the data suggests that Porygon-Z is the result of an unauthorized or corrupted software update to Porygon2, explaining Porygon-Z's jittery animations and erratic behavior compared to its predecessors.
