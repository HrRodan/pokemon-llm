## Identity & Utility
**Soda Pop** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in **Generation I** (represented here in its Generation III data framework).
* **Description:** A highly carbonated soda drink used to patch up wounded Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** healing item that is **holdable** and can be used both **in-battle** and in the **overworld**. It serves as the mid-tier option in the "Vending Machine" beverage trio, positioned between Fresh Water and Lemonade.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores a fixed amount of HP to a single Pokémon. While traditionally restoring **60 HP** (as noted in its core effect entries), its potency was adjusted to **50 HP** starting in Generation VII (as reflected in the Sun/Moon flavor text).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Utility.** It is not used in professional VGC or Smogon formats, as it lacks a passive trigger. However, it is a staple for **Nuzlocke challenges** and general playthroughs because it offers a much better "HP-per-yen" ratio than Super Potions.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is compatible with the **Pickup** ability tables in various generations and can be given to a thirsty NPC at the Kanto Gatehouses in certain titles to gain access to Saffron City.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from **Vending Machines** located on the roofs of Department Stores (Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove) or in various transit hubs. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily an inventory-purchased item or a reward from specific NPCs (such as the Seven Stars Restaurant in Sinnoh or various beachside vendors). Unlike Potions, it is categorized as a "drink" rather than a "medicine," which occasionally affects its availability in certain specialty shops.
