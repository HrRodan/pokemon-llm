## Identity & Utility
**Yellow-tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's campsite during the Picnic mechanic. It is a **Consumable/Lifestyle** item that serves a purely aesthetic purpose, allowing players to personalize their environment while breeding Pokémon or crafting sandwiches.
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When active, it changes the visual appearance of the picnic table to a bright yellow pattern. This is a cosmetic-only effect and does not influence the "Sparkling Power" or other meal powers derived from sandwich making.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on combat, IVs, EVs, or move sets. It is strictly a "Flavor" item for overworld roleplay and customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic menu** interface introduced in *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at specialized lifestyle retail outlets within the Paldea region, specifically **Picnic Knacks** located in major hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is a commercial commodity intended for trainers focusing on the social and sandwich-making aspects of their journey. Unlike traditional held items, it is stored in the "Main Items" or "Picnic Item" pocket rather than the "Held Items" pocket.
