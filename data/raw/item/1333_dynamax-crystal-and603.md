## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (and603)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized event-exclusive consumable item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Corviknight**. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that remains active until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal value, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained through serial code distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to spawn a red beam of light. This allows the player to challenge a specific Gigantamax Pokémon in a Max Raid Battle. The encounter persists until the player wins or until midnight of the same day.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the item itself has no battle effect, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that possesses high IVs, a Hidden Ability, and the Gigantamax factor, all of which are staples in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon or interact with standard battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz. Its sole interaction is with the Watchtower Lair mechanic in Galar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal ("and603") was distributed via serial codes, often as a pre-order bonus or through retail partnerships (such as the CoroCoro Comic or specific steelbook editions of *Pokémon Sword and Shield*). It cannot be found through normal gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an event-tier reward.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique den that remains empty unless a Dynamax Crystal is dropped into it, acting as a beacon for powerful, localized Dynamax energy.
