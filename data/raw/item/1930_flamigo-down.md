## Identity & Utility
**Flamigo Down** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed or dropped by the Pokémon Flamigo. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a required component for crafting specific **Technical Machines (TMs)** at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers throughout the Paldea region.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held or used in battle. Its sole purpose is the acquisition of moves through the crafting system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly part of the Generation IX crafting economy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Flamigo**. It may also be found as a sparkling "hidden item" on the ground in areas where Flamigo congregate, such as wetlands, lakes, and coastal regions of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not technically a "held item" in the traditional sense (it cannot be stolen with Thief or Covet), it is guaranteed or highly likely to drop from wild **Flamigo** upon their defeat in battle or via the "Let's Go!" auto-battle mechanic.
