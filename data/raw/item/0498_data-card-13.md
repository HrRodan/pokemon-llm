## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 13** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** It is a specialized record-keeping tool used exclusively for the Pokéathlon. This card tracks "impediments"—specifically the number of times a trainer's own Pokémon have defeated themselves or hindered their own team during events. It is a **Key Item-style tracker** that cannot be bought with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale** via traditional Marts; acquired via alternative currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When accessed at the Pokéathlon Dome, it reveals the total count of "self-defeats" the trainer's Pokémon have accumulated. This includes instances like a Pokémon knocking itself out in *Ring Drop* or causing an own goal in *Goal Roll*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a flavor and completionist item for the Pokéathlon mini-game and has no utility in Smogon, VGC, or standard trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts solely with the **Pokéathlon** facility's data systems.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (Johto) from the Athlete Shop. It is bought using **Athlete Points (AP)** rather than Poké Dollars (specifically costing 500 AP). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital record tied to the trainer’s participation in Johto's athletic competitions.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of Data Cards (1 through 27), Card 13 is one of the more "infamous" stats, as it tracks the player's failures and mishaps rather than their victories.
