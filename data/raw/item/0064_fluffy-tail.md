## Identity & Utility
**Fluffy-tail** is a **Spelunking** item introduced in **Generation IV** (functioning as the Hoenn-region thematic equivalent to the Poké Doll).
* **Description:** A toy modeled after a Pokémon's tail (specifically Skitty's) that distracts wild opponents. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used during battle to guarantee safety.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during a wild Pokémon encounter, it **guarantees escape**, regardless of the player's Speed stat or the presence of trapping moves/abilities (such as *Mean Look*, *Arena Trap*, or *Shadow Tag*). It is consumed upon use and has no effect in Trainer battles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage only; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly a "quality of life" tool for the main storyline or Nuzlocke challenges to avoid dangerous wild encounters or "wobbuffet traps." It has no utility in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it is technically **holdable**, it provides no passive benefits to a Pokémon in combat. It does not trigger any evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Poké Marts and Department Stores. It is often positioned as a budget-friendly alternative to Repels for players who only wish to skip specific, high-threat encounters rather than all encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily acquired through purchase or as item pickups in the overworld, particularly in cave environments where "Spelunking" tools are most valuable.
