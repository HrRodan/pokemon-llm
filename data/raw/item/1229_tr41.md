## Identity & Utility
**TR41 (Blaze Kick)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that grants a Pokémon the move **Blaze Kick**. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, TRs are consumed upon use, making them a precious resource for physical attackers requiring Fire-type coverage.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive). In-game, these are primarily acquired via **Watts (W)** through Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Blaze Kick**. Blaze Kick is a high-risk, high-reward **Fire-type Physical move** with a Base Power of 85 and 90% Accuracy. It features an increased critical-hit ratio and a 10% chance to leave the target with a burn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 85. When used with the move **Fling**, it deals significant physical damage equivalent to the move's base power, though the item is consumed.
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly valued for physical attackers lacking natural Fire-type progression. It is a staple for Pokémon like **Blaziken**, **Cinderace**, and **Lucario**. Its high critical-hit ratio makes it particularly effective on teams utilizing "Crit-Me-Not" strategies or against defensive walls that have boosted their Defense stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility. It is a one-time consumable, meaning it disappears from the bag after teaching the move to one Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, TR41 is primarily obtained by defeating Fire-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price in Watts (usually 3,000–5,000 W). It can also be generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is an artificial record synthesized for training purposes. It is often farmed by players targeting Fire-type dens to optimize physical sweepers for the VGC (Video Game Championships) or Smogon competitive tiers.
