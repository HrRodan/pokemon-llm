## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cyg7949)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the encounter remains active until the end of the calendar day. It is a consumable item that cannot be purchased through standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal; primarily distributed via Serial Codes rather than retail).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific Pokémon Den in the Wild Area), it causes a pillar of light to appear, initiating a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (referenced by the internal ID `cyg7949`). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; it is strictly a single-player/co-op encounter mechanic for the main game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Using the crystal consumes it, and the resulting raid often provides unique rewards such as Exp. Candies, TRs, and a chance to catch a Pokémon with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax potential.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were historically distributed through **limited-time promotional events** (such as pre-order bonuses or retail distributions). They are not found in the overworld or sold by NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to the player's inventory as a promotional "Key-style" consumable.
