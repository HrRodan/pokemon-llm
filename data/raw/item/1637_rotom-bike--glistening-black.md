## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Bike (Glistening Black)** is a **Key Item Variant** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a specialized cosmetic and functional upgrade to the standard Rotom Bike. It utilizes a Rotom's power to provide high-speed land travel via a "Turbo Boost" and allows the rider to traverse bodies of water. The "Glistening Black" version is a premium aesthetic customization that emits a distinctive reddish-black shine. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates rapid overworld traversal. On land, the player can trigger a temporary speed burst (Turbo). Once the Water Mode is unlocked (via story progression), the bike automatically deploys pontoons to allow movement across the surface of the water, replacing the need for the "Surf" HM/move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is strictly an overworld utility item used for exploration and travel; it has no application in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. However, it represents the fusion of technology and Pokémon (Rotom), a recurring theme in the Galar region's infrastructure.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, specifically within the **Isle of Armor** expansion. Players can obtain this specific "Glistening Black" color scheme by speaking to the **Bike Surgeon** located near the Master Dojo. The Surgeon offers to customize the bike's appearance and the player's biking outfit to match this specific color profile.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is unique to the player character and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** The Rotom Bike is the primary mode of transportation in Galar. The Glistening Black variant is considered a "top-tier" aesthetic upgrade, reflecting the player's progress and exploration of the Armor Island.
