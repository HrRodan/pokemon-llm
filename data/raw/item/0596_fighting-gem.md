## Identity & Utility
**Fighting Gem** is a **Jewel** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A single-use, consumable held item infused with the essence of combat. It is designed to provide a one-time, significant power boost to a Fighting-type attack. While it has a low nominal cost, it is historically a rare find rather than a common shop item.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though typically found via exploration rather than purchased in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Fighting-type move, the move's power is increased by **1.5×** (in Generation V) or **1.3×** (in Generation VI and onward). The item is consumed immediately upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **high-impact niche item**. In its debut (Gen V), it was a staple for offensive threats like **Terrakion** or **Breloom** to secure OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) that would otherwise be impossible. It is exceptionally powerful when paired with the ability **Unburden** (e.g., on **Hitmonlee** or **Hawlucha**), as the consumption of the gem simultaneously boosts damage and doubles the Pokémon's Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with move-boosting mechanics and consumption-based abilities like **Unburden**, **Harvest**, or **Pickup**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically acquired through **Dust Clouds** in caves across the Unova region. In later generations, elemental gems like the Fighting Gem became significantly harder to obtain, often being excluded from standard gameplay in favor of the Normal Gem or restricted to specific Battle Facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not currently known to be held by wild Pokémon in the core series games; it must typically be farmed through environmental mechanics or won as a prize.
