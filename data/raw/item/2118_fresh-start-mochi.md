## Identity & Utility
**Fresh-Start Mochi** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically in the *The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** A specialized local snack from the Kitakami region that serves as a total "hard reset" for a Pokémon’s base points. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily obtained through regional activities rather than standard Mart purchases.
* **Cost:** 75 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, its value lies in its rarity as a reward rather than its purchase price, which is rarely applicable in standard shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a Pokémon, it **completely resets all Effort Values (EVs)** to zero across every stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Consumable medicine).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Meta-Enabler.** This is a critical tool for competitive players. It allows a trainer to take a Pokémon used during a casual playthrough (which has "messy" EVs from various wild encounters) and perfectly re-optimize its stats for VGC or Smogon formats without needing to use dozens of EV-reducing berries (like Pomeg or Kelpsy Berries).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a training correction tool. Unlike the "Reset Urge" NPC in the Gen VIII DLC, this is a portable, stackable item, making team building much more efficient.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily earned as a reward for playing the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame in Kitakami. It is often a reward for completing higher difficulty tiers (Normal and Hard).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a handcrafted specialty of the Mossui Town community.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of stat-management, while traditional Vitamins (Protein, Iron, etc.) add 10 EVs and Berries subtract 10, the Fresh-Start Mochi is the only item capable of a **total wipe**, making it the most powerful EV-management tool in the series to date.
