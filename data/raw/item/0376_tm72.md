## Identity & Utility
**TM72** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A data-disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. This item has historically represented two distinct moves: **Avalanche** (Generation IV) and **Volt Switch** (Generation V through VIII). It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the generation) that can be purchased for a high price.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium Acquisition**). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Legacy (Gen IV):** Teaches **Avalanche**, a Physical Ice-type move that deals double damage if the user was hit by the opponent earlier in the same turn.
    * **Modern (Gen V+):** Teaches **Volt Switch**, a Special Electric-type move that switches the user out for another Pokémon in the party immediately after dealing damage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling or have no base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Avalanche:** Niche use on bulky Ice-types or physical attackers like Mamoswine and Avalugg who can afford to move second.
        * **Volt Switch:** A **Competitive Staple**. It is one of the most important moves in singles and doubles for maintaining "momentum," allowing a trainer to damage the opponent and switch to a counter-pick in a single turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited to Pokémon with compatible movepools.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Due to its high cost (50,000 Poké Dollars), it is typically found in late-game Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City, Shopping Mall Nine, or Wyndon) or provided as a reward for defeating high-tier Gym Leaders (notably Elesa in Gen V).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured human technology, though in recent generations like **Scarlet & Violet**, it can be crafted at a TM Machine using materials gathered from wild Pokémon.
