## Identity & Utility
**Coin Case** is a **Key Item** (categorized under Gameplay) introduced in **Generation III** (with variants appearing in Generations I and II).
* **Description:** A specialized storage container designed to hold currency used exclusively within Game Corner facilities. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**. It is an essential progression item for players wishing to engage in gambling minigames or trade for prize-tier rewards.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows the player to carry and accumulate Coins earned or purchased at the Game Corner. It has a strict capacity limit, capable of holding a **maximum of 50,000 coins**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item is strictly for overworld utility and economy management within the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, the coins stored within are often the only way to acquire high-value **Evolution Items** (like the Moon Stone or Porygon's Up-Grade) and powerful **TMs** (such as Ice Beam, Thunderbolt, or Flamethrower) in certain generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically gifted to the player by an NPC located in or near a city with a Game Corner (e.g., Mauville City in Hoenn, Celadon City in Kanto, or Goldenrod City in Johto). In the Johto region, the Coin Case is famously associated with an "Arbitrary Code Execution" (ACE) glitch in early hardware versions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item that cannot be traded or discarded.
* **Legacy Note:** In modern Pokémon titles (Generation IV remakes and onward), the Game Corner was removed or repurposed due to changes in international rating standards regarding gambling, making the Coin Case a legacy item from the series' early history.
