## Identity & Utility
**Binding Band** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that increases the potency of "binding" or trapping moves. It is a specialized combat accessory designed for tactical attrition strategies. It is a **Held Item** that can typically be purchased at Battle Facilities or specialty shops.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range price**; often acquired via BP in post-game areas).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the end-of-turn residual damage inflicted by multi-turn trapping moves. Specifically, it increases the damage from **1/8th (12.5%)** of the target's maximum HP to **1/6th (approx 16.7%)** of the target's maximum HP each turn.
    * *Applicable Moves:* Bind, Wrap, Fire Spin, Whirlpool, Clamp, Sand Tomb, Magma Storm, Infestation, and Snap Trap.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard low-tier damage; no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Tactical Staple.** While items like *Leftovers* or *Life Orb* are more common, the Binding Band is a core component of "Trap and Stall" sets. It is particularly effective on Pokémon that utilize **Magma Storm (Heatran)** or **Infestation (Shuckle/Toxapex)** to accelerate "chip damage" while preventing the opponent from switching out.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It synergizes effectively with the **Grip Claw** (which extends the duration of trapping moves), though a Pokémon can only hold one item at a time. It also pairs well with abilities that prevent switching or moves like *Toxic*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in post-game locations such as the **Battle Subway (Gen V)**, **Battle Maison (Gen VI)**, or the **Stow-on-Side Bargain Shop (Gen VIII)**. In many regions, it must be exchanged for Battle Points (BP) rather than standard currency.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically found** on wild Pokémon (0 recorded instances in the provided data). It is considered a manufactured technical item rather than a natural occurrence, requiring the player to seek out specialized vendors or competitive rewards.
