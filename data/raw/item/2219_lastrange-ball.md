## Identity & Utility
**Lastrange-ball** is a **Specialty Poké Ball** introduced in an **Unknown Generation** (typically associated with specific fan-made projects or ROM hacks such as *Pokémon Last Range*).
* **Description:** As a member of the "standard-balls" category, it is a specialized device designed for the capture of wild Pokémon. Given its specific naming convention and lack of standard retail data, it functions as a **Key or Scripted capture tool** rather than a standard consumable found in official Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This indicates the item is likely obtained through specific story events, NPC gifts, or as a starting item within its respective game environment.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While specific catch rate modifiers are not defined in the provided data, as a Poké Ball, its primary function is to be used from the combat bag to attempt a capture on a wild Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item does not exist in the official Nintendo/Game Freak competitive formats (VGC or Smogon). It is intended for use within a specific single-player "playthrough" context.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any known evolutions. It is treated as a standard capture projectile within the game engine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in standard Poké Marts or through traditional gameplay in the core series games. It is likely a **unique acquisition** tied to the narrative of the specific mod or region it originates from.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally a player-only utility item. 
* **Context:** The "Lastrange-ball" represents a custom asset, likely used to signify a specific faction, a modified catch rate for high-difficulty encounters, or as a signature item for the "Last Range" fan-game universe.
