## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PEG8634)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. It is designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair. Once activated, the designated Pokémon remains available for encounter until the end of the calendar day. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Placeholder cost; typically distributed via serial codes and not sold in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone structure in the East Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it beam-activates a Max Raid Battle. The specific Pokémon appearing is determined by the crystal's ID (PEG8634).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a utility item for the overworld. However, it is competitively relevant for **acquisition**, as these crystals often guarantee encounters with Pokémon possessing Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "Max Raid" encounter trigger. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are rare, limited-access items. They were primarily distributed through **promotional serial codes** (such as those found in the Pokémon Sword & Shield Dual Pack or through retailers like GameStop/Target). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an event-exclusive item that cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or standard gameplay loops.
* **Lore Context:** These crystals act as highly concentrated sources of Galar Particles, forcing a specific Pokémon to Dynamax at a localized point (the Watchtower Lair) regardless of the natural raid cycle of the Wild Area.
