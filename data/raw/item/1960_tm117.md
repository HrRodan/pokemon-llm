## Identity & Utility
**TM117 (Taunt)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the move **Taunt** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea region and the Blueberry Academy (Indigo Disk), TMs are single-use consumables but can be replicated using a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, this item cannot be bought with standard currency; it must be found in the overworld or crafted using 3,000 League Points (LP), Meowth Fur (x3), and Sableye Gems (x3).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Taunt**. Taunt is a Dark-type status move that prevents the target from using any non-attacking moves (Status moves) for three turns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility/Competitive Staple.** Taunt is one of the most vital moves in both VGC and Smogon singles. It is used to "shut down" defensive walls, hazard setters (Stealth Rock/Spikes), and setup sweepers (Dragon Dance/Calm Mind). It is particularly effective on "Prankster" ability users like Murkrow or Grimmsnarl to ensure priority disruption.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a vast majority of Pokémon, particularly those with aggressive or "mischievous" lore.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Overworld:** Found as a collectible item in various locations across Paldea (notably the West Province).
    * **TM Machine:** Once obtained, it can be crafted infinitely at any Pokémon Center or the Terarium, provided the trainer has the required materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** TMs are never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft TM117 are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Meowth**, **Persian**, and **Sableye**.
