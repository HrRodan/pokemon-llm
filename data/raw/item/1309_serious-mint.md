## Identity & Utility
**Serious Mint** is a **Nature-Mint** (Medicine) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item that alters a Pokémon's stat growth. When used, it ensures that all of the Pokémon's stats (Attack, Defense, Speed, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def) grow at an equal rate. It is a **Consumable** item that modifies growth patterns without changing the Pokémon's original Nature name.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**). *Note: While the data lists 20, in-game these are typically high-value items purchased with Battle Points (BP) or found as rare rewards.*

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the Pokémon's stat modifiers to match the **Serious** nature. It removes any existing 10% buffs or debuffs to stats, resulting in a neutral growth spread where no stat is favored or hindered.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Quality of Life.** While Nature Mints are "Competitive Staples" for optimizing Pokémon, the **Serious Mint** is rarely used in high-level play. Competitive builds usually require maximizing one specific stat (like Speed or Attack) at the expense of another. This mint is used primarily to "neutralize" a Pokémon that has a detrimental nature when a specialized one isn't desired.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts purely with the Pokémon's stat calculation formula. It is highly valued for "fixing" the stats of Shiny Pokémon or Legendaries that were caught with sub-optimal natures.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found at end-game locations such as the **Battle Tower** (Gen VIII) or **Chansey Supply** shops (Gen IX). It can also be obtained as a reward from high-level **Tera Raid Battles** or found as a rare hidden item in open-world areas like the Wild Area or Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is an artificial or highly rare botanical specimen used specifically by Trainers for professional Pokémon conditioning.
