## Identity & Utility
**Dark-gem** is a **Jewel (Type-Enhancing Gem)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A gem imbued with an essence of darkness. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that provides a significant, one-time power boost to a specific move type. While it has a listed cost, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts, typically functioning as a specialized find.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, but acquisition is usually limited to exploration or hidden item mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging **Dark-type move**, the power of that move is increased by **1.5×** (in Gen V) or **1.3×** (in Gen VI+). Upon activation, the gem is **consumed** and disappears from the holder's inventory for the remainder of the battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 0 (In most metadata, Gems cannot be effectively Flung for damage, though they can be consumed before the move resolves).
    * **Competitive Use:** In Generation V, Gems were **top-tier competitive staples**, used to turn narrow 2HKOs (two-hit knockouts) into OHKOs (one-hit knockouts). The Dark Gem is particularly effective on "nuke" attackers like Tyranitar or Hydreigon using *Pursuit* or *Draco Meteor/Crunch* combos. 
    * **Synergy:** It is a premier trigger for the **Unburden** ability (e.g., on Purloin or Liepard), as it consumes itself automatically upon attacking, instantly doubling the user's Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is ignored by the ability **Klutz**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in **Dust Clouds** within caves across the Unova region (e.g., Wellspring Cave, Chargestone Cave). In later generations, most elemental gems (including the Dark Gem) became incredibly rare or unavailable in standard gameplay, often restricted to special events or specific battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly held by wild Pokémon; it is traditionally gathered via environmental exploration or the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets (depending on the game version).
* **Lore:** Representing the distilled energy of the shadows, it is part of a cycle of eighteen gems corresponding to each elemental type, used by trainers to provide a tactical "burst" of power.
