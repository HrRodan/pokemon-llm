## Identity & Utility
**TR97 (Psychic Fangs)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. This TR contains **Psychic Fangs**, a physical Psychic-type attack that shatters defensive barriers. Unlike standard TMs in its debut generation, TRs are consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Special Acquisition**). In its native Galar region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Fangs** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Power: 85 | Accuracy: 100% | Type: Psychic | Category: Physical.
    * **Special Property:** It removes the effects of **Reflect**, **Light Screen**, and **Aurora Veil** from the target's side of the field before dealing damage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 85 (Deals significant physical damage if the item is thrown using the move Fling, though the TR is destroyed).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly valuable for physical attackers like **Metagross**, **Zacian**, and **Bruxish**. It is a premier "anti-screen" utility move used in VGC and Smogon formats to punish teams relying on Grimmsnarl or Alolan Ninetales for defensive setup.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with the Ability **Strong Jaw**, which boosts the power of this move by 50% because it is classified as a "biting" move.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword & Shield**. It is commonly found as a reward for defeating Psychic-type or high-tier Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area on a rotating daily inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured technical record. However, the move it teaches is the signature trait of Pokémon with powerful dental anatomy or telekinetic biting capabilities.
