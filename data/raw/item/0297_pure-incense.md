## Identity & Utility
**Pure Incense** is a **Training/Incense** item introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** An aromatic incense to be held by a Pokémon. When the holder is at the front of the party, it acts as a passive deterrent, keeping lower-leveled wild Pokémon from attacking. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**; standard pricing for specialized incense items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is the first Pokémon in the party, the encounter rate of wild Pokémon with a lower level than the holder is reduced by 50%. This mirrors the effect of the **Cleanse Tag**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; provides no additional effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Competitive.** It has no utility in Trainer battles or VGC/Smogon formats, as its primary function is restricted to overworld exploration and breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Breeding Trigger:** This item is essential for obtaining **Chingling**. When a **Chimecho** is placed in the Day Care or Nursery while holding Pure Incense, the resulting Egg will contain a Chingling. Without this item, Chimecho will produce a Chimecho Egg.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in specialized markets, such as the **Slateport City** market (Hoenn) or the **incense merchant** in various regions (e.g., Route 9 in Sinnoh or Hulbury in Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held** by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or found as a static item in the overworld. Unlike items like the Silk Scarf, it cannot be reliably farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief** in the wild.
