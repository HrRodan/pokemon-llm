## Identity & Utility
**Adrenaline Orb** is a **Competitive Held Item** and **Battle Utility** item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized orb that heightens a Pokémon's reactive instincts. It serves a dual purpose: in the wild, it agitates opponents to summon help; in competitive battles, it triggers a rush of speed when the holder is threatened. It is a **consumable** item that is consumed upon activation in battle.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**). While accessible in the mid-to-late game, the cost is significant for a single-use consumable.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** 
    * **Wild Battles:** When used from the bag, it makes the wild Pokémon more likely to call for allies (SOS Battles). This effect lasts for the duration of the battle and does not need to be used again if the summon fails.
    * **Held Effect:** If the holder is affected by the **Intimidate** ability, the Adrenaline Orb is consumed to increase the holder's **Speed by one stage (+1)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **niche meta-counter** in VGC and Smogon formats. It is primarily used to punish "Intimidate-cycling" strategies (common with Pokémon like Incineroar or Landorus-T). By gaining a +1 Speed boost immediately upon entry, a Pokémon can outspeed threats it would otherwise be slower than, potentially securing a crucial KO.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Intimidate** ability. It will not trigger if the holder has an ability that prevents stat drops (like Clear Body) unless the Speed boost is the primary goal and the Intimidate check still occurs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available for purchase at **Pokémon Centers** in later-game locations (such as Alola's Route 13 or post-trial Marts). In subsequent generations, it is usually found in specialized shops like the Delibird Presents in Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or found as overworld loot.
* **Context:** In its debut generation (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), the Adrenaline Orb was the cornerstone of **Shiny Hunting** and **EV Training**, as SOS Battles were the primary method for finding rare Pokémon with high IVs and Hidden Abilities.
