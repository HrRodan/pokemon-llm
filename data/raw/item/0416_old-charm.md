## Identity & Utility
**Old Charm** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient good-luck charm fashioned from Pokémon bones. It is a mandatory **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. Its sole purpose is to be delivered to the Elder of Celestic Town.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Old Charm serves as a narrative gatekeeper. When delivered to Cynthia’s grandmother (the Elder of Celestic Town) after clearing the Team Galactic event in the town, it triggers a dialogue sequence that grants the player access to the **Surf HM** (traditionally HM03 in the Sinnoh region).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for story progression and cannot be used in any competitive battle format (Smogon/VGC).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. Its "interaction" is strictly with the NPC Cynthia’s grandmother to advance the game's main questline.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained directly from **Cynthia** after the player helps her or her family, specifically following the confrontation with Team Galactic. It acts as a request from Cynthia for the player to visit her hometown.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The item highlights the deep history of the Sinnoh region and the lineage of Cynthia. The fact that it is made of "Pokémon bones" reflects the ancient traditions found in the Sinnoh Myths, suggesting a time when the relationship between humans and Pokémon was viewed through a more primal, spiritual lens.
