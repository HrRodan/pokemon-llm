## Identity & Utility
**Swift-wing** is a **Vitamin** (specifically a "Wing" sub-type) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A consumable medicine used to enhance a Pokémon's potential. Unlike traditional high-yield vitamins like Carbos, the Swift-wing provides a granular increase to stats. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally **obtainable through exploration or specialized shops**.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a single Pokémon's **Speed Effort Values (EVs) by 1**. It is used by trainers who require precision when "EV Training" a Pokémon to reach specific speed tiers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low damage; no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Relevant for Fine-Tuning.** While Carbos provides +10 EVs, Swift-wings are used to reach exact numbers (e.g., if a build requires 244 Speed EVs instead of 252). Prior to Generation VIII, wings were also unique because they could be used even if a Pokémon had more than 100 EVs in a stat, whereas traditional vitamins were capped.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use and cannot be used if the Pokémon's Speed EVs are already maxed (252) or if the total EV cap (510) has been reached.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Unova (Gen V):** Found as "shadows" on the Driftveil Drawbridge and Marvelous Bridge. 
    * **Galar/Paldea (Gen VIII/IX):** Often found as sparkling dropped items in the overworld, awarded from Tera Raid Battles, or purchased at specialized markets (like the Porto Marinada auctions).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through environmental exploration or as a reward for peripheral activities (like the Wings found via **Pickup** in certain game versions).
