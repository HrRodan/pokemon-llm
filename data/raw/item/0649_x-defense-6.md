## Identity & Utility
**X Defense 6** is a **Miracle Shooter (Battle Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An advanced variant of the standard X Defense. It is a specialized battle consumable that raises a Pokémon's Defense stat to its maximum potential in a single turn. It is not a physical item held in the player's bag for overworld use; rather, it is a digital/temporary item accessible only within the **Wonder Launcher** battle mechanic.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired exclusively by spending points accumulated during turns in Wonder Launcher-enabled battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used, it instantly raises the target Pokémon's **Defense stat by six stages** (+300%). This effectively maxes out the physical damage mitigation for that Pokémon immediately. Like all "X" items, the effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out or if the battle ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Niche Gimmick).** This item is barred from standard VGC and Smogon competitive formats as it relies on the Generation V Wonder Launcher sub-mechanic. It was designed for a specific "power-up" style of multiplayer play that has not returned in subsequent generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with standard abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is a pure mechanic-specific consumable.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Only available in **Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2** during link battles where the "Wonder Launcher" setting is enabled. Players must wait until they have accumulated enough points (based on turns elapsed) to "buy" the boost mid-battle.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon**. It does not exist in the standard item database for overworld exploration or NPC shops, making it one of the most restricted battle items in the franchise's history.
