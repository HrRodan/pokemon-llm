## Identity & Utility
**Sweet Herba Mystica** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A rare, legendary condiment found within the Paldea region. It is a specialized culinary and medicinal item used exclusively in the **Picnic** mechanic to craft high-tier Sandwiches. It is a **Consumable Rare Resource** that **Cannot** be purchased from any standard Poké Mart or Delibird Presents.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Priceless**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as an ingredient in a sandwich, it provides a massive boost to **Meal Powers**. It is primarily used to achieve **Level 3 Meal Powers**, the highest tier available. Its "Sweet" profile specifically influences the resulting sandwich's secondary effects, often contributing to **Egg Power**, **Catching Power**, or **Raid Power** depending on the recipe combination.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no direct utility in VGC or Smogon Smog-style battles, it is a **Metagame Staple** for "Shiny Hunting." Combining two Herba Mystica (including Sweet) allows players to activate **Sparkling Power Level 3**, which drastically increases the odds of encountering Shiny Pokémon in the wild.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve Pokémon directly, but it is a core component of the "Path of Legends" storyline, where it is consumed by the box legendary (**Koraidon/Miraidon**) to restore its traversal abilities (Sprinting, Swimming, Gliding).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an endgame reward. It can only be obtained as a rare random drop from **5-Star and 6-Star Tera Raid Battles**. Certain Pokémon, such as **Blissey**, **Amoonguss**, **Cetitan**, and **Dondozo**, have a higher statistical probability of dropping Sweet Herba Mystica.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is considered a legendary botanical treasure guarded by **Titan Pokémon** (specifically the Stony Cliff Titan, Klawf, in the narrative context). In the post-game, players must farm high-level Tera Raids to accumulate stock for shiny hunting and title hunting.
