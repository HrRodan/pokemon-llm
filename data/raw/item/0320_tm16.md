## Identity & Utility
**TM16** is a **Technical Machine** classified under the **All-Machines** category. While this specific entry is indexed within Generation III, it represents a long-standing instructional tool in the Pokémon series.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In its most prominent and modern iterations (Gen III–IX), it teaches the move **Light Screen**. It is a **Consumable** or **Reusable** item (depending on the generation) that is generally **Accessible** through purchase or exploration.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Light Screen** to a compatible Pokémon. Light Screen creates a mystical wall of energy that halves damage from Special Attacks for five turns (reduced to a 1/3 reduction in Double Battles).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling, or provide 0 power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Light Screen is a core component of "Dual Screens" strategies. It is essential for lead Pokémon (like Grimmsnarl or Klefki) and bulky supports to mitigate damage for the rest of the team. Its utility is significantly enhanced when the user holds a **Light Clay**, extending the effect from five turns to eight.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Teaching this move does not trigger evolution. Move compatibility is highest among Psychic, Fairy, and Electric-type Pokémon, as well as many "bulky" Normal types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM16 is traditionally one of the most accessible TMs in the franchise. It is frequently sold at **Large Department Stores** (such as the Celadon Dept. Store, Goldenrod Dept. Store, or Lilycove Dept. Store). In newer regions like Paldea (Gen IX), it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Historical Context:** TM16 is unique for having different contents in the earliest generations:
    * **Gen I:** Contained **Pay Day**.
    * **Gen II:** Contained **Icy Wind**.
    * **Gen III–Present:** Consistently teaches **Light Screen**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon; primarily obtained via shops, gift NPCs, or overworld item balls.
