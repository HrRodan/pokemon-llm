## Identity & Utility
**TR29 (Baton Pass)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item used to teach a Pokémon the move **Baton Pass**. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) break after use, requiring the trainer to acquire multiple copies for multiple Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Baton Pass** to a compatible Pokémon. This move allows the user to switch places with a party member, transferring all temporary stat modifications (increases or decreases to Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.), a **Substitute** (if active), and certain volatile status effects (like **Aqua Ring** or **Leech Seed**) to the incoming Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; generally not a viable strategy for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact/Strategic Staple.** Baton Pass is one of the most influential moves in competitive history. It is the cornerstone of "Baton Pass Chains" or "Setup Pass" strategies, where a bulky Pokémon boosts its stats (e.g., via *Shell Smash* or *Swords Dance*) and then passes them to a powerful "Sweeper." Due to its potential to become "unbreakable," it is often restricted or banned in various Smogon formats, though it remains a tactical choice in VGC (Double Battles).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR29 is primarily obtained from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (inventory rotates daily) or as a reward for defeating Psychic-type or Normal-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured mechanical record for move instruction.
