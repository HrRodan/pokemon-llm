## Identity & Utility
**Leaf Stone** is an **Evolution Item** rooted in the series' history, recognized as a staple for Grass-type development.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone bearing an unmistakable leaf pattern. It is a **Consumable** item that is used from the bag on a specific Pokémon in the overworld to trigger immediate evolution. It cannot be used during a battle and is consumed upon successful evolution.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Accessible**). It is generally available for purchase at major Department Stores in most regions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the evolution of several Grass-type species. According to current data, it facilitates the following transformations:
    * **Exeggcute** → Exeggutor
    * **Gloom** → Vileplume
    * **Nuzleaf** → Shiftry
    * **Pansage** → Simisage
    * **Weepinbell** → Victreebel
    * *(World Knowledge Note: Also evolves Hisuian Voltorb into Hisuian Electrode in modern titles).*
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; provides no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no utility in a competitive held-item slot, it is **essential for team building**, as many of its evolutions (like Venusaur-alternatives or Sun-team staples like Victreebel) require it to reach their final, viable base stat totals.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically targeted by the **"Underground"** attribute, meaning it is a common find in the Sinnoh Underground and Grand Underground mining mini-games.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in large retail hubs (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, or Lumiose City). In the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), it is most frequently acquired by digging in the **Underground**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon** (0% encounter rate in this dataset). Trainers must rely on shop purchases, overworld item balls, or environmental mechanics like mining and the **Pickup** ability (at specific high-level tiers in certain games) to obtain it.
* **Context:** It represents one of the original "Elemental Stones" introduced in the Kanto region, serving as the primary bottleneck for unlocking the potential of early-game Grass types.
