## Identity & Utility
**Zinc** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation II**.
* **Description:** A nutritious drink formulated for Pokémon. It is a high-tier consumable used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's defensive capabilities. While it is technically "holdable," it is designed to be used from the bag to provide immediate stat growth. 
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price reflects its status as a premium training shortcut for end-game or competitive preparation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon’s **Special Defense Effort Values (EVs)** by 10. 
    * *Mechanical Nuance:* In games prior to Generation VIII, it cannot be used if the Pokémon already has 100 or more Special Defense EVs. From Generation VIII onwards, it can be used until the stat is maxed out at 252 EVs. 
    * *Happiness:* Using Zinc also provides a small boost to the Pokémon's friendship/happiness (5/3/2 depending on current happiness levels).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Training Tool.** While never held in actual competitive matches, Zinc is a staple for "Vitamin Training," allowing players to skip hours of manual EV grinding against wild Pokémon to achieve a specific defensive "spread."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Because it increases happiness, it can be used to accelerate the evolution of Pokémon that evolve via friendship (e.g., Chansey, Eevee, or Riolu).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at major **Department Stores** (such as those in Celadon, Goldenrod, or Veilstone City) and specialized Medicine Shops. In modern titles, it is frequently available via Battle Points (BP) vendors or the Rotom ID Lottery.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a common reward found via the **Pickup** ability, typically appearing in the high-level loot tables (Level 71-100) of Pokémon like Meowth, Ambipom, or Munchlax.
