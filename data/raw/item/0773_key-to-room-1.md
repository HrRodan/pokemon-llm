## Identity & Utility
**Key to Room 1** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VI** (though metadata persists through Generation VII).
* **Description:** A specialized key used to unlock a specific door within the derelict facility known as Sea Mauville. As a Key Item, it is categorized for plot advancement and is neither consumable nor holdable by Pokémon. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest item that cannot be bought, sold, or traded.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When in the player's possession, it grants access to **Room 1** in the Sea Mauville sub-area. Unlocking this room is a mandatory step in a sequential scavenger hunt within the ship to uncover its history and hidden treasures.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld exploration and story progression within the Hoenn region (ORAS).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It is part of a "Key Chain" sequence; finding the Key to Room 1 typically leads to finding the Key to Room 2, and so on, eventually leading to the **Scanner** or high-value TMs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the interior of **Sea Mauville** (the remade Abandoned Ship in *Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*). It is typically found by interacting with sparkling spots or NPCs within the accessible areas of the ship's wreckage.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** Sea Mauville was once a high-tech facility owned by Greater Mauville Holdings. The various room keys represent the restricted access once enforced within the facility before its decommissioning and subsequent environmental protection status as a nature preserve. Progressing through these rooms is necessary to encounter the legendary Pokémon **Lugia** (in *Alpha Sapphire*) or **Ho-Oh** (in *Omega Ruby*).
