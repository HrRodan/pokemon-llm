## Identity & Utility
**TM216 (Hard Press)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC)**.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Hard Press**. It is a single-use consumable in Generation IX, though it can be reproduced once the recipe is unlocked. As a TM, it is part of the "All Machines" category, specifically designated for the expansion of the movepool in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In the context of the Paldea/Blueberry Academy economy, this item is acquired via exploration or crafted at a **TM Machine** using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hard Press** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Hard Press Mechanics:** A Physical Steel-type move. The power of this move is calculated based on the target's remaining HP. The formula is approximately $100 \times (\text{Current HP} / \text{Max HP})$, meaning it deals maximum damage when the opponent is at full health and weakens as the opponent's HP decreases.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling in recent generations, or provide minimal power).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. It is a reliable Steel-type physical attack for Pokémon that do not have access to *Iron Head* or *Heavy Slam*. It is particularly effective for "wall-breaking" against healthy targets but loses utility in the late game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be crafted repeatedly at any TM Machine once the player has obtained the original TM or defeated the necessary trainers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM216 is located within the **Blueberry Academy Terarium** (specifically the Canyon Plaza area or as a reward for defeating certain BB League trainers). 
* **Crafting Requirements:** To craft TM216 at a TM Machine, the player typically requires:
    * **8,000 LP**
    * **Skarmory Feathers** (x5)
    * **Magnemite Screws** (x3)
    * **Beldum Nails** (x3)
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a human-made device for move distribution. It is most commonly associated with Steel-type specialists within the Indigo Disk expansion.
