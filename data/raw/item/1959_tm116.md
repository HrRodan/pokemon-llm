## Identity & Utility
**TM116 (Stealth Rock)** is a **Technical Machine** categorized under **All-Machines**, specifically associated with the **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)** TM numbering system.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach the move **Stealth Rock** to a compatible Pokémon. In the context of the Paldea region, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, it is acquired through crafting at the TM Machine rather than direct purchase with currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Stealth Rock**. When used in battle, the user lays a trap of stones around the opposing team. Opponents switching into battle take Rock-type damage based on their type weakness/resistance to Rock (ranging from 3.125% to 50% of their maximum HP).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** Stealth Rock is arguably the most influential entry hazard in the history of competitive Pokémon (Smogon and VGC). It is essential for breaking **Focus Sashes** and **Sturdy** abilities, and it severely punishes frequent switching, particularly against types like Fire, Ice, Bug, and Flying.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. The move it teaches interacts specifically with the **Heavy-Duty Boots** held item (which negates the damage) and can be removed by moves like **Rapid Spin**, **Defog**, **Mortal Spin**, or **Tidy Up**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available at the **TM Machine** in Pokémon Centers across the Paldea region. It can also be found as a collectible item on the ground in various rocky or mountainous locations (such as the East Province).
* **Crafting Requirements:** To craft TM116 in *Scarlet & Violet*, a trainer typically requires:
    * **5,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Nacli Salt**
    * **3x Rolycoly Coal**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured tool for trainers.
