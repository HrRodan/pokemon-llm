## Identity & Utility
**Tadbulb Mucus** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological byproduct collected from members of the Tadbulb evolutionary line. It serves as a specialized crafting component used at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts, though it can be sold for a small amount of currency.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Material Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item acts as a specific ingredient required to craft various Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to synthesize moves for their Pokémon's movepool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy and move-teaching mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While not an evolution stone, it is a direct marker of the **Tadbulb and Bellibolt** lineage. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional held-item capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea region**. It is acquired as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon from the Tadbulb family. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a "held item" in the traditional sense, but it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Tadbulb** and **Bellibolt**. It can also be obtained as a reward from **Tera Raid Battles** featuring these Pokémon. In the Paldean ecosystem, it represents the specialized mucus these electric-type amphibians use to generate and conduct electricity.
