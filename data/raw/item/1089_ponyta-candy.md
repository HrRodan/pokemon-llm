## Identity & Utility
**Ponyta Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A specialized energy-dense treat used to bolster the growth of the Ponyta evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is primarily used to bypass traditional training methods to instantly enhance a Pokémon's potential.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low sell value, its utility in the "Awakening" system makes it far more valuable than its price suggests.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Ponyta** or **Rapidash** (including their Kantonian and Galarian forms, though primarily utilized in the LGPE engine), it increases all of the Pokémon's stats—HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed—by **1 point** simultaneously. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in the games where it appears).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. In those games, stacking Species Candy is the most efficient way to reach the maximum of 200 AVs in every stat, making it mandatory for "No Restrictions" competitive play within that ecosystem. It has no effect in standard VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Rare Candies, this does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancer. It works exclusively on the **Ponyta** evolutionary family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not typically purchased at Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired through the **Pokémon Storage System** by transferring caught Ponyta to Professor Oak, or as a reward for achieving high **Catch Combos** of wild Ponyta.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is "farmed" by repeatedly catching wild **Ponyta** or **Rapidash**. In the context of *Let's Go*, this represents the essence or specialized nutrition required to push a specific species to its physical peak.
