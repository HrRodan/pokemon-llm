## Identity & Utility
**Modest Mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable herb that, when used on a Pokémon, alters its stat growth patterns to match the **Modest** nature. It allows a Pokémon to prioritize its **Special Attack** at the expense of its physical **Attack**. While it changes the stat modifiers, it does *not* change the Pokémon's actual inherent nature (important for breeding or flavor-based mechanics). 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Note: In the raw data, this value is low; however, in-game context identifies this as a high-value item typically sold for **20,000 Poké Dollars** or **50 BP** at specialized endgame shops like the Battle Tower or Chansey's Supply).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently adjusts the Pokémon's stat multipliers. The Pokémon’s **Special Attack** growth is increased by 10%, while its physical **Attack** growth is decreased by 10%. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low impact; using Fling with a Mint is generally suboptimal).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High / Essential.** This is a premier Quality of Life (QoL) item for competitive play. It allows trainers to optimize "Shiny" Pokémon, Legendaries, or gift Pokémon that were obtained with the wrong nature, making them viable for VGC or Smogon formats without the need for breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Stat Overrides:** Unlike traditional natures, using a Modest Mint will not change which flavor of Berry a Pokémon prefers or dislikes; that remains tied to its original nature.
    * **Breeding:** If a Pokémon has used a Modest Mint, it will still pass down its *original* nature when holding an **Everstone**, not the Modest modifiers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available in the post-game. In Sword/Shield, it is purchased from the **Battle Tower** for BP. In Scarlet/Violet, it is widely available at **Chansey's Supply** outlets once the player has progressed through enough Gym badges. It can also be found as a rare sparkling pickup in the **Wild Area** or **Area Zero**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured or rare botanical item reserved for specialized training. It serves as a bridge between casual playthroughs and the rigorous requirements of high-level competitive battling.
