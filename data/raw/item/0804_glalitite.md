## Identity & Utility
**Glalitite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically during the Hoenn remakes, Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).
* **Description:** A specialized evolutionary mineral that serves as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **not for sale** via standard currency. It must be held by a Glalie to function, allowing it to transcend its standard form during combat.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; typically earned through gameplay milestones or Battle Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If held by a **Glalie**, the trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transforms the Pokémon into **Mega Glalie**, significantly increasing its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats, and granting it the **Refrigerate** ability (which converts Normal-type moves into Ice-type moves and boosts their power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: In competitive play, Mega Stones generally cannot be removed, stolen, or flung if the holder is the correct species).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Wallbreaker.** Mega Glalie is famous for "Refrigerate-boosted Explosion," one of the highest-damage single-turn attacks in the game. It is used primarily in formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Smogon's National Dex or Gen 6/7 retro-formats).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is exclusive to **Glalie**. It has no effect on its branching evolution, **Froslass**. Unlike standard evolution items (like an Ice Stone), the Glalitite is not consumed upon use and can be used indefinitely.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in icy or remote locations. In its debut (ORAS), it was discovered in the basement of **Shoal Cave** during low tide. In Generation VII (Alola), it is obtainable as a reward at the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a "Unique" item; under standard rules, a player can only obtain one per save file, and it cannot be held by a Pokémon traded through certain global systems to prevent loss of rare stones.
