## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cet188)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used in the Wild Area of the Galar region. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (denoted by the internal variable in the flavor text). It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal internal value; effectively **Not for Sale** as it is an event-exclusive distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area while carrying this crystal, it activates a Max Raid Battle. The specific Pokémon associated with code **cet188** will appear as a Dynamax (or Gigantamax) opponent. The effect persists until the end of the day it is activated or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) Max Raid Battles. Its primary value is providing access to rare Pokémon, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax forms that may be otherwise version-exclusive or difficult to find.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid at the designated lair.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts. It was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of specific retail promotions, pre-orders, or movie tie-ins (such as the CoroCoro or Dynamax Crystal distributions in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is an "Item Pocket" utility object rather than a "Held Item."
* **Lore context:** Dynamax Crystals are rare fragments tied to the Eternatus-driven Dynamax phenomenon. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which attract random Pokémon to any active den, a Dynamax Crystal acts as a beacon for a very specific, high-power entity at the ancient Watchtower Lair.
