## Identity & Utility
**HM01 (Cut)** is a **Hidden Machine** introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** A specialized machine used to teach the move **Cut** to compatible Pokémon. As a Hidden Machine (HM), it represents a permanent utility tool used for both navigation and combat. It is a **Key Utility** item that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently teaches the move **Cut** (a Normal-type Physical move) to a compatible Pokémon. In the overworld, this move allows the player to remove "thin trees" and tall grass that block progression.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (HMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Negligible.** With a low base power (50) and no secondary effects, Cut is almost never used in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon. It is primarily viewed as a "utility tax" for story progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Traditionally, moves taught via HM cannot be forgotten unless the player visits a **Move Deleter** NPC, preventing players from getting stranded behind environmental obstacles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift from a high-profile NPC after completing a specific story beat (e.g., received from the Captain of the S.S. Anne in Kanto, or from an NPC in Rustboro City in Hoenn). It is required to access specific gyms or late-game areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique, one-of-a-kind key item in most regional playthroughs.
* **Legacy Context:** While this specific data references the machine's presence through Generation VI and the Gen VIII remakes (BDSP), the HM system was largely retired in later generations in favor of "Poke Ride" or "Secret Techniques" to remove the need for "HM Slaves" (Pokémon dedicated solely to carrying utility moves).
