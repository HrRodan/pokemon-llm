## Identity & Utility
**Silver Nanab Berry** is a **Catching-Bonus Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized berry used during the capture phase to calm wild Pokémon, making them less erratic. It acts as a mid-tier upgrade to the standard Nanab Berry, significantly reducing the Pokémon's frequency of movement and attacks. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought or found.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Cost**; represents a premium over standard berries).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a wild Pokémon during an encounter, it drastically slows down the Pokémon’s movements and reduces its aggression (jumps, dodges, and attacks). This makes it significantly easier to aim and land Poké Ball throws, particularly for fast-moving or "jumpy" species.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; rarely used in battle as its primary utility is restricted to the capture screen).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Smogon, VGC, or standard trainer-vs-trainer battles. It is strictly a "Catching Utility" item for overworld encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the three-tier Nanab hierarchy: Nanab Berry (Basic) < **Silver Nanab Berry (Enhanced)** < Golden Nanab Berry (Maximum).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Let's Go versions) through hidden item spots (such as in **Cerulean Cave**), as rewards from **Coach Trainers**, or by transferring Pokémon from *Pokémon GO*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon in the core series games. It is primarily a player-distributed resource rather than a gathered organic material like berries in other regions (e.g., Sinnoh or Hoenn).
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of capture items, the "Silver" variants represent a professional-grade tool for trainers seeking to capture high-mobility Pokémon without the extreme rarity/expense of "Golden" variants.
