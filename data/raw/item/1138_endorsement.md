## Identity & Utility
**Endorsement** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** It is a formal letter of recommendation required for a Trainer to officially register for and participate in the Galar Gym Challenge. As a Key Item, it is categorized under "Plot Advancement," meaning it cannot be sold, discarded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Key Item; Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a "key" to progress the narrative. Possession of this item allows the player character to register at Motostoke Stadium, unlocking the ability to challenge Gym Leaders across the Galar region. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for single-player story progression and has no mechanical impact on Pokémon stats, moves, or competitive battle formats (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution, nor does it interact with abilities like Pickup, Klutz, or Sticky Hold.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained exclusively through story progression in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It is given to the player and their rival, Hop, by the Galar Champion, Leon, after they demonstrate their potential in a battle at Postwick.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind document tied to the player's identity as a Gym Challenger.
* **Context:** In the Galar region's lore, the Gym Challenge is a massive sporting event. Unlike other regions where anyone can challenge a Gym, Galar requires a formal sponsorship (Endorsement) from a recognized authority figure—such as the Champion, a Gym Leader, or a high-ranking official like Chairman Rose—to ensure only high-caliber trainers enter the circuit.
