## Identity & Utility
**Protective Pads** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that provides a physical barrier between the user and their target. It is a **Held Item** that can be purchased for a moderate price, designed specifically for physical attackers who rely on moves that make direct contact.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Protects the holder from the negative side effects of making direct contact with a target. This includes neutralizing damage from abilities like **Rough Skin**, **Iron Barbs**, and the **Rocky Helmet** item, as well as preventing status conditions or stat drops from abilities like **Static**, **Flame Body**, **Effect Spore**, **Gooey**, and **Tangling Hair**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **niche tactical choice** in Smogon and VGC formats. It is most effective on "Contact" specialists (like Urshifu-Rapid-Strike or Pheromosa) to prevent them from being worn down by defensive walls holding a Rocky Helmet or possessing punishing contact abilities (e.g., Garchomp or Ferrothorn).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It effectively grants the holder a mechanic similar to the **Long Reach** ability, allowing contact moves to be used safely.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available in late-game locations or specialized shops. In its debut generation (Sun/Moon), it was obtainable at the **Battle Tree** for BP. In later titles, it is often found in high-end shops like the **Wyndon Stadium** Mart or via the **Cram-o-matic**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or basic held items, Protective Pads are considered manufactured equipment and must be purchased or found in specific overworld locations.
* **Strategic Context:** While often passed over for damage-boosting items like Life Orb or Choice Band, Protective Pads are the premier counter-meta choice when the competitive environment is dominated by "chip-damage" defensive cores.
