## Identity & Utility
**Flying Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized fragment containing elemental energy. It is a consumable crafting and modification item used to alter the fundamental Terastal energy of a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Mid-range value; typically sold rather than bought, though they represent a significant time investment).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Flying Tera Shards are presented to the chef at the Treasure Eatery in Medali, the player can change a Pokémon's Tera Type to **Flying**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Impact.** Tera Shards are essential for competitive teambuilding in Gen 9 (VGC/Smogon). Changing a Pokémon to a Flying Tera Type is a popular tactical choice to grant immunity to Ground-type moves (like Earthquake) or to provide STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for powerful Flying-type moves like Acrobatics or Tera Blast.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It specifically interacts with the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for completing **Flying-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star raids and higher). They can also be found as sparkling dropped items in the overworld throughout the Paldea region, the Land of Kitakami, and the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. They are most efficiently gathered via high-level Raid farming or as rewards for Academy classes and gym rematches.
