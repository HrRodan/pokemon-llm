## Identity & Utility
**Black Sludge** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized recovery item that serves as the Poison-type counterpart to Leftovers. It provides passive healing to Poison-type Pokémon while actively punishing any other type that attempts to use it. It is a **Holdable Active** item that can be bought or found in the field.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a **Poison-type** Pokémon, it restores **1/16 (6.25%)** of the holder's maximum HP at the end of every turn. If held by a Pokémon of any other type, it instead inflicts damage equal to **1/8 (12.5%)** of the holder's maximum HP each turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for defensive Poison-types. It is strategically superior to Leftovers on Poison-types (such as **Toxapex**, **Amoonguss**, or **Galarian Weezing**) because it punishes opponents who use **Trick** or **Switcheroo** to steal the holder's item, turning a utility move into a source of chip damage for the opponent.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its damage effect is bypassed by the ability **Magic Guard**, but users with **Klutz** will neither receive healing nor take damage from it.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Often found in late-game areas near toxic environments, sewers, or via Battle Point (BP) vendors in post-game facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Historically found on wild Pokémon associated with pollution and sludge, specifically **Grimer**, **Muk** (including Alolan forms), **Trubbish**, **Garbodor**, **Croagunk**, and **Toxicroak**. These are the primary sources for farming the item via the **Thief** move or the **Pickup** ability.
