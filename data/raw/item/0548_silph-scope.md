## Identity & Utility
**Silph-scope** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (re-indexed in Generation III).
* **Description:** A high-tech optical device manufactured by Silph Co. that allows the user to see entities that are normally invisible to the naked eye. It is a **Key Item** specifically designed for overworld progression; it cannot be bought, sold, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Identifies the true forms of the "Ghost" spirits inhabiting the Pokémon Tower in Lavender Town. Without this item, these spirits appear as unidentifiable ghosts that cannot be battled or caught, and they will frighten the player's Pokémon, preventing movement past them. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-essential utility item used exclusively for campaign progression in the Kanto region games (Red/Blue/Yellow, FireRed/LeafGreen, and Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for initiating the battle against the ghost of **Marowak**. Defeating this ghost is required to rescue Mr. Fuji and obtain the Poké Flute. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained by defeating the Team Rocket Boss, **Giovanni**, in the Rocket Hideout located beneath the Celadon City Game Corner. In the *Let's Go* series, it is retrieved after the encounter with the secret base in the same location.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of Silph Co. technology and a one-of-a-kind item within the player's inventory.
* **Lore context:** The Silph Scope represents the technical prowess of the Silph Co. corporation, proving that their technology can bridge the gap between the physical and the supernatural. In the narrative, Team Rocket's possession of the device highlights their occupation of Kanto's major infrastructure.
