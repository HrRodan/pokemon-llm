## Identity & Utility
**Festival Ticket** is a **Gameplay Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specific consumable used within the **Festival Plaza** social hub in *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*. It serves as an entry token to initiate global or local missions. It is a **Consumable Gameplay Item** that is functionally limited to the Gen VII multiplayer suite.
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal cost in the game data, it is primarily obtained through NPC interactions rather than standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used within the Festival Plaza, the ticket allows the player to **host a Mission**. Missions are timed mini-games (such as "Type Chart Quiz" or "Find Pokémon") where players earn **Festival Coins (FC)** based on performance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is a field/plaza utility item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon). Its utility is strictly for social progression and farming Festival Coins to upgrade Plaza facilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Festival Plaza** mechanic. Using a ticket allows other players in the vicinity (or online) to join the host's mission to cooperate toward a shared goal.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, players are granted **three Festival Tickets per day** by talking to a woman standing in front of the castle within the Festival Plaza. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a service-based item provided by the Alolan Festival Plaza staff.
* **Context:** In the Alola region's lore, the Festival Plaza is a gathering place for Trainers from around the world. The Festival Ticket acts as the formal authorization to organize a group activity, encouraging community interaction and the growth of the Plaza's economy.
