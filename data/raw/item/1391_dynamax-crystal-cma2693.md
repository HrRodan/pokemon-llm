## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CMA2693)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A rare, event-specific consumable item used to trigger a specialized Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—historically associated with promotional distributions like **Gigantamax Sandaconda**—to appear for the remainder of the day. It is a single-use consumable that is not sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the data lists a price, this item is functionally "Priceless" as it is typically acquired through serial codes and cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to activate a red beam of light. This forces a Max Raid Battle with a pre-determined Pokémon that persists until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate the capture of rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon. It cannot be held by a Pokémon in a competitive match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. 

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** during special promotional events (such as retail collaborations or CoroCoro magazine distributions). It is not available through natural progression or in-game shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended for event-based player engagement, often used to give players access to Gigantamax forms earlier in the game than normally possible.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces which pull random Pokémon from the Max Raid pool, these specific "CMA" coded crystals are "tuned" to a specific Pokémon's signal, ensuring a guaranteed encounter with a rare species.
