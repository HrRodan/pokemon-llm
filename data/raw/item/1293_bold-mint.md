## Identity & Utility
**Bold Mint** is a **Nature-mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized aromatic herb used to modify a Pokémon's physiological development. When consumed, it shifts the Pokémon's stat growth to prioritize physical resilience at the expense of physical power. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought at specialized endgame shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible** in raw data, though typically valued at 50 BP or 50,000 Poké Dollars in regional markets).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently changes the Pokémon's stat growth patterns to match the **Bold Nature**. This results in a **10% increase to the Defense stat** and a **10% decrease to the Attack stat**. 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon’s actual Nature name (e.g., "Adamant") remains the same in the summary screen, but the stat highlights (Blue/Red) will shift to reflect the Bold Mint's influence.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility/Competitive Staple.** This item is essential for "fixing" the stats of Legendary, Mythical, or Shiny Pokémon that cannot be easily bred. The Bold Mint is specifically used for **Physically Defensive** builds, typically for Support Pokémon or Special Attackers who do not utilize their physical Attack stat and want to minimize damage taken from "Confusion" or the move "Foul Play."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Unlike traditional Natures, using a Mint does not change a Pokémon’s flavor preferences for Berries (which remains tied to the original Nature).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized locations such as the **Battle Tower** (Galar), **Chansey Supply** shops (Paldea), or as high-tier rewards in Tera Raid Battles and the Battle Frontier.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured or rare cultivated item intended for professional trainers. Unlike many herbs, it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
