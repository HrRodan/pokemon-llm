## Identity & Utility
**Wishing-star** is a **Plot-Advancement** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, glowing stone native to the Galar region. Folklore suggests that finding one allows the finder's dreams to come true, but its primary function is serving as a narrative catalyst for the region's unique battle mechanics. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While the item itself has no direct "use" from the bag in battle, it is the essential material required to craft a **Dynamax Band**. Once integrated into the band, it allows a Trainer to trigger the **Dynamax** (or Gigantamax) transformation in their Pokémon when positioned over a Power Spot (such as a Gym Stadium or a Max Raid Den).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None as a held item. However, it is the lore-justification for the **Dynamax mechanic**, which was the defining competitive feature of the Generation VIII VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Dynamax Band** and the **Power Spots** found throughout Galar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively through story progression in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It is typically granted to the player early in the game (often by Professor Magnolia) after a Wishing Star falls from the sky near the player and their rival.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** Wishing Stars are fragments of the legendary Pokémon **Eternatus**. When Eternatus was defeated thousands of years ago during the "Darkest Day," its power was scattered across Galar in the form of these stars. This "Galar Particle" energy is what allows Pokémon to grow to giant proportions and utilize Max Moves.
