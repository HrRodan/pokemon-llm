## Identity & Utility
**Gentle Mint** is a **Nature-Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized aromatic herb that modifies a Pokémon's stat growth patterns. When used, it adjusts the Pokémon's stats to match the **Gentle** nature. It is a **Consumable** item that is used directly from the bag.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Note: While the internal value is 20, it is traditionally **Expensive/Specialized**, typically costing 50 BP in Battle Towers or 20,000 Poké Dollars in Paldean Chansey Supply shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently changes the Pokémon's stat growth multipliers. Specifically, it increases the growth rate of **Special Defense** (+10%) and decreases the growth rate of **Defense** (-10%). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** Mints are essential for competitive play as they allow trainers to "fix" the stats of Legendary Pokémon, Shiny Pokémon, or gifted Pokémon without needing to breed for a specific nature. However, the "Gentle" nature itself is considered **Niche/Sub-optimal** in most competitive sets, as Defense is generally prioritized over Special Defense for balanced builds.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is important to note that the item changes the **stat multipliers** but does not change the Pokémon's actual "Nature" name (e.g., a Pokémon that was originally "Adamant" will still say "Adamant" in its profile, but its stats will reflect the "Gentle" Mint).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through end-game content. In Galar, it is purchased at the **Battle Tower** for Battle Points (BP). In Paldea, it is widely available at **Chansey Supply** outlets after earning enough Gym Badges. It can also be found as a rare sparkling pickup in the **Wild Area** or as a reward for high-tier **Tera Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a human-cultivated or rare wild herb used specifically for professional Pokémon training.
