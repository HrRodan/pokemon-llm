## Identity & Utility
**TR53 (Close Combat)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Close Combat**, a high-risk, high-reward Fighting-type physical attack. Unlike TMs in its debut generation, this is a **single-use** consumable that breaks after teaching the move. 
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value**). In its native Galar region, it is often traded for Watts rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Close Combat** (Power: 120, Accuracy: 100%). The move causes the user to fight at point-blank range, dealing massive damage but lowering the user's **Defense** and **Special Defense** stats by one stage each upon successful execution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120. This is one of the highest Fling powers in the game, making it a viable emergency high-damage projectile if the user possesses the move **Fling**.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Close Combat is arguably the best Fighting-type physical move in the game. It is a cornerstone of offensive sets for Fighting types (like Lucario and Zacian) and physical attackers needing coverage (like Arcanine or Staraptor). It is used extensively in both VGC and Smogon formats to break through Steel, Rock, and Ice-type walls.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR53 is primarily obtained via **Max Raid Battles** involving Fighting-type Pokémon or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a varying amount of Watts (typically 5,000 – 8,000 W).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** held by wild Pokémon. It must be earned through raid victories or specialized currency exchange, reflecting its status as a powerful combat technique.
* **World Knowledge:** TRs represent a return to the original mechanic of TMs being "disposable," requiring trainers to strategically decide which Pokémon deserves such a powerful offensive upgrade. TR53 is often considered one of the most sought-after TRs due to the universal utility of Close Combat.
