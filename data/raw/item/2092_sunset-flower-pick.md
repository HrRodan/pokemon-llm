## Identity & Utility
**Sunset Flower Pick** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used during the sandwich-making process at a Pokémon Picnic. It functions as a cosmetic stabilizer to secure sandwich ingredients. It is a **Consumable** item specifically designed for the picnic mini-game.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When crafting a sandwich during a picnic, the Sunset Flower Pick is used as the final step to "finish" the sandwich. While it primarily serves a cosmetic purpose, using a pick is required to complete the sandwich-making process and trigger the resulting **Meal Powers** (such as Egg Power, Catching Power, or Sparkling Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. Its value is strictly limited to the overworld picnic mechanic and the management of Meal Power buffs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Sandwich-making mechanic** in the Paldea region. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at specialized retail outlets in the Paldea region, specifically **Artisan Bakery** and **Picnic Knick-Knacks** stores found in major towns like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, this is a commercially manufactured goods item intended for trainer recreation.
