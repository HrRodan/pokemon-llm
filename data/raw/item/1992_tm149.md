## Identity & Utility
**TM149 (Earthquake)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the move **Earthquake** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In Gen IX, it is acquired via exploration or crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Earthquake**, a powerful Ground-type physical attack. 
    * **Move Stats:** Power: 100 | Accuracy: 100% | PP: 10. 
    * **Secondary Mechanics:** Deals double damage to targets using the move *Dig*. In Double Battles, it targets all adjacent Pokémon (including allies).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **God-Tier Competitive Staple.** Earthquake is arguably the most consistent and influential physical move in the history of competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). Its high base power and perfect accuracy make it the gold standard for Ground-type coverage, though users must play around the "spread damage" reduction and the prevalence of the *Levitate* ability or Flying-types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a fundamental tool for expanding the movepools of Physical Attackers, particularly those with the *STAB* (Same Type Attack Bonus) advantage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Paldea:** Obtained as a reward from the Pokémon League Representative at the **Asado Desert** (Cascarrafa North rest stop) after defeating five Trainers in the area.
    * **Crafting:** Once unlocked, it can be crafted at any TM Machine using:
        * 12,000 LP
        * 5× Phanpy Nails
        * 3× Diglett Dirt
        * 3× Barboach Slime
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a man-made utility item for trainers.
