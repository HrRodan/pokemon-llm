## Identity & Utility
**Dire Hit 2** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An enhanced version of the standard Dire Hit, this item is specifically designed for use within the **Wonder Launcher** battle format. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that cannot be purchased with standard currency, as it operates on a points-based system during multiplayer matches.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired by accumulating points during a Wonder Launcher-enabled battle.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon during battle, it **raises the target’s critical-hit ratio by two stages**. This is significantly more powerful than the standard Dire Hit (which only raises it by one stage). In the context of Generation V mechanics, two stages increase the critical hit probability to 50%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a specialized UI menu and is not a held item; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Format-Locked.** It is ineligible for standard VGC or Smogon competitive play as it requires the "Wonder Launcher" setting to be enabled. Within that specific Gen V gimmick format, it is a high-value offensive buff used to bypass an opponent's defensive boosts (since critical hits ignore positive defensive stat changes).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. The effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out of battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in **Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2** during multiplayer battles where the Wonder Launcher setting is toggled "On." Players must wait for their launcher gauge to fill to the required point threshold to activate the item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon** and cannot be gathered via the Pickup ability, as it is a digital manifestation of the Wonder Launcher system rather than a physical item stored in the player's standard bag.
