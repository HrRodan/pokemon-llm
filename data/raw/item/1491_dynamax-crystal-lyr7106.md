## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★And458 (lyr7106)** is a **Special Event Item** (specifically a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable crystal used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It functions as a beacon to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. Based on the "lyr7106" coding, this specific crystal is associated with the **Lycanroc (Midnight Form)** encounter. It is a **Consumable** item that is used from the bag at a specific location; it cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap nominal value; however, it is not available for standard purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it instantly triggers a **Max Raid Battle** featuring a specific Pokémon—in this case, Midnight Form Lycanroc. The raid remains active until the end of the day it was activated or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. The item itself has no competitive battle application as a held item. Its utility lies in providing access to a Pokémon that may have **Hidden Abilities (No Guard)** or **High Individual Values (IVs)** for competitive breeding and training.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **limited-distribution event item**. Dynamax Crystals were typically distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop or EB Games) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass or Dual Pack.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a strictly event-managed item.
* **Context:** Unlike Wishing Pieces, which trigger random raids in active dens, Dynamax Crystals are "guaranteed" encounters. They allow players to face specific, often rare, Pokémon regardless of the current weather or standard den rotation. The "★And" prefix in the internal naming convention typically denotes "Android" or specific promotional tie-ins used during the Generation VIII lifecycle.
