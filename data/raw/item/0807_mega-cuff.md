## Identity & Utility
**Mega-Cuff** is an **Unused / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is an internal variant of the Mega Ring/Mega Bracelet. According to its flavor text, it is a bracelet containing "untold power" that allows Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone to undergo Mega Evolution. While it appears visually as the Mega Bracelet worn by the male player character during specific animations (such as in Pokémon Contests or battle transitions), it is functionally a dummy item within the game's code. It **cannot** be bought or obtained through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Theoretically enables **Mega Evolution**. When a Trainer possesses a Key Stone (like this Cuff) and a Pokémon holds a corresponding Mega Stone, the Pokémon can Mega Evolve once per battle, significantly boosting its stats and potentially changing its Ability and Type. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As an unobtainable "unused" item, it has no presence in the VGC or Smogon competitive circuits. The actual Mega Evolution mechanic in Generation VII is triggered by the *Z-Ring* or *Electrium Z* modified for Mega Evolution in the post-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is intended to interact with all Pokémon capable of **Mega Evolution** (e.g., Charizard, Mewtwo, Lucario), provided they are holding their specific Mega Stone.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** In the Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon game files, this item exists as a placeholder or specific visual asset for the male player's Mega Evolution accessory. It is never placed in the player's inventory through legitimate means.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The Mega-Cuff represents the Alolan interpretation of the Mega Ring first seen in Kalos. In the Alola region, Mega Evolution is a secondary mechanic discovered in the post-game, as the region's primary focus is Z-Moves. The "unused" status of the Mega-Cuff suggests it may have been a leftover asset from the development of Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire or a discarded alternative to the Z-Ring's dual functionality.
