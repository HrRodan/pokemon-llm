## Identity & Utility
**Dropped-Item--Red** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in Gen VII data) introduced in **Generation V** (Pokémon Black 2 & White 2).
* **Description:** This item is an **Xtransceiver** lost by its owner at the Nimbasa City amusement park. Despite its classification in Generation VII data, it is a narrative-driven quest item intended for a specific side-story. It belongs to a character named **Curtis**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its original context (*Black 2 & White 2*), picking up this item initiates a lengthy side-quest. The player receives calls from the owner (Curtis) at specific locations across Unova. After a series of 10 calls, the player meets Curtis to return the item, eventually leading to the ability to trade for rare Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld progression and social side-quests within the Alola/Unova legacy data. It provides no statistical advantage in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. Its primary "interaction" is triggering the friendship-based trading sequence with the NPC Curtis.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found on the ground in the **Nimbasa City Amusement Park** (near the Ferris Wheel). It is only available if the player character is female; if the player is male, the "Dropped Item" found is Blue (belonging to Yancy).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time world object.
* **World Knowledge Context:** Although the provided JSON lists this under Generation VII (Alola), the item is historically a **Generation V legacy asset**. Its presence in later game files often serves as "placeholder" or "internal data" for the Xtransceiver mechanics, explaining the "unused" category label. In the original Unova games, it is the gateway to obtaining non-regional Pokémon like Spiritomb, Snorlax, and Togepi with their Hidden Abilities.
