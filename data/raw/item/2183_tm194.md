## Identity & Utility
**TM194 (Grassy Glide)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches the move **Grassy Glide** to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are consumable, single-use items that must be crafted or found. It is a **Specialized Move Tutor** item that provides a significant tactical advantage for Grass-type attackers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted at the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Grassy Glide**. 
    * **Move Type:** Grass / Physical.
    * **Move Power:** 55 (reduced from 70 in Gen 8).
    * **The Priority Mechanic:** If the battlefield is under the effect of **Grassy Terrain**, this move gains **+1 Priority**, allowing the user to strike before the opponent regardless of Speed tiers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** This move is the cornerstone of "Rillaboom" strategies in both VGC and Smogon formats. Despite the power nerf in Gen 9, the ability to bypass speed tiers with a terrain-boosted priority move makes it essential for revenge killing and late-game sweeping.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the Ability **Grassy Surge** (held by Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu) and the move **Grassy Terrain**. It is a "contact" move, meaning it is affected by items like Rocky Helmet or the Ability Rough Skin.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy (*The Indigo Disk*). It can be found as a collectible item in the wild (Coastal Biome) or unlocked for crafting.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM194, the player requires:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Volbeat Fluid**
    * **3x Foongus Spores**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; must be obtained through the TM Machine system or specific overworld spawns.
