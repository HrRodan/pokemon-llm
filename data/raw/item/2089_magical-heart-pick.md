## Identity & Utility
**Magical Heart Pick** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used during the sandwich-making process at a Pokémon Picnic. It serves as the final structural component to secure a sandwich's ingredients. It is a **Consumable** item that **Can** be bought in bulk. 
* **Cost:** 600 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When crafting a sandwich during a Picnic, the player must place a pick to complete the meal. The Magical Heart Pick provides a specific aesthetic (a heart-shaped design) to the finished sandwich. While the pick itself is cosmetic and does not change the "Meal Power" stats of the sandwich, it is a required tool for the crafting process.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and is stored in the Picnic Item pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the **Picnic Mechanic**. However, the sandwiches it helps create are vital for high-level play preparation, providing "Meal Powers" such as **Egg Power** (for breeding), **Sparkling Power** (for Shiny hunting), and **Humungo/Teensy Power** (for size variation).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. It is purely a crafting component for the Gen IX culinary system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Regularly stocked at specialized culinary and picnic retailers throughout the Paldea region, most notably at **Every Wich Way** and **Picnic Knacks** stores in major hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured commercial good intended for trainers. Unlike berries or certain hold items, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
