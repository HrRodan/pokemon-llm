## Identity & Utility
**TR73 (Gunk Shot)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Gunk Shot**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use. It is a high-tier offensive machine that is generally considered a premium resource.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/High-value). In its debut region, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Gunk Shot** to a compatible Pokémon. Gunk Shot is a powerful **Poison-type physical move** with a base power of 120 and an 80% accuracy rate. It carries a 30% chance to induce the Poison status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120. This is one of the highest Fling values in the game, making it a viable (though costly) emergency high-damage projectile.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact Offensive Tool.** Gunk Shot is the strongest physical Poison-type move in the game. It is a staple coverage move for physical attackers (such as Cinderace, Muk, or Toxicroak) to specifically target and OHKO or 2HKO bulky Fairy-types like Clefable or Tapu Fini. Its low accuracy makes it a "high-risk, high-reward" choice.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed after one use, necessitating multiple copies for teams requiring multiple Poison-type physical attackers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR73 is predominantly acquired from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a varying price in Watts. It can also be obtained as a reward for completing high-level **Max Raid Battles** against Poison-type Pokémon (e.g., Garbodor or Toxtricity).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily distributed through Galar's unique Max Raid ecosystem and the Pickup ability does not yield TRs in Generation VIII.
