## Identity & Utility
**TM139 (Mist)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk* expansion).
* **Description:** It is a teaching tool used to permanently grant a compatible Pokémon the move **Mist**. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly at any TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy economy, it is acquired through exploration or crafting rather than direct purchase with currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Mist**. When used in battle, Mist creates a protective white shroud around the user’s team for five turns. This shroud prevents the user's (and allies') stats from being lowered by the opponent's moves or abilities (e.g., Intimidate, Growl, or Fake Tears). It does not prevent self-inflicted stat drops (e.g., from Draco Meteor).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** In the VGC (Doubles) format, Mist is a tech choice to counter "Intimidate" cycling or "Snarl" spam. However, it is largely outclassed by the **Clear Amulet** held item or Pokémon with the **Clear Body** ability, which provide similar protection without requiring a turn of setup. In Smogon Singles, it is rarely seen as it takes up a valuable move slot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide range of Ice-type Pokémon and certain Water or Flying types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM139 is primarily found in the **Terarium** of the Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk DLC). It can be found as a collectible item ball in the **Polar Biome**. Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked at the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM139, trainers typically require:
    * **800 LP** (League Points)
    * **Surskit Syrup** (x3)
    * **Swablu Fluff** (x3)
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured technological device. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
