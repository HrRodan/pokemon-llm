## Identity & Utility
**Swampertite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in Generation VI (specifically *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*), though it is indexed here within the Generation VII (Alola) catalog.
* **Description:** A mysterious, radiating gemstone designed specifically for the Swampert evolutionary line. When held by a Swampert, it acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution, allowing the Pokémon to transcend its normal limitations during combat. It is a **Held Item** that is **not consumable**; it remains with the Pokémon after use.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Like most Mega Stones, it is treated as a unique or high-value treasure rather than a commercial commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If held by a Swampert, the Trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn, transforming Swampert into **Mega Swampert**. This transformation significantly increases its Attack, Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense, and grants it the **Swift Swim** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. While it has a respectable Fling power, using Fling will discard the stone and prevent Mega Evolution for the remainder of the battle, making this a counter-intuitive strategy.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Swampertite is the cornerstone of "Rain Offense" archetypes in Smogon and VGC formats where Mega Evolution is permitted. Because Mega Swampert gains *Swift Swim*, it becomes a premier physical sweeper when paired with Drizzle users like Pelipper or Politoed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is species-specific. It has no effect on Mudkip or Marshtomp. It cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by the correct species (Swampert), providing a level of utility as a "sticky" item that cannot be easily lost during a match.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Swampertite is never found in standard Poké Marts. In its debut (ORAS), it is gifted by Steven Stone or purchased from the Route 114 Stone Salesman. In Generation VII (Sun/Moon), it was initially a high-tier reward for Battle Tree participation or limited-time Mystery Gift distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. This is a singular, legendary-tier artifact typically tied to a Trainer's "Mega Ring" or "Mega Bracelet."
* **Lore context:** As a Mega Stone, it represents the biological bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon, reacting to the "Key Stone" to release the Pokémon's hidden energy.
