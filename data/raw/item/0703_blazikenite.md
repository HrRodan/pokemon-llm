## Identity & Utility
**Blazikenite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos Region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized held item that enables a specific Pokémon to transcend its final evolution. When held by Blaziken, it allows for Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Permanent Held Item** that cannot be purchased from standard vendors.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by Blaziken, the trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transforms Blaziken into **Mega Blaziken**, significantly increasing its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats, and granting it the **Speed Boost** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but flinging the item removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the encounter).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Top-Tier Threat.** Mega Blaziken is historically one of the most powerful offensive forces in the franchise. Due to its "Speed Boost" ability and high offensive stats, it was frequently banned from standard competitive play (Smogon OU) and moved to the **Ubers** tier. 
    * **Item Protection:** Unlike most held items, a Mega Stone cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, nor can it be consumed by *Pluck* or *Bug Bite*, provided it is being held by the correct Pokémon (Blaziken).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This does not trigger a permanent evolution but a temporary, battle-only transformation. It bypasses the effects of the ability *Klutz* (which usually prevents item use) only for the purpose of Mega Evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Blazikenite is never found in Marts. It is typically a **Special Gift** or **Event Item**. In *Pokémon X/Y*, it was distributed via a limited-time Wi-Fi event featuring a Torchic. In *Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire*, it is given to the player by Steven Stone or purchased at the Route 114 Stone Salesman.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure, often tied to the lore of the Hoenn starters or the origins of Mega Evolution in Kalos.
