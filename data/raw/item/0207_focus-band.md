## Identity & Utility
**Focus Band** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** An accessory to be held by a Pokémon that provides a slim chance of survival when facing a knockout blow. Unlike the Focus Sash, the Focus Band is **not consumed upon use** and does not require the holder to be at full HP to activate. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be purchased.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Price**; often found in specialized shops or Battle Frontiers).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by an attack (including self-inflicted confusion damage) that would otherwise cause it to faint, there is a **10% chance** the holder will endure the hit with **1 HP** remaining.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Unreliable.** In serious competitive play (Smogon/VGC), the Focus Band is almost entirely outclassed by the **Focus Sash**, which guarantees survival at 1 HP from full health. The Focus Band is primarily used in "luck-based" strategies or in specific in-game Battle Facilities where NPCs may use it to create "hax" (unpredictable luck) moments.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. Its effect is independent of the **Sturdy** ability, though they can both exist on the same Pokémon for multiple layers of survival (albeit with diminishing returns).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available for purchase at Battle Frontiers, Battle Subways, or high-end department stores (like the Veilstone Department Store in Sinnoh). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously associated with the **Machop line**. It can be found with a 5% rarity on wild **Machop**, **Machoke**, and **Machamp**. Skilled trainers often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and moves like **Thief** or **Covet** to farm these from wild encounters in rocky or mountainous areas.
