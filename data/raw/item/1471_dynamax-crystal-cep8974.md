## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CEP8974** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle encounter at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the encounter remains active until the end of the day. It functions as a "summoning" item for rare or event-specific Dynamax Pokémon. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; while technically "cheap," it is a rare promotional item and not typically available in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—**Jigglypuff**—to appear in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item used for out-of-battle encounters. However, it is valuable for competitive players looking to catch a Jigglypuff with specific IVs, Abilities (such as the Hidden Ability *Friend Guard* for its evolution Wigglytuff), or for Shiny hunting in a controlled raid environment.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via unique serial codes as part of specific retail promotions (such as those through GameStop or EB Games) or via the Pokémon Trainer Club newsletter. It is not found through normal gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items that can be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this crystal is a "Key-style" consumable obtained only through external distributions.
* **Location Context:** The Watchtower Lair is the only location where this item can be activated. If a player has multiple different Dynamax Crystals, they can only activate one per day at this specific den.
