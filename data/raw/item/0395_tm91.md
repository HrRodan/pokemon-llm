## Identity & Utility
**TM91 (Flash Cannon)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. It teaches **Flash Cannon**, a Special Steel-type move where the user gathers light energy and releases it at the target. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that is generally considered a premium instructional tool.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flash Cannon** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Attributes:** Flash Cannon is a Special move with a Base Power of 80 and 100% Accuracy. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Competitive Staple).** Flash Cannon is the gold standard for Special Steel-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). It is essential for Special-heavy Steel types like **Magnezone**, **Aegislash**, **Lucario**, and **Gholdengo** to counter Fairy, Ice, and Rock types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Teaching this move is often a prerequisite for maximizing the offensive coverage of Special-attacking Pokémon. It interacts with abilities like **Mega Launcher** (though not boosted by it, it fits the "cannon" theme) and is frequently used by Pokémon with the **Steelworker** or **Steely Spirit** abilities to amplify damage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM91 is typically found in mid-to-late game locations or high-end Department Stores. In its debut (Sinnoh), it was obtained from Byron after defeating the Canalave City Gym or found in **Iron Island**. In modern iterations (Scarlet/Violet), it can be crafted at the TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is usually a fixed-location pickup, a Gym Leader reward, or a high-cost purchase, reflecting its status as a high-tier offensive move.
