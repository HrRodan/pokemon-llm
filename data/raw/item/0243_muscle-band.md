## Identity & Utility
**Muscle Band** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A headband infused with martial energy that slightly augments the wearer's physical prowess. It is a persistent **Held Item** that remains active throughout battle and is not consumed upon use. 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard**). In most regions, this item is typically acquired via Battle Points (BP) in post-game facilities rather than standard currency, though its internal value reflects a mid-tier competitive tool.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon's **Physical moves** (moves that use the Attack stat) deal **10% more damage**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is considered a **Niche/Entry-level offensive item**. While it provides a consistent boost with no drawbacks (unlike the recoil of a *Life Orb* or the move-locking of a *Choice Band*), the 10% modifier is relatively low. It is primarily used on physical attackers that require high flexibility and cannot afford to lose HP, or in certain "In-Game" playthroughs where more powerful items are not yet available.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is the physical counterpart to the **Wise Glasses** (which provides a 10% boost to Special moves). It does not trigger any specific evolutions or unique ability interactions beyond standard damage calculation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available through Battle Frontier/Battle Subway shops or found in late-game locations (such as the Battle Zone in Sinnoh or the Battle Resort in Hoenn). It is rarely found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found on wild Pokémon**. It must be obtained through exploration, specialized vendors, or high-tier trainers. Unlike many other bands or scarves, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability, making it a more "professional" tier of equipment for seasoned trainers.
