## Identity & Utility
**Heal Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A remedial Poké Ball designed for immediate utility. It is a **consumable battle item** that can be bought at most early-to-mid-game Poké Marts. It is specifically designed to streamline the recruitment of new team members by removing the need for an immediate trip to a Pokémon Center.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It sits between a standard Poké Ball (200) and a Great Ball (600) in terms of pricing.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a wild encounter, it attempts to catch the target with a **1× Catch Rate** (identical to a standard Poké Ball). Upon a successful capture, the Pokémon’s **HP is fully restored**, **PP for all moves is replenished**, and any **status ailments** (poison, paralysis, etc.) are cured instantly.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be effectively used with the move Fling for damage or secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Competitive.** Its effects only trigger upon capture, making it useless in standard VGC or Smogon formats where catching is prohibited. 
    * **Nuzlocke/Playthrough Utility:** High. It is a "Quality of Life" item, especially useful for players on long routes or during Nuzlocke challenges where resources are scarce and a newly caught Pokémon might need to fight immediately.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. However, it is often selected by trainers for its aesthetic—a distinct pink and white color scheme—to match "cute" or "feminine" Pokémon (e.g., Sylveon, Chansey).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in Poké Marts across most regions starting from Sinnoh. It is often found in the early-game inventory of specialized shops or regional Pokémon Centers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. Unlike standard Poké Balls, it is rarely gathered via the **Pickup** ability, making direct purchase the primary method of acquisition.
* **Trainer Note:** If used in a Trainer battle, the ball is wasted and the turn is lost, as with all Poké Balls. Its 1× catch rate makes it inefficient for catching high-level Legendaries, where Ultra Balls or Timer Balls are preferred.
