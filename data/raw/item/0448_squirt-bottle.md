## Identity & Utility
**Squirt Bottle** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in Generation II (and featured prominently in the Generation IV Johto remakes).
* **Description:** A specialized watering can shaped like a Squirtle. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or consumed. It is used primarily as a progression tool to interact with the environment and manage berry growth.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Unique Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Squirt Bottle serves two main functional purposes:
    1. **Environmental Interaction:** It is required to spray water on the strange "wiggling tree" blocking **Route 36** in the Johto region. This triggers a static encounter with **Sudowoodo**, allowing the player to catch it and clear the path to Ecruteak City and Violet City.
    2. **Horticulture:** In *HeartGold and SoulSilver*, it is used to water Berries planted within the **Berry Pots** (portable soil containers). Regular watering prevents soil from drying out and maximizes the berry yield.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a purely utility-based item used for story progression and the "Overworld" gardening mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly triggers the encounter with Sudowoodo. It has no direct interaction with Pokémon abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it cannot be held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a gift from the **Goldenrod City Flower Shop**. In most iterations, the NPC will only provide the Squirt Bottle after the player has defeated the Goldenrod Gym Leader, **Whitney**, and earned the Plain Badge, effectively serving as a "Badge Gate" for world exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item provided by an NPC.
* **World Knowledge:** The Squirt Bottle is part of a lineage of watering items used across different regions, including the **Wailmer Pail** (Hoenn), the **Sprayduck** (Sinnoh), and the **Sprinklotad** (Kalos). While its primary fame comes from the Sudowoodo event, its utility in Berry cultivation makes it essential for players looking to farm competitive-grade berries for natural cures and damage-reduction.
