## Identity & Utility
**TM100 (Confide)** is an **All-Machines** item introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Machine (TM) allows a Pokémon to learn the move **Confide**. In the context of Generation VI and VII, TMs are infinite-use items. The move itself involves the user whispering a secret to the target, causing them to lose focus and reducing their offensive capabilities. 
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (Accessible; standard pricing for mid-tier Technical Machines).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Confide** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Details:** Confide is a Normal-type Status move that lowers the target's **Special Attack** stat by one stage. 
    * **Special Property:** Confide is a **sound-based move**, meaning it bypasses a target's Substitute, but it is completely nullified by Pokémon with the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in a meaningful way).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Low Utility.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), Confide is rarely seen. It is largely outclassed by **Snarl**, which lowers Special Attack while dealing chip damage, or **Eerie Impulse**, which lowers Special Attack by two stages. It is primarily used in casual playthroughs or Nuzlockes to neuter dangerous special-attacking bosses.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a vast majority of Pokémon, as almost all Pokémon capable of learning TMs can learn Confide.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Pokémon X & Y**, it is obtained from a tourist in the Coumarine City hotel.
    * In **Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, & Ultra Moon**, it is found in the Hau'oli City Shopping Mall.
    * As a TM, it represents the shift in later generations toward "social" or "psychological" status moves.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly through overworld discovery or specific NPC interactions within the Kalos and Alola regions.
