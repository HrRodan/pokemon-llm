## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2286** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable** item that is consumed upon use to spawn a specific Pokémon (based on the crystal variant) for a limited time (until the end of the day). 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a technical price in the code, it is not available for purchase through standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—typically one that might be rare or version-exclusive—to appear in a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the player wins the battle or the day ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive battles (VGC/Smogon). Its sole purpose is to facilitate a specific encounter in the overworld to catch a Pokémon that may possess a Hidden Ability or high IVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used to interact with the Max Raid Den mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **special promotions and serial codes**, most notably as a pre-order bonus for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield* Double Pack. Specifically, "Gem2286" is associated with the encounter for **Larvitar** (usually exclusive to *Shield*, but made available in *Sword* via this crystal) or **Jangmo-o** (usually exclusive to *Sword*, but made available in *Shield* via this crystal).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is an event-exclusive distribution item intended to help players complete their Pokédex with version-exclusive entries early in the game.
