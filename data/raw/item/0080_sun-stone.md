## Identity & Utility
**Sun Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in Generation II (notably featured in Generation IV's Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A peculiar, radiant stone that burns as red as the evening sun. It is a **Consumable** item used to trigger permanent biological changes in specific Pokémon species. While it has a defined price, it is often treated as a rare find rather than a common shop staple.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range** cost).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a compatible Pokémon, it consumes the stone to trigger an immediate evolution. 
* **Evolutionary Lineages:**
    * **Gloom** → **Bellossom**
    * **Sunkern** → **Sunflora**
    * **Cottonee** → **Whimsicott**
    * **Petilil** → **Lilligant** (including Hisuian Lilligant in relevant titles)
    * **Helioptile** → **Heliolisk**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item provides no benefit when held in battle. Its competitive value is purely **pre-battle**, as it is required to obtain **Whimsicott** (a top-tier Prankster support in VGC) and **Lilligant** (a potent Sun-team sweeper).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is a single-use item. Once the evolution is complete, the stone is destroyed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Sinnoh region, it is a frequent find in the **Underground** (mining minigame). In other regions, it is often found in desert environments, at the Pokéathlon Dome, or awarded via the Bug-Catching Contest.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is rarely held by wild **Solrock** (typically a 5% encounter rate). Efficient trainers use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to farm these stones from wild populations.
