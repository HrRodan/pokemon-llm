## Identity & Utility
**Dusk Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized capture device designed with a unique matte black and green shell. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that can be bought at most mid-to-late game Pokémon Marts. It is specifically engineered to function more effectively in low-light environments.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Tier**; priced identically to an Ultra Ball).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a cave or during the night (typically 8:00 PM to 3:59 AM in-game time), it grants a **3.5× Catch Rate multiplier**. If these conditions are not met, it functions as a standard Poké Ball with a **1× multiplier**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling in most generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no impact on stats or combat, the Dusk Ball is a **top-tier utility item for Nuzlockes and Legendary hunting**. It provides a significantly higher success rate than an Ultra Ball (2.0×) when its conditions are met. 
    * **Aesthetics:** In the competitive breeding community, it is highly sought after for its unique "dark puff" and green shadow entrance animation, often paired with **Ghost, Dark, or Shiny Pokémon** for thematic consistency.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is a "countable" item, meaning trainers can stack and manage quantities in their Bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at Pokémon Marts throughout the Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, and Paldea regions. It is often found early in areas near major cave systems (e.g., Oreburgh City).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; it is primarily a manufactured item for trainers.
* **Strategic Context:** The Dusk Ball is widely considered one of the most efficient Poké Balls in the franchise's history. Because a significant portion of "Boss" encounters and Legendaries (like Mewtwo, Giratina, or Heatran) reside in caves, the Dusk Ball is the "Gold Standard" for high-stakes captures, often outperforming the more expensive or rarer specialized balls.
