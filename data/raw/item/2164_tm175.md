## Identity & Utility
**TM175 (Toxic)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX** (*Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask*).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that grants a compatible Pokémon the move **Toxic**. In the Paldea and Kitakami regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be replicated using a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In Generation IX, it is acquired via exploration or crafted using 5,000 League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Toxic**. This move inflicts the **Badly Poisoned** status condition on the target, which causes increasing damage at the end of every turn (1/16th of max HP, then 2/16ths, and so on).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be effectively used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Toxic is a fundamental tool for "Stall" and "Bulky Offense" teams. It is used to pressure defensive walls and put a timer on the opponent's longevity. In Gen IX, its distribution was limited, making Pokémon that can learn TM175 highly valuable.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Poison-type Synergy:** When used by a Poison-type Pokémon, the move Toxic has 100% accuracy and can bypass the semi-invulnerable state of moves like Fly, Dig, or Dive.
    * **Corrosion Ability:** If taught to a Pokémon with the **Corrosion** ability (like Salazzle or Glimmora), it can be used to badly poison Steel and Poison-type Pokémon, which are normally immune.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically introduced as part of the **The Teal Mask** DLC (Kitakami region). It can be found as a physical item on the ground in the **Timeless Woods** or obtained by defeating a specific number of trainers in the region.
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once the recipe is unlocked, it requires the following materials at a TM Machine:
    * **5,000 LP**
    * **3x Wooper Mucus**
    * **3x Gastly Gas**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured device.
