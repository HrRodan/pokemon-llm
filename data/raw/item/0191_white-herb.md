## Identity & Utility
**White Herb** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An herbal medicine designed to be held by a Pokémon during battle. It acts as a corrective measure against stat reduction, automatically purging negative modifiers. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is used up immediately upon activation (though it is typically restored after the match in competitive/link battles).
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Premium**). While it has a high monetary value, it is frequently obtained through secondary currencies like Battle Points (BP) in various Battle Facilities.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder’s stats are lowered (via opponent moves like *Leer* or *Growl*, abilities like *Intimidate*, or self-inflicted drops from moves like *Close Combat* or *Draco Meteor*), the White Herb is consumed at the end of the turn to reset all lowered stats to their neutral (0) stages.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. Using **Fling** with this item will trigger the "herb-effect" on the target, resetting any of the target's lowered stats.
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple**. It is most famously used by "Shell Smash" users (e.g., Cloyster, Polteageist, Minior) to negate the Defense and Special Defense drops provided by the boost, or by powerful attackers using high-recoil moves like *Overheat* or *Leaf Storm* to maintain their offensive pressure. It also serves as a hard counter to the *Intimidate* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is ignored by Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability and cannot be used if the Pokémon is under the effect of **Embargo** or **Magic Room**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Rarely sold in standard Poké Marts; it is usually found in specialized shops such as the **Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, or Battle Tree**. In some regions, it can be purchased at high-end department stores or herb shops (like the one in Driftveil City).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. Players must rely on finding it as overworld loot or purchasing it through Battle Point exchanges. Unlike Berries, it cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or natural growth in most generations.
