## Identity & Utility
**TM31** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in its modern form in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide a Pokémon with a specific move it may not learn naturally. In all iterations from Generation III onwards, TM31 teaches the move **Brick Break**. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game generation's mechanics) that is generally available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Brick Break** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Brick Break Details:** A Physical Fighting-type move with 75 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. Its signature utility is the ability to **destroy defensive barriers** (Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil) on the target's side of the field upon impact.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be Flung in most generations, or have no secondary effect if they can).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** Brick Break is a frequent choice for Physical attackers in both VGC and Smogon formats. It provides reliable Fighting-type coverage and serves as a hard counter to "Screen" based defensive cores (e.g., Grimmsnarl or Alolan Ninetales setups).
* **Legacy Context:** While it has taught Brick Break since Gen III, in Generation I TM31 taught **Mimic**, and in Generation II it taught **Mud-Slap**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove) or given by NPCs in early-to-mid game locations (e.g., Oreburgh Gate in Sinnoh or Sootopolis City in Hoenn). In recent generations like *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Its availability is strictly tied to overworld exploration, gym leader rewards, or specialized shops.
* **Context:** TM31 is often the first reliable Fighting-type coverage move accessible to non-Fighting types (such as Normal, Ground, or Dragon types), making it a vital asset for clearing early-game Steel or Rock-type roadblocks.
