## Identity & Utility
**Carrot Seeds** is a **Plot-Advancement** item introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** Specialized seeds meant to be planted in specific soil plots within the Crown Tundra. They are a non-consumable quest item that dictates the branching path of a legendary encounter. While the internal cost is listed, it functions as a **Special Acquisition** item that cannot be purchased with standard currency in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically obtained via an exchange of **8 Dynite Ore** in Freezington).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When planted in one of two specific locations, the seeds grow into a carrot that determines which legendary steed Calyrex will summon:
    * **Old Cemetery:** Grows a **Shaderoot Carrot**, leading to the acquisition of the Ghost-type **Spectrier**.
    * **Snowslide Slope:** Grows an **Iced Carrot**, leading to the acquisition of the Ice-type **Glastrier**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a purely narrative/quest-based item. However, it is essential for players to obtain **Calyrex-Shadow** or **Calyrex-Ice**, both of which are Tier-0 threats in Restricted Legendary formats (VGC).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It serves as a permanent choice-lock for the player's save file regarding which form of Calyrex becomes available.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained from an NPC in **Freezington** after the player has moved the plot forward by finding the "King of Bountiful Harvests" and obtaining the Crown Tundra's "Legendary Note 1."
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique key-utility item provided through NPC interaction.
* **Lore Context:** These seeds represent the restoration of Calyrex's power. Without the seeds and the subsequent harvest, the "King of Bountiful Harvests" remains unable to summon his loyal steed.
