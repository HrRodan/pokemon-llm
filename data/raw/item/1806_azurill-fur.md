## Identity & Utility
**Azurill Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of soft, blue fur dropped by members of the Azurill evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting reagent used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be purchased from standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common Reagent**). In the context of League Points (LP), its value for exchange is typically low, reflecting the commonality of the Pokémon that drop it.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Once used in a recipe, the fur is consumed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials in this category cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in a competitive battle environment. Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle preparation phase for teaching moves to a team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While Azurill is a Baby Pokémon, this fur is **not** a "Baby Trigger" for breeding (unlike the Sea Incense). It is also not an evolution item; Azurill evolves via High Friendship.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Azurill line.
* **Wild Drops:** Commonly gathered by battling:
    * **Azurill**
    * **Marill**
    * **Azumarill**
* **Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, Azurill Fur is considered a basic material. It is most notably used in the early-to-mid game for crafting moves such as **TM022 (Chilling Water)** and **TM077 (Waterfall)**, reflecting the Water/Fairy-type characteristics of the source Pokémon.
