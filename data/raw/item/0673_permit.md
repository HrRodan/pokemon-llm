## Identity & Utility
**Permit** is a **Key Item** (Gameplay category) introduced in **Generation V** (specifically *Pokémon Black 2 & White 2*).
* **Description:** A specialized boarding pass or authorization document required to gain entry to the **Nature Preserve**, a remote area not found on standard maps of the Unova region. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to a flight from Mistralton City to the Nature Preserve. Upon showing this permit to the NPC at the Mistralton City cargo service, the player is flown to an exclusive zone teeming with rare Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression-based utility item used exclusively in the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. It serves strictly as a gatekeeper for post-game content.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Black 2 & White 2*, the Permit is awarded to the player by **Professor Juniper** after they have successfully **seen every Pokémon in the Unova Pokédex** (excluding Mythical Pokémon like Victini, Keldeo, Meloetta, and Genesect).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time reward for Pokédex completion.
* **World Knowledge:** The Permit is highly coveted by collectors and completionists because the Nature Preserve it unlocks contains a **guaranteed Shiny Haxorus** (Level 60), making this item the "key" to one of the few fixed Shiny encounters in the series.
