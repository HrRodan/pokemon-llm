## Identity & Utility
**Jaw Fossil** is a **Dex-completion / Fossil Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A piece of a prehistoric Pokémon's jaw that once inhabited the land. It is a **Consumable/Single-use** item that, when taken to a specific research facility (such as the Fossil Lab in Ambrette Town), can be regenerated into a living Pokémon. While it has a defined cost, it is typically acquired through exploration or mining rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High Resale Value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When processed by a fossil-revival NPC, the Jaw Fossil is consumed to create the Pokémon **Tyrunt** (Level 20 in its debut generation).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High damage output; notably powerful for a non-combative item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The fossil itself holds no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it provides no passive buffs. Its value lies entirely in the Pokémon it produces—**Tyrantrum**—which is known for its "Strong Jaw" and "Rock Head" abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the exclusive precursor to the **Tyrunt** evolutionary line. It cannot be used to trigger evolution in existing Pokémon; it is strictly for resurrection.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Kalos:** Found in Glittering Cave. The player must choose between the **Jaw Fossil** and the **Sail Fossil**, making it a version-exclusive choice within a single playthrough.
    * **Later Generations:** Can often be found via mining minigames (e.g., Grand Underground in BDSP) or through specific rare-item merchants and hidden item spots (e.g., Dusty Bowl in Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through geological exploration or the **Pickup** ability in specific high-level brackets in later games.
* **Lore:** The Jaw Fossil represents the predatory nature of ancient Pokémon, specifically the lineage of the "Tyrant King" Pokémon, Tyrantrum, which ruled the world 100 million years ago.
