## Identity & Utility
**Blastoisinite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos Region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized evolutionary stone. When held by a Blastoise, it enables the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle, drastically increasing its stats and altering its ability. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is not consumed upon use but is restricted to one Mega Evolution per team per battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through special events, gifted by NPCs, or exchanged for BP in post-game facilities).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Blastoise, the player can trigger Mega Evolution at the start of a turn. This transforms Blastoise into **Mega Blastoise**, granting it the ability **Mega Launcher** (which boosts the power of pulse and aura moves by 50%) and significantly increasing its Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: In standard play, Mega Stones cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by the correct Pokémon, and they cannot be *Flung* once Mega Evolution has occurred).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple** (Gen VI–VII). In competitive formats like Smogon UU/OU or VGC 2014/2016, Blastoisinite turned a standard defensive spinner into a premier "Wallbreaker." The boost to *Dark Pulse*, *Aura Sphere*, and *Water Pulse* makes it a versatile offensive threat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically interacts with **Blastoise**. It does not trigger a permanent evolution; the form reverts to base Blastoise at the end of the battle or if the Pokémon faints.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X & Y*, it is gifted by Professor Sycamore if the player chooses Squirtle, or purchasable from the Stone Emporium in Lumiose City. In *Sun & Moon/Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon*, it is obtainable at the Battle Tree for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a unique "Key-style" held item, often gathered through story progression or high-level trainer challenges.
* **Lore Context:** Mega Stones are said to be the result of ultimate energy being fired from the Ultimate Weapon 3,000 years ago, reacting with evolutionary stones. The Blastoisinite specifically resonates with the biological frequency of Blastoise.
