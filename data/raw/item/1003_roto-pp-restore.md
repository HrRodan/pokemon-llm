## Identity & Utility
**Roto PP Restore** is a **Consumable Medicine (Rotom Power)** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** One of the specialized "Rotom Powers" unique to the Alola region. It is a consumable battle-support item that is used during combat to sustain a Pokémon's longevity. It cannot be purchased through traditional Poke Marts, marking it as a special reward item.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via special mechanic).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Fully restores the Power Points (PP) of all moves for the Pokémon currently in battle. This is functionally superior to a Max Elixir, as it targets the active combatant specifically through the Rotom Dex interface.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Illegal.** Rotom Powers are strictly limited to the single-player campaign of *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. They are banned in all standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon, Battle Tree) as they represent an external intervention mechanic rather than a standard held item or move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a manifestation of the bond between the trainer and the **Rotom Dex**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained through the **Roto Loto** mini-game in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. Players trigger this by interacting with the Rotom Dex on the bottom screen when its eyes flash gold.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a digital/energy-based item generated by the Rotom Dex itself.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of PP-restoration, the Roto PP Restore sits at the top of the tier list for single-player utility, providing a "Full Restore" equivalent for move usage that is typically very scarce in the Pokémon world.
