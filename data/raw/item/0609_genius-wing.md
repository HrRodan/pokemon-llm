## Identity & Utility
**Genius Wing** is a **Vitamin** (specifically a Feather/Wing sub-type) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An item for use on a Pokémon that slightly increases its Special Attack base points (Effort Values). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used from the bag on a Pokémon in the overworld. While it has a defined cost, it is typically acquired through foraging rather than standard shops.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it increases its **Special Attack Effort Values (EVs) by 1**. Unlike the high-tier vitamin *Calcium* (which grants 10 EVs), the Genius Wing allows for granular, precise stat customization.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly valued by competitive players for **EV Fine-Tuning**. It is used to reach specific stat benchmarks (e.g., ensuring a OHKO on a specific threat) when a full 10-point Vitamin would overshoot the desired EV spread. It is also useful because, unlike older generations' Vitamins, Wings can be used even if a Pokémon already has more than 100 EVs in a stat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is not affected by the ability *Klutz* when used from the bag, though *Klutz* would prevent a Pokémon from using it if it were somehow held (which is not its intended use).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found in "shadows" on major bridges in the Unova region (such as the Driftveil Drawbridge and Village Bridge). In later generations like Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet, they are frequently found as sparkling glints on the ground in the Wild Area or as rewards from Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. They are most commonly gathered via **overworld exploration** or as repeatable rewards in post-game areas. In the context of "World Knowledge," these wings are often associated with the shed feathers of bird Pokémon passing over bridges.
