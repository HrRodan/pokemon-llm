## Identity & Utility
**Silk Scarf** is a **Type-enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A sumptuous, soft scarf designed to be held by a Pokémon. It is a functional held item that provides a passive offensive buff to the holder's Normal-type techniques. It is a permanent held item that is consumed only if destroyed (e.g., via Knock Off) or stolen.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the power of the holder’s **Normal-type moves** is increased by **20%**. This is a multiplicative modifier applied during damage calculation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **niche offensive item**. It is primarily used on Pokémon that rely heavily on powerful Normal-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves—such as **Extreme Speed**, **Double-Edge**, or **Boomburst**—when the trainer wants to avoid the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking restriction of a Choice Band. It is a staple for "Extreme Killer" Arceus sets in certain formats or on Belly Drum Linoone.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It is part of the "Type-Enhancer" item family (e.g., Mystic Water, Charcoal, Miracle Seed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in early-to-mid-game locations as an overworld item (e.g., from an NPC in Dewford Town or as a reward in the Fan Club). It can also be purchased in certain departmental stores or via the Battle Frontier/Subway for BP in various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a rare find in the wild, occasionally held by **Trubbish** and **Garbodor**. Trainers can use moves like **Thief** or **Covet**, or the **Pickup** ability, to farm this item from these specific species.
