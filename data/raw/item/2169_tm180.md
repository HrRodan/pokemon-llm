## Identity & Utility
**TM180 (Gyroball)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask)**.
* **Description:** A single-use teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Gyroball**. It is a **Consumable Machine** that follows the Generation IX crafting mechanic. While it cannot be purchased with standard currency, it is synthesized using League Points (LP) and specific wild Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; Crafted via the TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Gyroball** to a compatible Pokémon. Gyroball is a Physical Steel-type move whose power is calculated based on the Speed stat of the user relative to the target. The formula is: *Power = 25 × (Target Speed / User Speed)*, capped at a maximum base power of 150.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs are generally not used with Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **high-tier niche move** for Trick Room teams or naturally sluggish Pokémon. It is the primary offensive tool for slow Steel-types (like **Bronzong**, **Forretress**, or **Orthworm**) to punish fast, fragile Sweepers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be remade indefinitely provided the trainer has the necessary materials.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically added to the TM Machine catalog during the **Teal Mask DLC (Kitakami region)**. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground in Kitakami or unlocked for crafting after defeating specific trainers or finding the TM in the overworld.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To synthesize TM180, trainers typically require:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Bronzor Fragments**
    * **3x Magnemite Surges**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; materials are instead gathered by defeating wild **Bronzor**, **Bronzong**, **Magnemite**, or **Magneton** (often optimized via the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature).
