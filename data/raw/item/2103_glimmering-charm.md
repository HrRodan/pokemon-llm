## Identity & Utility
**Glimmering Charm** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation IX (The Indigo Disk DLC)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, radiant charm that glows with a crystalline light. It is a **Key Item** that functions as a permanent passive multiplier for resource gathering. As a Key Item, it **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the volume of **Tera Shards** rewarded upon completing Tera Raid Battles. When a player possesses this item, they receive **10 additional Tera Shards** of the defeated Raid Pokémon's Tera Type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no direct effect in a Pokémon battle, it is considered a **critical meta-game tool**. By significantly reducing the grind required to accumulate 50 shards, it allows competitive players to change their Pokémon's Tera Types much faster for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It acts as a passive "Quality of Life" buff once added to the player's Bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an endgame reward for completionists. It is obtained from **Director Cyrano** at the Blueberry Academy after the player has successfully registered all **240 Pokémon** in the **Blueberry Pokédex**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique reward tied to Pokédex completion. Its existence reinforces the theme of the Terarium as a site of advanced Terastal energy research.
