## Identity & Utility
**TM145** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** as part of the *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk* DLC expansion.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Water Pledge**. In the context of the Paldea/Blueberry Academy region, TMs are craftable data discs that are consumed upon use but can be remade at any TM Machine if the player has the required materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Acquisition is tied to exploration within the Terarium or crafting using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Water Pledge**. This is a Water-type Special move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly specialized for **Double Battles (VGC)**. Water Pledge is one of the three "Pledge" moves (alongside Fire and Grass). When used in the same turn as another Pledge move, it creates a "Combo Move" effect:
        * **With Grass Pledge:** Creates a **Swamp** on the opponent's side, reducing their Speed by 75% for four turns.
        * **With Fire Pledge:** Creates a **Rainbow** on the user's side, doubling the probability of secondary effects (e.g., flinching or status conditions) for four turns.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, this move is historically restricted to **Water-type Starter Pokémon** (e.g., Blastoise, Primarina, Quaquaval).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy). Once obtained, it is unlocked in the TM Machine's crafting database.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM145, the player typically requires:
    * **8,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3 Alomomola Mucus**
    * **3 Luvdisc Scales**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured technological item used by trainers to expand a Pokémon's move pool beyond its natural leveling progression.
