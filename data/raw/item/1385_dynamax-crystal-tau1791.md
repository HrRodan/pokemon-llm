## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1791** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear. The encounter remains active until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be obtained through standard gameplay or Pokémon Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal placeholder cost; it is **not for sale** via traditional means and is typically acquired via promotional serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone structure in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is emitted. This allows the player to challenge a specific Pokémon—historically associated with promotional distributions like Gigantamax Corviknight or other rare encounters—in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item functions exclusively as an encounter-triggering tool for the overworld and has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but provides a guaranteed method to encounter specific Pokémon that may possess the **Gigantamax Factor**, which cannot be obtained through standard breeding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily through **real-world retail promotions** (e.g., serial codes from GameStop, Best Buy, or Pokémon Center events). It is not available in the base game or DLC through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-exclusive utility item.
* **Location Specificity:** The item is hard-coded to function only at the **Watchtower Lair**. Attempting to use it elsewhere in the Wild Area or at other Power Spots will have no effect.
