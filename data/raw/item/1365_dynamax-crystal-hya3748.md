## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (HYA3748)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A special event-exclusive consumable used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While it has a technical internal cost, it is primarily obtained via serial codes and cannot be restocked in Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the player can use this item to trigger a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Hydreigon**. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Competitive.** The item itself has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles; its value lies in providing access to a high-IV or Hidden Ability Pokémon that can later be trained for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environmental mechanic. Once the crystal is used and the raid is completed, the item is consumed and removed from the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (HYA3748) was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events (often tied to pre-orders, magazine distributions like *CoroCoro*, or retail partnerships). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly artificial/event-based resource.
* **World Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces which summon random raids, these "coded" crystals act as a beacon for a guaranteed species encounter, bypasssing the standard RNG of the Wild Area dens.
