## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA3323** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Encounter Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a designated Pokémon to appear as a raid boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; technically "Cheap," but functionally an **Event-Exclusive Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activation at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area) initiates a **Max Raid Battle**. This allows the player to encounter and attempt to catch a specific Pokémon that may not be normally available in that location or version of the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. Its value lies in providing access to specific Pokémon, which may possess Hidden Abilities (HAs), high Individual Values (IVs), or Gigantamax factors required for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a beacon for the Dynamax phenomenon. It bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces at the specific Watchtower Lair location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or GAME) or as pre-order bonuses for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. This specific crystal (UMA3323) is part of a series of "UMA" (Universal Max Raid) codes. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an event-only digital item that is added directly to the "Other Items" pocket of the bag.
* **World Context:** In Galar lore, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated clusters of Galar Particles. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which attract random Pokémon to any Den, these specific crystals are "tuned" to a specific Pokémon's frequency, forcing an encounter at the otherwise dormant Watchtower Lair.
