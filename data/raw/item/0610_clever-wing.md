## Identity & Utility
**Clever Wing** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized feather-like item used to enhance a Pokémon's potential. It slightly increases the Special Defense effort values (EVs) of a single Pokémon. Unlike traditional Vitamins (like Zinc), it provides a smaller, more precise increment, making it ideal for fine-tuning competitive stats.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon, it increases its **Special Defense Effort Values (EVs) by 1**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly valued for **precise EV training**. While traditional vitamins (Zinc) provide 10 EVs, the Clever Wing allows trainers to reach specific stat benchmarks (e.g., reaching exactly 252 EVs or hitting a specific number for Survival/Special Bulk calculations) without overshooting the limit. Notably, since Generation VIII, Wings can be used to raise EVs even if the stat has already surpassed 100, a restriction that once limited traditional Vitamins.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a metabolic enhancer. It is categorized under the "Wing" or "Feather" family of items (including Health, Muscle, Resist, Genius, and Swift Wings).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as hidden items or "shimmering" spots on bridges in the Unova region (specifically **Driftveil Bridge** and **Marvelous Bridge**). In later generations (Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet), they are frequently obtained as rewards from Max Raid Battles, Tera Raid Battles, or as repeatable pickups in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. However, they are often gathered in bulk by players using the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets or by scavenging in areas where bird Pokémon congregate. In the game world, these are often described as feathers dropped by passing Pokémon flying over bridges.
