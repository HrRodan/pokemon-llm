## Identity & Utility
**Lagreat-ball (Hisuian Great Ball)** is a **Standard Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** An intermediate-tier Poké Ball utilized specifically within the Hisui region. It features a specialized steam-powered design characteristic of the era. It is a **Consumable** capture item that is primarily crafted rather than purchased through traditional modern Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale** in standard currency; primarily obtained through crafting or specific Hisuian vendors using local currency/merit points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides an improved catch rate compared to the standard Hisuian Poké Ball. It is used by throwing it at a wild Pokémon in the overworld or during a battle sequence. In the context of *Legends: Arceus*, it is particularly effective for mid-level encounters.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move Fling does not exist in the Hisui region mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusive to the single-player environment of *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* and cannot be held or used in standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats, as held items are not a mechanic in its debut game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is categorized as a "Standard Ball" despite its unique historical design.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hisui region, the recipe is unlocked after reaching **Member Rank 3** in the Galaxy Expedition Team. It is crafted using **1 Apricorn, 1 Iron Chunk, and 1 Tumblestone**. It can also be purchased from the General Store or the Base Camp merchants once the player has attained the required rank.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike modern iterations of the series, items in the Hisui region are gathered from the environment (ore deposits, trees) or crafted, rather than farmed from wild Pokémon via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** This ball represents the technological midpoint of the Hisui era’s capture devices, sitting between the basic Poké Ball and the high-performance Ultra Ball. It is recognizable by its blue upper shell and the small steam hole on the top.
