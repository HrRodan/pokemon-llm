## Identity & Utility
**TM227 (Hard Press)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that imparts the move **Hard Press** to compatible Pokémon. As a TM in the Paldea/Blueberry Academy era, it is a single-use item that can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration or crafted at the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hard Press**. 
    * **Move Type:** Steel (Physical).
    * **Move Mechanic:** This move deals more damage the more HP the target has remaining. The base power is calculated as `100 × (Current HP / Max HP)`, with a minimum base power of 1.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be Flung in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Tactical.** Hard Press provides reliable Steel-type coverage for physical attackers. It is particularly effective for heavy hitters to use against bulky opponents at full health, though it is often outperformed by *Heavy Slam* (if the user is heavy) or *Iron Head* (for consistent damage/flinch chance). It is most relevant in the VGC and Smogon formats for Pokémon that lack better Steel-type physical options.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a variety of "heavy" or "metallic" Pokémon, such as Metagross, Iron Hands, and Orthworm.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Terarium (Blueberry Academy)** via the *The Indigo Disk* DLC. The recipe is typically unlocked after defeating specific trainers or finding the TM in the wild within the Canyon or Steel-themed biomes.
* **Crafting Requirements:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, crafting this TM requires:
    * **8,000 LP**
    * **Orthworm Tarnish (x3)**
    * **Varoom Sections (x3)**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon; obtained strictly through crafting or overworld pickups in the Terarium.
