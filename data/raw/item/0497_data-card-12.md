## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 12** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver).
* **Description:** It is a specialized record-keeping item used to archive performance data within the Pokéathlon. Unlike standard consumable items, this is a permanent data entry tool that tracks the specific number of times a trainer’s Pokémon have "messed up" (fumbled or failed) during events. It is a **Key-style Record** item that **cannot** be bought with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired via special exchange).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the total number of times the trainer’s Pokémon have "messed up" during Pokéathlon competitions. This serves as a specialized stat-tracker for players aiming to document their full competitive history in the Pokéathlon Dome.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it exists outside the standard inventory for combat).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. It is strictly a "flavor" and completionist item for the Pokéathlon side-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it is not a holdable item in a combat context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, this item is obtained at the **Pokéathlon Dome**. It is purchased from the Athlete Shop (specifically the Point Exchange) using **Athlete Points (AP)** rather than Poké Dollars. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of "software" for the trainer's records and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability.
* **World Context:** Data Card 12 is part of a series of 27 different Data Cards. While most cards track positive achievements (like wins or points), Card 12 is unique (and somewhat humorous) for tracking the trainer's failures, providing a "low-light reel" of their Pokéathlon career.
