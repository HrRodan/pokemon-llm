## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6508** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. When used, it emits a beam of light that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle, causing a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). This low cost is typically a placeholder value for items distributed via serial codes or mystery gifts rather than standard currency transactions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Using this item at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins) activates a **Max Raid Battle**. Specifically, the **SCO6508** variant is programmed to summon **Stonjourner**. This allows players to encounter the Pokémon regardless of the current weather or standard encounter tables.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld consumable).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on competitive battle mechanics. Its utility is strictly limited to the acquisition phase of gameplay, allowing players to catch a Pokémon that may have specific IVs, Abilities, or moves for later competitive training.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **Promotional Distribution** item. Historically, Dynamax Crystals like SCO6508 were distributed via serial codes as pre-order bonuses or through special retail collaborations (such as the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield* Double Pack).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to external distribution events.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent a concentrated form of Galar Particle energy, allowing a trainer to force a "Power Spot" to activate on demand. They are rare tools used by trainers to hunt specific species that are otherwise difficult to locate in the Wild Area.
