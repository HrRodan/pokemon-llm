## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6630** is a specialized event item categorized under **Dynamax Crystals**, introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** It is a single-use consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair within the Galar Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. This specific crystal (SCO6630) is part of a series of promotional items used to encounter specific Pokémon that might otherwise be rare or exclusive to a different version.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal; however, this item is **not available for purchase** in standard marts and is typically acquired via external distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area while holding this crystal, it activates a Max Raid Battle pillar of light. This allows the player to challenge a specific Pokémon—historically associated with the **Larvitar** encounter for *Pokémon Sword* players (to compensate for its usual *Pokémon Shield* exclusivity).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld designed for Pokémon acquisition and Raiding; it provides no benefit in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the activation of the raid den, regardless of whether the raid is successfully completed or the Pokémon is caught, though the raid can be re-attempted until midnight of the day it was activated.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Code** as a promotional bonus, specifically tied to the *Pokémon Sword and Shield Dual Pack* or specific retail pre-order bonuses. It cannot be found through normal gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is an "Event-only" inventory item and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or other thieving mechanics.
* **Context:** The "SCO" prefix in the internal name refers to "Serial Code Only," highlighting its status as a limited-time distribution intended to drive early adoption of the Generation VIII titles.
