## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax-Crystal-Peg8905** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event-trigger item that interacts specifically with the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It is a single-use utility item that allows players to force a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but functionally not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player is at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), using this item causes a specific Pokémon—designated by the internal ID "peg8905"—to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. This encounter persists until the end of the calendar day or until the raid is completed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a competitive battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is limited to the overworld for the purpose of catching Pokémon, which may then be used in competitive play depending on their species, IVs, or Hidden Abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item serves as a "Star Challenge" trigger. It is consumed upon use and requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription (or local players) if the user wishes to complete the resulting raid with others.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are generally **Event-only** items. They were typically distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop or Pokémon Center pre-orders) or special promotions. They are not found during normal exploration or in any standard Galar shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item cannot be found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to the Galar region's Max Raid mechanic and the lore of the Power Spots found within the Wild Area.
