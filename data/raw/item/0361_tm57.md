## Identity & Utility
**TM57 (Charge Beam)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This item teaches the move **Charge Beam** to a compatible Pokémon. It represents a low-power, high-utility Electric-type attack. Depending on the specific game generation, it functions as either a single-use consumable or a permanent, reusable teaching tool.
* **Cost:** **1,000 Poké Dollars** (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Charge Beam**. 
    * **Move Details:** Charge Beam is a Special Electric-type move with 50 Base Power. Its defining characteristic is its **70% chance** to raise the user's **Special Attack** stat by one stage upon successful hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling, or have 0 power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Setup Utility.** While its base power is low, it is used by bulky special attackers (like **Rotom-Wash**, **Porygon-Z**, or **Magearna**) to "snowball" offensive pressure. It allows a Pokémon to deal chip damage while simultaneously fishing for a stat boost, making it a defensive-offensive hybrid choice in various Smogon tiers and VGC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, particularly Electric, Steel, and Psychic types capable of channeling electricity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In its debut (**Generation IV**), it is famously gifted by **Volkner**, the Gym Leader of Sunyshore City, upon his defeat. 
    * In later generations, it is commonly found in Department Stores (such as the Veilstone or Shopping Mall Nine) or via TM crafting stations in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon; it must be obtained via Gym rewards, overworld exploration, or Poke Mart purchases. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
