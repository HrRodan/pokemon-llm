## Identity & Utility
**Klawf Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Ambush Pokémon, Klawf. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the Technical Machine Machine. While it has a listed cost, it is primarily obtained through gameplay rather than purchased from a Mart.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It can also be exchanged for League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific reagent in the **TM Machine** located at Pokémon Centers. It is a required component for crafting various Technical Machines to teach Pokémon new moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it has no direct utility in battle. However, it is essential for the "pre-game" competitive loop, as it is required to craft high-value TMs like **TM088 (Swords Dance)**, **TM105 (X-Scissor)**, and **TM152 (Giga Impact)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. It exists solely within the crafting ecosystem of the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the **Paldea region**. It is acquired by defeating or catching wild **Klawf**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally held. Instead, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop upon the conclusion of an encounter with a wild **Klawf**. 
* **Farming Context:** Players typically farm this item in the **South Province (Area Three)**, particularly around the Stony Cliff Titan's lair, where Klawf are abundant. It is a foundational material for physical attackers looking to learn setup moves like Swords Dance.
