## Identity & Utility
**TM154 (Hydro Cannon)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool used to instruct a compatible Pokémon in the move **Hydro Cannon**. It is classified as an "Ultimate Move," traditionally reserved for the final evolutions of Water-type Starter Pokémon. In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, it is a craftable, single-use machine (though it can be remade at a TM Machine).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **14,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hydro Cannon**.
    *   **Move Type:** Water / Special
    *   **Power:** 150
    *   **Accuracy:** 90%
    *   **Effect:** The user attacks with a massive blast of water but must **recharge on the following turn**, making it unable to move, switch, or use items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be effectively used with Fling in Gen IX).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **Niche/High-Risk.** In competitive formats like VGC or Smogon, Hydro Cannon is generally discouraged due to the recharge turn, which grants the opponent a "free turn" to set up or knock out the user. It is occasionally used as a desperate "nuke" on Hyper Offense teams or in specific "Z-Move" style contexts in previous generations, but in Gen IX, more consistent moves like *Hydro Pump* or *Surf* are preferred.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This TM is highly restrictive. It can only be learned by **fully evolved Water-type Starter Pokémon** (e.g., Blastoise, Feraligatr, Swampert, Empoleon, Samurott, Greninja, Primarina, Inteleon, and Quaquaval).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Blueberry Academy** (Indigo Disk DLC). It can be obtained as a reward for exploration or by defeating specific Trainers in the Terarium. 
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once unlocked, it can be crafted at any TM Machine using:
    *   **14,000 LP**
    *   **3x Totodile Scales**
    *   **3x Froakie Mucus**
    *   **3x Quaxly Feathers**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial device manufactured for training purposes.
