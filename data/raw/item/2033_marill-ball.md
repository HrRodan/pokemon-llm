## Identity & Utility
**Marill Ball** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A recreational toy themed after the Water/Fairy-type Pokémon Marill. It is a reusable overworld item used exclusively during the Picnic mechanic. While it carries a functional price tag, it serves a purely cosmetic and social purpose within the game's friendship-building systems.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Mid-range for recreational gear).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a Picnic, the Marill Ball can be deployed. The player and their Pokémon can interact with the ball by walking into it or kicking it. It serves as a tool to increase engagement with the party and provide visual flair during social sessions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling stats).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a "flavor" item used for roleplay and overworld interaction. It provides no statistical advantages in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the physics engine of the Gen IX Picnic mode, allowing Pokémon to chase or push the object around the picnic area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased at **Picnics-Knacks** establishments located in major hubs across the Paldea region (such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured consumer good intended for trainers to use for leisure.
* **Context:** The Marill Ball is part of a series of collectible balls (including the standard Poke Ball, Great Ball, and various Pokémon-themed balls) that allow trainers to customize their "Play" experience during picnics, reflecting the trainer's aesthetic preference.
