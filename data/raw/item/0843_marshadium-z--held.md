## Identity & Utility
**Marshadium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized, crystallized form of Z-Power designed specifically for the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow. It is a **Held Item** that acts as a catalyst for a unique Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Acquisition** that cannot be bought or sold at Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is typically obtained through special events or specific NPC distributions in the Alola region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Marshadow that knows the move **Spectral Thief**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the signature Z-Move: **Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Impactful (Niche).** In formats where Marshadow is legal (such as Smogon Ubers or specific BSS formats), this item is a premier choice. Marshadow’s *Spectral Thief* already steals an opponent's stat boosts before dealing damage; upgrading this to a **195 Base Power** Physical Ghost-type Z-Move allows Marshadow to effectively delete wall-breakers and defensive pivots alike.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Item Protection:** Like all Z-Crystals, this item **cannot be removed** by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, and it cannot be traded away during battle via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*. 
    * **Requirement:** The item remains inert if held by any Pokémon other than Marshadow, or if Marshadow does not have *Spectral Thief* in its active move set.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, this item was distributed alongside the Marshadow event. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it can be obtained from an NPC in Heahea City (the Tide Song Hotel) if the player has Marshadow in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique "one-per-save" special item tied to the lore of Mythical Pokémon and the Z-Power of the Alola region.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents the pinnacle of Marshadow's combat potential, focusing its spectral energy into a series of rapid-fire strikes that overwhelm the target’s soul.
