## Identity & Utility
**Metronome** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An item designed to reward momentum and move-locking. It gradually increases the power of a move as long as it is used consecutively. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be bought or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-tier pricing**; typically available in large department stores like Veilstone City or Celadon City).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held, the power of a move increases by **10%** of its original damage for each consecutive turn it is used. This multiplier stacks up to a **maximum of 100%** (double damage) after 10 turns. The counter resets if the holder uses a different move, switches out, or the move fails/misses.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **niche/specialized item**. While it lacks the immediate power of a Life Orb (1.3x) or Choice Specs/Band (1.5x), it is superior for long-term sweeps where a Pokémon is locked into a single move. It has unique synergy with moves that already have a power-increasing mechanic, such as **Echoed Voice**, **Fury Cutter**, or **Rollout**, and is occasionally used on bulky "Setup Sweepers" that can survive multiple turns.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a performance-enhancing tool for battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Frequently found in major regional Department Stores (Generation IV–IX) or gifted by NPCs interested in music/rhythm.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously associated with musical or rhythmic Pokémon. It can be found with a 5% rarity on wild **Kricketot**, **Kricketune**, and **Chatot**. Trainers can efficiently farm these items using the **Thief** move or the **Pickup** ability.
