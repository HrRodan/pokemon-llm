## Identity & Utility
**Loaded Dice** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized tactical tool designed to manipulate the outcome of multi-strike moves. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought at high-end retail locations. It significantly reduces the randomness associated with "2-to-5 hit" moves, ensuring a more consistent damage floor.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, moves that normally strike 2–5 times (such as *Icicle Spear*, *Bullet Seed*, *Rock Blast*, *Scale Shot*, and *Pin Missile*) will always hit at least 4 times. For the move *Population Bomb*, it changes the mechanic to perform a single accuracy check; if successful, the move hits 4–10 times. For *Triple Axel*, it ensures all three hits are more likely to connect provided the first hit lands.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** This item revolutionized the viability of multi-hit attackers in VGC and Smogon formats. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like **Baxcalibur** (Icicle Spear/Glaive Rush), **Breloom** (Bullet Seed), and **Great Tusk** or **Roaring Moon** (Scale Shot). It provides the power of a Choice item without the move-locking drawback, provided the user has a multi-hit move in their kit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a pure combat-enhancement item. It pairs exceptionally well with the **Technician** ability (on Pokémon like Breloom/Cinccino) to create devastatingly high-base-power turns.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased at **Delibird Presents** branches (specifically the Levincia branch in Paldea) after the player has earned a sufficient number of Gym Badges. It can also be obtained as a reward for defeating Trainers in certain Provinces (e.g., East Province Area One).
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not found on any wild Pokémon. It is considered a modern, manufactured tool rather than a natural resource, reflecting its high retail price and specific mechanical function.
