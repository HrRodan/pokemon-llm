## Identity & Utility
**X-Defense 3** is a **Miracle-Shooter** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized battle-enhancement tool that drastically raises a Pokémon's Defense. Unlike standard X-Items, it is a high-tier variant specifically designed for use within the **Wonder Launcher** (Miracle Shooter) mechanic in multiplayer battles. It is a **Consumable** item that exists only within the context of active battles and cannot be used in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired by spending accumulated points during Wonder Launcher-enabled battles rather than being purchased at a Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during battle, it **raises the target's Defense stat by three stages**. This provides a 250% increase to the physical Defense stat. Like all stat modifiers, the effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out of battle or faints.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Standard/Niche.** This item is exclusive to the "Wonder Launcher" battle mode in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. Because standard competitive formats (VGC and Smogon) disable the Wonder Launcher, this item has no presence in traditional competitive play. It is essentially a high-cost tactical "power-up" for casual multiplayer matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it cannot be held outside of the Miracle Shooter interface.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available during battles where the **Wonder Launcher** setting is enabled. Players must wait for their point gauge to fill during the match to "purchase" and use the item instantly. It is not found in the game world, hidden items, or shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital construct of the Unova region's advanced battle technology rather than a physical object found in nature.
