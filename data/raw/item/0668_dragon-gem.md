## Identity & Utility
**Dragon Gem** is a **Jewel** (Competitive Held Item) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized held item infused with draconic essence. It acts as a single-use power booster for Dragon-type attacks. Once the holder executes a damaging Dragon-type move, the gem shatters to amplify the damage. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically priced but rarely found in standard retail marts.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though typically acquired through exploration rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Dragon-type move, the power of that move is increased by **1.5×** (in Generation V mechanics) and the item is consumed immediately.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems generally cannot be used with Fling or have 0 base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Context-Specific).** In Generation V, Gems were a staple in VGC and Smogon formats, allowing Pokémon like Latios or Haxorus to secure "One-Hit Knockouts" (OHKOs) that would otherwise be impossible. In later generations, the multiplier was nerfed to 1.3×, and the Dragon Gem specifically became unavailable in standard play (remaining unreleased in most Gen VI+ titles).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the ability **Unburden**; once the Dragon Gem is consumed, the Pokémon's Speed is doubled. It also bypasses the negative effects of **Klutz**, though a Pokémon with Klutz cannot activate the gem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in the **Unova region**. It is most commonly retrieved from **Dust Clouds** inside caves (such as Victory Road or Chargestone Cave). In later titles, it is often restricted to special events or specific battle facility rewards (like the Battle Maison/Tree).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon in standard encounters. It is primarily gathered through environmental RNG mechanics (Dust Clouds) or found as a hidden item. In the context of "Jewels," it represents the raw elemental energy of Dragon-types crystallized into a physical form.
