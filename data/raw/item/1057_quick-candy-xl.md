## Identity & Utility
**Quick Candy XL** is a **Vitamin (Stat-Enhancement Candy)** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized, high-tier nutrient designed for late-game optimization. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used from the bag to permanently increase a Pokémon's Speed stat. Unlike standard vitamins, it is restricted to Pokémon that have reached seniority (Level 60 or higher). 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Its low sell price reflects its status as a reward for gameplay effort rather than a luxury commercial item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon of **Level 60 or higher**, it increases that Pokémon's **Speed** stat by 1 point. In the context of *Let's Go* mechanics, this contributes to the Pokémon's **Awakening Values (AVs)**, which function differently than traditional Effort Values (EVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Held items and the move Fling do not exist in the titles where this item is present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System Specific.** This item is mandatory for "Maxing out" a Pokémon's Speed for competitive battles within the *Let's Go* ecosystem. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as the "Candy" stat system was replaced by the "EXP Candy" system in subsequent generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a three-tier hierarchy: **Quick Candy** (Any Level), **Quick Candy L** (Lv. 30+), and **Quick Candy XL** (Lv. 60+).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through the **Transfer** system; sending Speed-oriented Pokémon (such as the Pikachu, Electrode, or Aerodactyl lines) to Professor Oak yields these candies. They are also rarely obtained as rewards for catching wild Pokémon with high-quality throws or on "Stroll" via the Poké Ball Plus.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered by catching species that naturally possess high base Speed, symbolizing the extraction of that Pokémon's "essence" or "energy" into a consumable form.
