## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Def** is a **Stat-Boosting Battle Item** introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** An consumable spray-type medicine used to temporarily fortify a Pokémon's defensive capabilities. It is a **Consumable** item that is intended for use specifically during a battle. While it can be held by a Pokémon, it has no passive effect when held; it must be used by the Trainer from the Bag.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag during a battle, it raises the active Pokémon's Special Defense stat. 
    * **Stat Stages:** In modern generations (Gen VII onwards), it **sharply** raises Special Defense by **two stages (+2)**. In older generations, it raises the stat by one stage (+1).
    * **Happiness:** Using this item also provides a minor boost to the Pokémon's Friendship (Happiness) value.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Only.** Use of Bag items is prohibited in standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon) and Battle Facilities. However, it is a **staple strategy in Nuzlocke challenges**, allowing a Pokémon to "tank" hits from powerful Special Attackers that it would otherwise not survive.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The effect is temporary and wears off if the Pokémon is switched out or the battle ends. It is affected by the ability **Klutz**, which prevents the Pokémon from using or being affected by held items, though it does not prevent a trainer from using the item *on* the Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available for purchase at **Poké Marts** (usually after obtaining a certain number of Gym Badges) and specifically found in large **Department Stores** (e.g., Goldenrod, Veilstone, or Lilycove).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is most commonly gathered as "hidden items" in the overworld or purchased as a standard combat consumable.
