## Identity & Utility
**X-Speed** is a **Stat-Boost Battle Item** introduced in **Generation I** (Kanto).
* **Description:** An consumable item designed for mid-battle tactical advantages. It provides a temporary surge in the user's Speed stat. While the provided data identifies its metadata within Generation IV, it is a foundational item present in every main-series game. It is a **consumable** item that **can** be bought at most Poké Marts after obtaining a few Gym Badges.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag during a battle, it raises the active Pokémon's Speed stat. 
    * *Mechanical Evolution:* In older generations, this raised the stat by **one stage**. From Generation VII (Sun/Moon) onwards, the formula was buffed to **sharply raise** the stat by **two stages** (+100%).
    * *Happiness:* Using the item also provides a minor boost to the Pokémon's Friendship/Happiness (1/1/0 scale).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), using items from the Bag is prohibited. However, X-Speed is a **top-tier staple for Speedrunning and Nuzlocke challenges**, allowing a slower "tank" Pokémon to outspeed and sweep major boss fights (Gym Leaders/Elite Four).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Battle Item" and will have no effect if held by a Pokémon during a link battle; it must be manually used by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at **Poké Marts** and Department Stores (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Veilstone) once the player progresses past the early game. It is frequently found as "floor loot" (Item Balls) in caves and routes.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily manufactured for trainers. It is occasionally gathered by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets (depending on the game version).
* **Context:** It belongs to the "X-Item" family (alongside X-Attack, X-Defense, etc.), representing synthesized stimulants used to temporarily push a Pokémon beyond its natural limits in high-stakes trainer battles.
