## Identity & Utility
**TM01** is a Technical Machine in the **All-Machines** category, first appearing in its Generation III iteration (as per its metadata classification). 
* **Description:** TMs are data discs used to teach specific moves to compatible Pokémon. While historically a single-use consumable, their mechanics have shifted between infinite-use (Gens V-VIII) and single-use/craftable (Gen IX). As a "Machine" item, it cannot be held for a battle effect but is a critical resource for team building.
* **Cost:** 40,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). This high price point typically categorizes it as a late-game purchase or a high-tier move found in Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. The move contained in **TM01** is highly variable depending on the game version:
    * **Gen I:** Mega Punch
    * **Gen II:** Dynamic Punch
    * **Gen III–IV:** Focus Punch (The primary move identified in this record).
    * **Gen V–VI:** Hone Claws
    * **Gen VII:** Work Up
    * **LGPE:** Headbutt
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Focus Punch (Gen 3-4):** A high-risk, high-reward move (150 BP) used in the "SubPunch" strategy. It requires the user to be behind a Substitute to avoid losing focus.
        * **Hone Claws (Gen 5-6):** Used by setup sweepers (like Durant or Excadrill) to boost Attack and Accuracy.
        * **Work Up (Gen 7):** A niche setup move for mixed attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a fundamental tool for expanding a Pokémon's "Movepool," allowing them to learn attacks they would not normally learn through leveling up.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually purchased at major **Department Stores** or found in specific locations (e.g., Oreburgh Gate in Gen IV, or Silph Co. in Gen I). In Gen IX, it must be crafted using a TM Machine with specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM01 is **never held** by wild Pokémon. It is an artificial human-made device. It is generally not compatible with the **Pickup** ability in most generations, as it is considered a high-value item.
* **Context:** The move **Focus Punch** (associated with this TM's Gen III/IV ID) is iconic to the Hoenn region, often found early in the Oreburgh Gate or given by NPCs to emphasize tactical positioning in battle.
