## Identity & Utility
**Max-Ether** is a **Consumable Medicine (PP Recovery)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A high-tier medicinal spray used to fully restore the Power Points (PP) of a single move. It is a consumable item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. While it has a defined internal value, it is traditionally a rare, non-standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it completely restores the PP of one selected move to its maximum capacity. It is the direct upgrade to the standard **Ether** (which only restores 10 PP).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional status effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough & Nuzlocke Staple.** Like all medicine items, it is banned in standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon) and battle facilities (Battle Tower). However, it is invaluable in Nuzlocke challenges and "gauntlet" scenarios like the Elite Four, where PP conservation for low-PP moves (e.g., *Close Combat*, *Recover*, or *Fire Blast*) is vital for survival.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a primary target for players using the **Pickup** ability to farm rare resources.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most core-series games, Max-Ethers cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts, making them a finite resource. They are typically found as hidden items (requiring an Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine) or awarded in the late-game/post-game areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In many generations, the most reliable way to "farm" this item is through the **Pickup** ability, usually requiring a high-level Pokémon (typically Level 71–100) to move it into the common loot table.
* **Lore context:** Positioned as a potent pharmaceutical, it represents a more concentrated version of the Ether, designed for seasoned trainers managing moves with high exhaustion rates.
