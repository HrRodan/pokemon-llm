## Identity & Utility
**Diamond Tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative customization item used to change the visual appearance of the player's picnic table in the Paldea region. It features a distinct diamond-patterned aesthetic. It is a **reusable cosmetic** item that **can** be bought at specific retail outlets.
* **Cost:** 1500 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Affordable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a Picnic, they can select this item from their inventory to drape it over the table. This is a purely cosmetic change and does not affect the quality of sandwiches made, the rate of Egg discovery, or the experience points gained from the picnic session.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles. It is strictly a social and customization-based item for the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It interacts solely with the **Picnic mechanic**, allowing players to personalize their camp environment.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available for purchase at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. Unlike held items or berries, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability; it must be purchased from a vendor or obtained through specific NPC interactions or events within the Paldea region.
