## Identity & Utility
**Dedenne Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a tuft of fur dropped by a Dedenne. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon. While it has a nominal sell price, its primary utility is as a reagent for the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource Tier).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific TMs. In the Paldea region, Dedenne Fur is a necessary component for manufacturing moves consistent with Dedenne's Electric/Fairy typing.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists strictly within the "Crafting/Economy" loop of the game. It has no tactical value in VGC or Smogon formats, though it is essential for obtaining the TMs required to build competitive movesets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "Materials" pocket of the bag and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional held-item sense.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after battling a wild Dedenne (either by catching it, defeating it in battle, or using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but rather a **guaranteed drop** from the **Dedenne** evolutionary line upon encounter resolution.
* **Crafting Context:** Based on Dedenne's movepool, this fur is typically required for crafting TMs such as **TM023 (Charge Beam)**, **TM048 (Volt Switch)**, **TM082 (Thunder Wave)**, and **TM166 (Thunder)**. Its value lies in its necessity for Electric-type coverage on various team archetypes.
