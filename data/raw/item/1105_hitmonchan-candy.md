## Identity & Utility
**Hitmonchan-candy** is a **Species-candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized, energy-packed consumable used to permanently enhance the performance of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can technically be bought or sold, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay loops rather than standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Very Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When administered to a Pokémon in the **Hitmonchan** evolutionary line (including Tyrogue, provided it is destined for or currently a Hitmonchan in the context of LGPE mechanics), it increases all of the Pokémon's stats—HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed—simultaneously by 1 point.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in the games where it originates).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the "Awakened" mechanic in the *Let's Go* series. It is used to max out Awakening Values (AVs). It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as those utilize the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Species Candy" mechanic, which bypasses the standard Stat Candy (e.g., Health Candy, Mighty Candy) requirements, allowing a trainer to boost a Hitmonchan to its maximum potential more efficiently.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (LGPE) by catching wild Hitmonchan, transferring Hitmonchan to Professor Oak, or as a reward from the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is instead a reward for the "Catch Combo" mechanic; the more Hitmonchan a trainer catches in a row, the higher the yield of Hitmonchan-candy.
* **Lore Context:** Unlike Rare Candies which increase Level, or Vitamins which increase specific stats, Species Candies represent the distilled essence and training potential of a specific Pokémon type, providing a balanced growth across all physical and mental attributes.
