## Identity & Utility
**Reply-Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Specialized stationery designed specifically for responding to correspondence received from other Trainers. It is a **Consumable/Social** item that can be purchased in-game. It functions as a delivery mechanism for player-generated messages using a pre-defined vocabulary system.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer may compose a message from a finite list of words and attach it to a Pokémon. When that Pokémon is traded, the recipient can read the message. Once the message is read and erased, the item remains in the bag for reuse. Alternatively, the message can be stored in the Trainer's PC Mailbox.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Competitive/Social.** While it provides no stat boosts, Mail items have a unique mechanical property: they **cannot be removed or swapped** in battle. Moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Covet*, and *Trick* will automatically fail against a Pokémon holding Mail. Despite this niche protection, it is rarely used in competitive play as it prevents the use of viable items like Life Orb or Leftovers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Lock:** A Pokémon holding Reply-Mail **cannot be placed into the PC Storage System**. The item must be removed before the Pokémon can be deposited.
    * **Anti-Thievery:** Its primary mechanical interaction is the hard-coded immunity to item-removal effects.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in Pokémon Marts across the Unova and Kalos regions. It is often sold alongside other stationery variants like BridgeMail or BloomMail.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. 
* **Social Context:** Introduced during an era where Nintendo sought to facilitate safe, structured communication between players during trades. The "Reply-Mail" specifically encourages the "back-and-forth" social loop of the Pokémon GTS and local wireless trading features.
