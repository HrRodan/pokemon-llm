## Identity & Utility
**X Accuracy** is a **Stat-Boost Battle Item** introduced in Generation I (refined in the provided Generation IV metadata).
* **Description:** A specialized performance-enhancing tool designed for use exclusively during combat. It is a **Consumable Medicine** item that can be bought at most major Poké Marts and Department Stores. It is intended to mitigate the risk of high-power, low-accuracy moves (like Hydro Pump or Fire Blast) missing their targets.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag during a battle, it raises the active Pokémon's **Accuracy** stat. 
    * *Mechanical Evolution:* While older data specifies a one-stage increase, the provided Sun/Moon flavor text reflects the modern buff where it **sharply boosts** Accuracy by **two stages** (+100% of the base value). 
    * It also provides a minor **Happiness** increase (1/1/0) upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage with no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Only.** In standard competitive play (Smogon or VGC), items cannot be used from the Bag, rendering X Accuracy illegal. However, it is a **top-tier tool for Nuzlockes and Speedruns**, allowing players to bypass the RNG of inaccurate moves to ensure a "sweep" against Gym Leaders or the Elite Four.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its effects are negated by the ability **Klutz**, and it is lost if the Pokémon is forced out of battle (Roar/Whirlwind) or switched manually.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at **Department Stores** (such as those in Celadon, Goldenrod, or Veilstone City) and mid-to-late game Poké Marts. It is also a frequent find as a floor item in caves or industrial areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily a manufactured pharmaceutical item produced by Silph Co. or similar regional corporations. Most players acquire it via the **Pickup** ability at higher levels or through direct purchase.
