## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (COL2177)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event-utility item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. It functions as a summoner for a specific Max Raid Battle, causing a designated Pokémon (determined by the internal variable [VAR (0000)]) to appear as a Dynamax encounter. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that is generally not available for standard purchase.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; this price is a placeholder as the item is typically distributed via special events or codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, the crystal activates a Max Raid Den. This guarantees a specific encounter that remains active until the end of the day (midnight), allowing the player to challenge the designated Pokémon in a Dynamax battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer-vs-Trainer battles (VGC/Smogon). It is strictly a "Playthrough/Event" item used for catching rare Pokémon or obtaining specific Raid rewards (like Max Move materials).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Distribution Only.** Dynamax Crystals with specific "COL" or alphanumeric identifiers were historically distributed via pre-order bonuses, retail partnerships (like GameStop or Target), or special promotional codes. They are not sold in any in-game Pokémon Center or Mart.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to the player's Bag/Event inventory.
