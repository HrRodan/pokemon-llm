## Identity & Utility
**TM74 (Gyro Ball)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This machine allows a Pokémon to learn the Steel-type move **Gyro Ball**. In this move, the user tackles the target with a high-speed spin. It is a teaching tool that has transitioned from being a single-use consumable (Gens 4, 9) to a reusable item (Gens 5-8).
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Gyro Ball** to a compatible Pokémon. The move's base power is calculated based on the speed of the user relative to the target: the slower the user compared to the target, the higher the damage (capping at 150 Base Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling, or provide minimal power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Competitive Staple.** Gyro Ball is a cornerstone move for slow, bulky Steel-types such as **Ferrothorn**, **Forretress**, and **Stakataka**. It effectively turns a low Speed stat into an offensive advantage, especially when paired with a "Brave" nature and 0 Speed IVs. It is frequently seen in VGC and Smogon formats to punish fast "sweepers."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it interacts indirectly with Speed-reducing items like the **Iron Ball** or the **Macho Brace**, which are often equipped to the user to maximize Gyro Ball's damage output.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Throughout the series, TM74 is commonly found in departmental stores (like the Veilstone Department Store) or located in industrial/metallic areas (such as the Floccesy Ranch or various caves). In Generation IX, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a man-made device for move distribution. It is most frequently acquired via purchase or as a reward for exploration.
