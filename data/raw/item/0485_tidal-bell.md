## Identity & Utility
**Tidal Bell** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically for the Johto remakes, *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** An old-fashioned bell that emits a gentle, rhythmic ringing sound. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or discarded. It serves as a mystical catalyst required to progress the main narrative and encounter legendary entities.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When brought to the Kimono Girls at the Whirl Islands (or the Bell Tower depending on the version's ritual), the bell resonates to summon the Legendary Pokémon **Lugia**. It acts as the musical key to initiate the scripted encounter.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-essential item used exclusively for overworld progression and legendary encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. Its sole interaction is triggering the Kimono Girls' dance sequence, which manifests Lugia from the depths of the Whirl Islands.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Pokémon SoulSilver**: Obtained from the Director of the Goldenrod Radio Tower after defeating Team Rocket. It is mandatory for completing the main story.
    * In **Pokémon HeartGold**: Obtained from an NPC in Pewter City (Kanto) during the post-game, allowing the player to catch Lugia at a higher level.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact tied to Johto's ancient traditions and the mythology of the "Guardian of the Seas."
