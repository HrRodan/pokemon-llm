## Identity & Utility
**Mr. Mime Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically to the Mr. Mime evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item used in the overworld to permanently boost a Pokémon's performance.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its value lies in its specific stat-boosting utility rather than its resale price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a Pokémon in the Mr. Mime family (including Mime Jr. and Mr. Mime), it increases **all stats simultaneously** (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed) by 1 point. This contributes to the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* mechanics. It is not used in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it interacts with AVs rather than the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. It is vital for "Master Trainer" battles within its home games.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly affects **Mr. Mime** and **Mime Jr.** It is one of the most efficient ways to maximize a Mr. Mime's potential compared to using generic stat candies (like Health Candy or Quick Candy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild **Mr. Mime**, transferring Mr. Mime to Professor Oak, or walking with a Mr. Mime in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item in the wild. It is gathered through the **Catch Combo** mechanic or by sending Pokémon to the Professor (a "grinding" mechanic similar to Pokémon GO).
* **Context:** In the Alola-era *Let's Go* games, these candies replaced traditional training methods, representing the bond between the trainer and a specific species of Pokémon.
