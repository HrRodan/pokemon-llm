## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal DRA5744** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Dragapult**—to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Special Acquisition**). While the data lists a nominal cost, this item is functionally priceless as it is distributed via serial codes or special promotions rather than standard shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) initiates a Max Raid Battle. This allows the player to encounter and attempt to catch a specific Pokémon that may not normally appear in that location or during that time.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** The item itself has no competitive battle function. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing a guaranteed encounter with a high-rarity Pokémon (Dragapult), which often features guaranteed high IVs and the potential for a Hidden Ability, making it an essential tool for breeding or training competitive-ready team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region. It does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily made available through **serial code distributions** (such as those through retailers like GameStop or special promotional events). Once used, the crystal is consumed, and the raid persists until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch system clock reaches midnight.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a "promotional key item" that exists outside the standard gameplay loop of catching and looting.
