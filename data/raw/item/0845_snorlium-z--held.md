## Identity & Utility
**Snorlium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically keyed to the biology of Snorlax. It is a **Unique Held Item** that cannot be sold or traded. Unlike generic Z-Crystals (like Normalium Z), this is a species-specific crystal that grants access to a signature Z-Move.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired via special event or specific in-game NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Snorlax** that knows the move **Giga Impact**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Pulverizing Pancake**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed by Knock Off or stolen via Thief/Covet).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact "nuke" strategy used in Generation VII formats. **Pulverizing Pancake** is a Physical Normal-type move with a massive **210 Base Power**. It was often used to secure a one-hit knockout (OHKO) on bulky threats that Snorlax otherwise couldn't break through. Its viability is limited by the fact that it requires Snorlax to run Giga Impact, a move that is otherwise detrimental due to its recharge turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-enhancement tool. It functions only if the trainer possesses a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it was originally distributed as an event item alongside a special Munchlax. 
    * In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it can be obtained from an NPC in the Tidewhisper Inn in Heahea City after showing them a Snorlax.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique Key-Item-style held object that remains in the player's "Z-Crystals" pocket when not in use.
