## Identity & Utility
**Claw Fossil** is a **Dex-Completion / Evolution Item** introduced in Generation III (though the provided data highlights its integration in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A prehistoric relic representing a fragment of a claw from an ancient seafaring Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Key Resource** that is consumed upon use to regenerate extinct species. While it has a high internal price, it is generally found through exploration rather than purchased at a standard Poké Mart.
* **Cost:** 7000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Valuable Resource**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specific scientific facility—such as the **Mining Museum in Oreburgh City**, the **Museum of Science in Pewter City**, or the **Devon Corporation in Rustboro City**—it can be revived into the Rock/Bug-type Pokémon **Anorith**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100. This is a very high base power for the move Fling, making it a powerful (though costly) projectile in emergency battle scenarios.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. Its value lies exclusively in the **Anorith/Armaldo** line it produces. Armaldo is known in lower-tier competitive brackets for its high Attack and access to Rapid Spin.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item serves as the "trigger" for obtaining Anorith. In various games, it is often paired as a choice against the **Root Fossil** (which produces Lileep), forcing players to choose one per playthrough.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through environmental interaction. In the Sinnoh region, it is a common find in the **Grand Underground** (specifically in *Pokémon Diamond* and *Brilliant Diamond*). In Hoenn, it is found in the **Mirage Tower** or on **Route 111**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered via the **Underground Mining** mechanic or specific scripted events in the overworld. It is highly sought after by collectors and researchers within the Pokémon world to study the biological history of the ocean.
