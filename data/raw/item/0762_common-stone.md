## Identity & Utility
**Common Stone** is an **Unused/Dummy Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** Described as a "perfectly normal stone" that might appear valuable depending on the observer. It functions as a placeholder or flavor-text item within the game's code. It is a **Key-type/Special item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or used in standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is purely theoretical/flavor-based.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item has **no functional effect** in battle or the overworld. Its internal coding lists the effect as "Unknown," confirming its status as an unimplemented or "dummy" asset.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is not present in the competitive pool for VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be legally obtained or held by a Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution for any known Pokémon and has no interaction with abilities like Pickup, Klutz, or Sticky Hold.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unavailable** through standard gameplay. It exists within the data of *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon* but was never distributed via Mystery Gift or placed in a reachable overworld location.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** Similar to other "flavor" items (like the *Strange Souvenir* or *Pretty Feather*), the Common Stone serves as a world-building asset. Its description—suggesting value is "in the eye of the beholder"—is a common trope in Pokémon games used for items that exist solely to be sold (like Nuggets) or to hint at scrapped side-quests. However, because it has a cost of 0, it lacks even the utility of a "vendor junk" item.
