## Identity & Utility
**Star Sweet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A star-shaped confectionery used specifically to trigger a unique evolution path. It is a consumable held item that is generally used during the overworld "spin" mechanic rather than in direct combat.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Milcery**, the player can perform a "Spin" (by rotating the movement stick) to evolve Milcery into **Alcremie**. The specific duration, direction, and time of day of the spin, combined with the Star Sweet, determines the final color and flavor of the Alcremie, which will feature star-shaped decorations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no secondary effect when thrown in battle.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Cosmetic. While Alcremie has competitive utility as a support Pokémon (using its signature move *Decorate* or the *Sweet Veil* ability), the Star Sweet itself is consumed upon evolution and has no impact on stats or competitive performance beyond determining Alcremie's aesthetic form.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a mandatory catalyst for obtaining the Star-shaped variant of Alcremie. Unlike traditional Evolution Stones, it requires a specific player action (spinning) while the item is held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, Star Sweets are primarily obtained as rewards for defeating **Battle Cafe** masters (in Motostoke, Hammerlocke, and Wyndon). They can also be produced via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC. In Generation IX, they can be found in the Terarium (Blueberry Academy) or via the **Item Printer**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally distributed as a prize for culinary-themed challenges or found as a rare sparkling item in specific "sweet" themed environments like the Berry Forest or the Milcery-populated areas of the Terarium.
