## Identity & Utility
**Gold-teeth** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (re-indexed in Generation III for FireRed/LeafGreen).
* **Description:** A set of golden false teeth lost by the Safari Zone’s Warden in Fuchsia City. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be discarded, sold, or given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique quest item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a critical quest component. When returned to the Safari Zone Warden in Fuchsia City, he rewards the player with **HM04 (Strength)** (or the Secret Technique "Strong Push" in *Let's Go* versions). Returning the teeth also allows the Warden to speak clearly, progressing his personal dialogue.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and story advancement.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for unlocking the ability to move heavy boulders in the overworld. Without this item, the player cannot obtain the HM for Strength, which is required to navigate locations like Victory Road and Seafoam Islands.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Located deep within the **Safari Zone** (typically Area 4/Secret House vicinity) in the Kanto region. It is found as an item ball on the ground.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind item linked to the NPC "Warden Slowpoke" (or Baidu in some localizations), known for his inability to communicate effectively until his dentures are restored.
* **World Knowledge:** While the JSON indicates Generation III, this is a legacy item from the original Kanto games (*Red/Blue/Yellow*). In the *Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!* remakes, the teeth are found on Route 19 rather than inside the Safari Zone, but the reward (access to the Strength mechanic) remains the same.
