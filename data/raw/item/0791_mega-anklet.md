## Identity & Utility
**Mega Anklet** is a Key Item/NPC Exclusive item introduced in **Generation VII** (though narratively linked to Generation VI).
* **Description:** An aesthetic variation of the Mega Ring, this anklet serves as a conduit for a Key Stone. It enables a Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone to undergo Mega Evolution. While it exists in the game data of the Alola-region titles, it is functionally an **NPC-exclusive** item that cannot be obtained or used by the player.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale/Unobtainable).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Trainer, it allows for the **Mega Evolution** of a Pokémon in battle, provided that Pokémon is holding its specific Mega Stone. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Because the item is unobtainable for players, it has no presence in VGC or Smogon competitive formats. It is strictly a narrative and mechanical tool for NPC battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Facilitates the temporary mid-battle transformation known as Mega Evolution. In the context of its owner, it is primarily used to Mega Evolve **Salamence** into **Mega Salamence**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** This item is coded into the games but is not accessible through any legitimate storefront or in-game event.
* **Lore & Context:** The Mega Anklet is the signature Key Stone accessory of **Zinnia**, the Lorekeeper of the Draconid people, featured during the *Delta Episode* in *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*. Its inclusion in the Generation VII (Sun/Moon) data is a remnant of NPC signaling, reflecting Zinnia's unique character design where she wears the Key Stone on her right ankle rather than a traditional Mega Ring or Z-Power Ring.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. It cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
