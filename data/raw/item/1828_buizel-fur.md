## Identity & Utility
**Buizel Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item represents fur shed by the Buizel evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. Its primary purpose is to serve as a component for creating Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found in Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, it is more efficiently utilized as a crafting reagent or exchanged for League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a specific ingredient in the crafting recipes for various TMs. Once consumed, the fur is removed from the player's inventory to "print" a move-teaching disc.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Competitive.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles. Its value is entirely restricted to the "pre-battle" preparation phase for move-set optimization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the **TM Machine** mechanic introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in regions where the Buizel line is native (primarily **Paldea**). It is not available in Poké Marts.
* **Wild Drops:** Automatically dropped after defeating or catching wild **Buizel** or **Floatzel**. 
* **Farming Context:** Players typically farm this item by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas with high water-type spawns, such as rivers, lakes, and coastlines (e.g., South Province Area One or West Province Area Two). It is a common material used for early-to-mid-game Water-type TMs like **TM011 (Water Pulse)** and **TM022 (Chilling Water)**.
