## Identity & Utility
**TM12 (Technical Machine 12)** is a **Machine** move-teaching item introduced in its modern form in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. While the move taught by TM12 has shifted throughout the series (Water Gun in Gen I, Sweet Scent in Gen II), it has been the permanent designated machine for **Taunt** since the Hoenn region. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** (depending on the generation) item that is widely available but often carries a premium price.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Very Expensive**). The high cost reflects its status as a high-tier tactical tool in the post-game or mid-to-late game shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Taunt** to a compatible Pokémon. Taunt is a Dark-type status move that prevents the target from using any non-damaging moves (status, heals, or setup) for three turns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** Taunt is one of the most important moves in competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). It is used to shut down "Stall" strategies, prevent opponents from setting up "Entry Hazards" (like Stealth Rock), and stop "Set-up Sweepers" from using moves like Swords Dance or Calm Mind.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, the move it teaches, Taunt, is specifically countered by the ability **Oblivious**, which makes a Pokémon immune to being Taunted.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, TM12 is found in high-end locations like the **Lilycove Department Store**, **Mauville City**, or given as a reward by NPCs (e.g., in the Slateport City or the Team Magma/Aqua Hideouts). In later generations, it is often purchasable at Pokémon Centers after reaching a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM12 is never found held by wild Pokémon; it must be found as a "Poké Ball" item on the ground or purchased from specialized vendors.
* **Legacy Note:** Historically, this TM taught **Water Gun** (Gen I) and **Sweet Scent** (Gen II), but it has remained the "Taunt" machine for over two decades of the franchise's history.
