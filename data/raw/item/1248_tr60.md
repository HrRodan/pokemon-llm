## Identity & Utility
**TR60 (X-Scissor)** is a **Machine (Technical Record)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon the move **X-Scissor**. The user slashes the target with crossed scythes or claws. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in this generation, Technical Records (TRs) are **consumable** and break after a single use.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**). While it has a credit value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **X-Scissor** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** X-Scissor is a Physical Bug-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It does not have any secondary effects, making it a reliable, high-accuracy STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) or coverage option.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Reliable Coverage.** In competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), X-Scissor is often passed over for *U-turn* (due to its pivoting utility) or *Leech Life* (for sustain). However, it remains a staple for physical attackers like **Scizor**, **Golisopod**, and **Pinsir** who require a consistent, high-damage Bug-type move without the drawbacks of contact-punishment or switching out.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Not an evolution item. It is a one-time instruction tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR60 can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts (typically 3,000 W to 5,000 W). It is also frequently dropped as a reward for defeating Bug-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured technological resource. It is primarily farmed by completing Max Raid dens or participating in the Rotom Rally.
