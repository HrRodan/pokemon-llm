## Identity & Utility
**TR39 (Superpower)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword/Shield)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use machine used to teach the move **Superpower** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike the Infinite-use TMs of the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use, mirroring the mechanics of early-generation Technical Machines.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it carries a high monetary value, it is more commonly acquired via Watt Traders for 8,000 Watts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Superpower**. Superpower is a Physical Fighting-type move with 120 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. Upon use, it lowers the user's Attack and Defense stats by one stage each.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120 (Maximum Tier). This is one of the highest possible Fling damage values, though using it this way destroys the item without teaching the move.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Coverage.** Superpower is a staple in competitive formats (Smogon and VGC) for physical attackers needing a high-burst Fighting-type move. It is particularly devastating on Pokémon with the **Contrary** ability (like Malamar), where the stat drops are inverted into Attack and Defense boosts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is often paired with a **White Herb** held item to negate the stat drops after the first use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily in the Galar region's Wild Area. It is sold by **Watt Traders** (inventory rotates daily) and is a common reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Fighting-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. This item is exclusively distributed through Galar's raid economy and specialized vendors, representing "lost" or "advanced" move data that requires significant effort (Watts or Raids) to obtain.
