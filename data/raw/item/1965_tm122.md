## Identity & Utility
**TM122 (Encore)** is a **Machine** item introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches the move **Encore** to compatible Pokémon. In the context of the Paldea region, it is a single-use consumable that can be manufactured at any TM Machine. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that **Cannot be bought** with standard currency; instead, it is acquired through exploration or crafting.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Its value is measured in League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials rather than traditional currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Encore**. When used in battle, Encore forces the target to repeat its last used move for three consecutive turns. This effectively prevents the target from selecting different moves, including defensive options or alternate attacks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Encore is a premier disruption move in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is used to "lock" opponents into non-damaging moves (like Protect, Stealth Rock, or Dragon Dance), forcing them to switch out or become "setup fodder." It is highly effective on fast Pokémon or those with the **Prankster** ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the Gen IX **TM Machine** system. Crafting TM122 requires 3,000 LP, 3 Hawlucha Nails, and 3 Slakoth Fur.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed throughout the Paldea region as a golden Poké Ball item drop. Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked for the player to craft indefinitely provided they have the necessary materials. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it must be gathered from wild **Hawlucha** and **Slakoth** (often farmed efficiently using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature).
* **Historical Context:** While TM122 is "Encore" in Scarlet/Violet, the TM numbering system shifted significantly in Generation IX; in previous generations, Encore was taught via different TM numbers (e.g., TM03 in Gen VIII) or was an Egg Move/Move Tutor exclusive.
