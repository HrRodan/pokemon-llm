## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA5054** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item designed to trigger a Max Raid Battle at a specific location. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to spawn. It is a single-use consumable that remains active only until the end of the day in which it was used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically categorized as **Cheap**, but practically **Not for sale**; these are distributed exclusively via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty Pokémon Den in the Wild Area), this crystal activates a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the "UMA5054" designation is associated with promotional distributions that typically summon a **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a standard Pokémon battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that may have its Hidden Ability or the Gigantamax factor, both of which are critical for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.
