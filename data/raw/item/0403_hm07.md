## Identity & Utility
**HM07 (Waterfall)** is an **All-Machines** (Hidden Machine) item introduced in **Generation II** (and consistently appearing as HM07 in Generations III and IV).
* **Description:** This item teaches the move **Waterfall** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in earlier generations, Hidden Machines are not consumed upon use and can be used indefinitely. It is a **Key Item** utility that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Waterfall** (Water-type, Physical). 
    * **In-Battle:** Deals damage with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a **20% chance to flinch** the target.
    * **Overworld:** While the player is surfing, it allows them to travel vertically up and down waterfalls, a mechanic essential for reaching late-game areas like the Pokémon League in Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (HMs cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Competitive Staple).** Waterfall is the primary Physical Water-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for many competitive Pokémon, such as **Gyarados, Azumarill, and Feraligatr**, due to its reliability and flinch potential.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Requires specific Gym Badges (e.g., the Rain Badge in Hoenn or the Beacon Badge in Sinnoh) to be used outside of battle. In modern generations (Gen VII onwards), HMs have been largely replaced by Poke Ride or secret techniques, but HM07 remains iconic to the "HM Slave" or utility-mon meta of classic games.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually gifted to the player by an NPC or found in a late-game dungeon. 
    * **Johto:** Found in the **Ice Path**.
    * **Hoenn:** Found in the **Cave of Origin** or **Sootopolis City**.
    * **Sinnoh:** Received from **Jasmine** in Sunyshore City after defeating the 8th Gym Leader.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique story-progression item that is essential for completing the main campaign and navigating to the Elite Four.
