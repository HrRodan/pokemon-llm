## Identity & Utility
**Snorlax-candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with energy. It is designed to be fed to specific Pokémon to provide a comprehensive power boost. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally earned through gameplay rather than bought in standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its value lies in its rarity and acquisition method rather than its sell price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Snorlax** or its pre-evolution **Munchlax**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed) by 1 point simultaneously. These bonuses are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, which replaced the traditional Effort Value (EV) system in the *Let's Go* titles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is a staple for "maxing out" a Snorlax within the *Let's Go* ecosystem. It is significantly more efficient than using individual stat candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy) because it raises every stat at once. It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats which utilize the traditional EV/IV system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is the highest tier of stat-boosting items for the Snorlax line, usable regardless of the Pokémon's level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in standard Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired by catching wild Snorlax, transferring multiple Snorlax to Professor Oak, or playing minigames in the GO Park Complex.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer for capturing Snorlax or via the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral when taking a Snorlax for a "stroll." In the context of the *Let's Go* series, it represents the condensed "essence" or specialized nutrition for the Snorlax species.
