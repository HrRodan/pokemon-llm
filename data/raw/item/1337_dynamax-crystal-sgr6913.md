## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR6913** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is an event-exclusive consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss until midnight of the same day. While categorized as a "Dynamax Crystal," it functions similarly to a Key Item or a "Lure" for high-tier raids.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal placeholder cost; typically not obtainable through standard commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to initiate a Max Raid Battle. This specific crystal (SGR6913) was part of a distribution event to facilitate an encounter with a **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None Directly.** The item is a utility tool for the overworld. However, it is competitively significant as it provides a guaranteed method to obtain a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, high individual values (IVs), and potentially its Hidden Ability, which are essential for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the Max Raid Den mechanics of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-only item**. It was primarily distributed via serial codes (such as those found in the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield: Official Galar Region Strategy Guide* or specific retail promotions). It is not available for purchase at Poke Marts or found through standard gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to external distribution methods.
