## Identity & Utility
**Abra Candy** is a **Species-Specific Stat Booster** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with concentrated energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought for a nominal fee, though it is primarily earned through gameplay mechanics. It is designed to be fed specifically to members of the Abra evolutionary line.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by an **Abra, Kadabra, or Alakazam**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 Awakening Value (AV)**. This bypasses the traditional effort value (EV) system used in other generations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** While vital for optimizing an Alakazam for the "Master Trainer" battles or competitive play within the *Let's Go* ecosystem, this item does not exist and has no effect in standard core-series VGC or Smogon formats (which use EVs and Vitamins).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is the most efficient way to reach the maximum cap of 200 AVs in every stat for the Abra line, making a level 100 Alakazam significantly more powerful than its standard-series counterpart.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Can be purchased from the **Pokémon Center** after certain milestones in the *Let's Go* games, but the most common method of acquisition is through the **Catch Combo** mechanic (catching multiple Abra in a row) or by **transferring** captured Abra, Kadabra, or Alakazam to Professor Oak.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the "Capture Research" conducted by the player. It represents the "essence" or "energy" of the specific species gathered during the catching process.
