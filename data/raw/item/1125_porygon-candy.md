## Identity & Utility
**Porygon Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy tailored to the Porygon evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be held in battle and is typically used within the bag menu to enhance a Pokémon's power.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the purchase price is low, these are rarely bought and are instead primarily earned through gameplay loops involving the specific species.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the **Porygon, Porygon2, or Porygon-Z** evolutionary family, it increases **all six stats simultaneously** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. In the *Let's Go* mechanics, these points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, which are distinct from traditional Effort Values (EVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is only relevant within the *Let's Go* ecosystem. In that context, it is the most efficient way to "max out" a Porygon for Master Trainer battles or competitive matches where AVs are permitted. It bypasses the level requirements and caps associated with generic candies (like Quick Candy or Mighty Candy).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It interacts with the **Porygon line only**; attempting to use it on other species will have no effect.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Porygon Candy is primarily acquired through three methods:
    1. **Catching Wild Porygon:** Catching multiple Porygon in a row (Catch Combo) increases the chance of receiving species-specific candy.
    2. **Transferring to Professor Oak:** Sending captured Porygon to the Professor yields these candies as a reward for research.
    3. **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking a Porygon in the Poké Ball Plus peripheral can generate candy over time.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon as a held item. It is a reward for the "Catch and Research" loop central to the Kanto reimagining.
* **Context:** As Porygon is a man-made, "Virtual Pokémon," the candy represents the digital and physical data optimization required to enhance its performance beyond its factory settings.
