## Identity & Utility
**Rolycoly Coal** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A dropped material obtained from the Rolycoly evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting reagent used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific TMs. It is a **Consumable Resource** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or converted into League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource Tier).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines. It has no direct effect in battle or on a Pokémon's stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly restricted to the **Team Building** phase, allowing players to teach high-tier moves to their roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone or a trigger for baby Pokémon. It is exclusively part of the **Paldean Crafting System**. It is used to craft several TMs, most notably:
    * **TM076 (Rock Blast)**
    * **TM086 (Rock Slide)**
    * **TM165 (Flare Blitz)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Rolycoly**, **Carkol**, or **Coalossal**. These Pokémon are commonly found in the rocky terrains, mines, and caves of the **Paldea region**, such as the East Province (Area Three) and Dalizapa Passage.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item in the traditional sense, it is guaranteed or highly likely to drop from the **Rolycoly line** upon a successful encounter. It can also be obtained via the **Auto-Battle (Let's Go!)** mechanic, making it easily farmable for competitive move-set optimization.
