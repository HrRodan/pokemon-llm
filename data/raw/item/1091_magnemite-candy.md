## Identity & Utility
**Magnemite Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with concentrated energy. When administered to a compatible Pokémon, it boosts all of its stats simultaneously. Unlike generic candies, this item is restricted to the Magnemite evolutionary line.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Magnemite**, **Magneton**, or **Magnezone**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. In the context of *Let's Go*, this contributes to the Pokémon's **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily utilized for "Master Trainer" battles and post-game challenges within the *Let's Go* ecosystem. It is **non-functional** in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as these formats utilize traditional Effort Values (EVs) rather than the AV system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancing consumable. It cannot be used on any Pokémon outside of the Magnemite evolutionary line.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the *Let's Go* series, these candies are primarily acquired by catching multiple Magnemite in succession (Catch Combos) or by transferring Magnemite to Professor Oak. They are also rarely awarded by walking a Magnemite in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** held by wild Pokémon. It is a reward-based item earned through gameplay mechanics rather than found via traditional farming or the **Pickup** ability.
