## Identity & Utility
**Amulet Coin** is a **Training Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that serves as a financial multiplier. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought for a high price, though it is typically acquired as a unique gift or found in specific world locations.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high sell/buy value, it is rarely sold in standard Marts and is treated as a high-value utility tool.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the Pokémon holding the Amulet Coin enters a trainer battle (even briefly), the prize money received at the end of the battle is **doubled**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Participation Requirement:** The holder must actively participate in the battle (be sent out onto the field). 
    * **Persistence:** The effect triggers even if the holder faints during the battle, provided they were sent out at least once.
    * **Stacking:** This effect **does not stack** with other Amulet Coins or the Luck Incense.
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Prize money is irrelevant in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon; this item is strictly for playthrough progression, Nuzlocke resource management, and post-game "money farming."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in specific locations (e.g., the Smithy in Galar or as a gift from the protagonist's Mother in Hoenn/Sinnoh after achieving certain milestones). It is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon** in the provided data, making it a rare and vital find for players looking to afford expensive TMs, Vitamins, or specialty Poké Balls.
* **Lore Context:** It is the primary "Economy" item of the Pokémon world, often paired with the **Happy Hour** move or **G-Max Gold Rush** to maximize financial gains during Elite Four runs.
