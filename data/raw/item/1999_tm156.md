## Identity & Utility
**TM156** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
*   **Description:** This machine teaches the move **Psychic Noise** to compatible Pokémon. As a TM from the Generation IX era, it is a single-use consumable that can be replicated using a TM Machine if the player has the necessary League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials. 
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Poke Marts; requires crafting via the TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Noise**. 
    *   **Move Type:** Psychic (Special).
    *   **Power/Accuracy:** 75 Power / 100% Accuracy.
    *   **Secondary Effect:** For two turns, the target is prevented from recovering HP by any means (including moves like Recover, Roost, or items like Leftovers). This effectively applies the "Heal Block" status while dealing damage.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** Psychic Noise is a significant anti-meta tool in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is used to shut down defensive "stall" archetypes and bulky Pokémon that rely on reliable recovery (e.g., Dondozo, Toxapex, or Blissey).
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be crafted multiple times once the recipe is unlocked.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Terarium** of the Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk DLC). It is typically found as a collectible item on the ground in the Biomes or rewarded after specific trainer challenges.
*   **Crafting Requirements:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, crafting TM156 requires:
    *   **8,000 LP**
    *   **Porygon-Z Materials** (3x Porygon Prism)
    *   **Hatterene Materials** (3x Hatenna Dust)
    *   **Slowbro Materials** (3x Slowpoke Claw)
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial data disc created for training.
