## Identity & Utility
**Quiet Mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** When used on a Pokémon, it alters its stat growth patterns to match the **Quiet** Nature. Specifically, it encourages Special Attack growth while hindering Speed growth. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is primarily used as a post-game optimization tool.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically categorized as **Cheap/Accessible** in the data, though in practice, it is typically purchased with high-value currency like 50 Battle Points (BP) or 20,000 Poké Dollars at specialized shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the Pokémon's stat multipliers. The Pokémon's **Special Attack** will increase by 10%, and its **Speed** will decrease by 10%. 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon's actual Nature (e.g., "Jolly") remains listed in the summary, but the stat highlights (Blue/Red indicators) and growth calculations will reflect the **Quiet** profile.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; generally not used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility.** The Quiet Mint is a staple for optimizing **Special Attackers** intended for **Trick Room** teams, where a lower Speed stat is advantageous to ensure the Pokémon moves first under the distorted dimensions. It is also vital for making Shiny Pokémon or legendary encounters competitively viable without the need for breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Quality of Life" item that bypasses the need for traditional Nature breeding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Battle Tower** shops (Gen VIII) or **Chansey Supply** outlets (Gen IX). It can also be found as a rare reward from high-level Max Raid Battles or Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its acquisition is strictly tied to specialized trainers, competitive facilities, or rare overworld spawns in endgame zones (like the Area Zero or the Crown Tundra).
