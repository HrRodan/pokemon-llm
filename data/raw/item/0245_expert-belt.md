## Identity & Utility
**Expert Belt** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A well-worn belt intended to be held by a Pokémon. It provides a strategic offensive boost by amplifying the damage of moves that capitalize on type advantages. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that is typically not found in standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate value; usually a unique find or earned through BP/special NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a move that is **Super Effective** against the target, the power of that move is increased by **20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects upon flinging).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-tier niche item often used on versatile attackers with wide type coverage (e.g., Greninja, Lucario, or Nidoking). It is frequently used to **"bluff"** a Choice item; since it lacks the recoil of a Life Orb, an opponent may incorrectly assume the user is locked into a specific move. While the 20% boost is lower than a Life Orb (30%), the lack of HP drain makes it superior for defensive longevity.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its effect is strictly offensive and relies on the user's ability to hit for super-effective damage; it provides no benefit if the move deals neutral or resisted damage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, it is obtained via specific NPC rewards (such as showing a Pokémon of a certain level to the man in Celestic Town) or purchased via Battle Points (BP) in post-game facilities like the Battle Frontier or Battle Maison.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is rare in the wild but is occasionally held by wild **Throh** and **Sawk**. Trainers looking to farm this item should utilize Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and moves like **Thief** or **Covet**.
