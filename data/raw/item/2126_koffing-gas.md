## Identity & Utility
**Koffing Gas** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting component representing a biological sample or byproduct from the Koffing evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts but has a nominal sell value.
* **Cost:** 25 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Basic Material**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item is used exclusively at the **Technical Machine Machine (TMM)** found at Pokémon Centers. It serves as a required ingredient to craft specific TMs, typically those associated with Poison-type moves or explosive capabilities (e.g., **TM102 Gunk Shot**, **TM148 Sludge Bomb**, or **TM018 Thief**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no direct impact on battle stats or mechanics. Its value is entirely infrastructural, allowing players to teach competitive moves to their Pokémon during team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is not affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it is a material drop rather than a standard held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquisition is limited to the **Technical Machine Machine** ecosystem. It is primarily earned as a reward for defeating or catching wild members of the Koffing line. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a **guaranteed drop** (1-3 units) when a player defeats or captures a wild **Koffing** or **Weezing** in the Paldea region or the Terarium. Unlike items gathered via the Pickup ability, these materials are tied specifically to the species defeated.
