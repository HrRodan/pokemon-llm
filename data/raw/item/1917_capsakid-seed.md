## Identity & Utility
**Capsakid Seed** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized material dropped by members of the Capsakid evolutionary line. It is a consumable crafting ingredient used primarily at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a non-holdable item that serves as a resource rather than a tool for direct battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In the Paldean economy, these are frequently exchanged for League Points (LP) or used in crafting recipes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Once used in a recipe at the TMM, the seeds are consumed. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the crafting and progression mechanics of the overworld and does not impact competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it is a "seed," it does not function like a Sun Stone or Leaf Stone and cannot trigger the evolution of Capsakid into Scovillain (which requires a Fire Stone). Its primary interaction is limited to the TM crafting subsystem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Capsakid** or **Scovillain** in the Paldea region. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not traditionally "held" by the Pokémon but is instead added to the player's "TM Materials" bag pocket upon successful encounter resolution. It is most efficiently gathered by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where Capsakid are indigenous, such as the West Province.
* **Crafting Context:** It is a core component for Grass-type and Fire-type TMs, reflecting Capsakid's unique dual-type potential (Grass/Fire) upon evolution. Common TMs requiring this material include **TM159 (Leaf Storm)** and **TM168 (Solar Beam)**.
