## Identity & Utility
**TM135 (Ice Beam)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach the move **Ice Beam** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike previous generations where TMs were often single-use or infinite-use depending on the era, in Generation IX, this is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly at any TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or by using the Technical Machine Machine crafting system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Ice Beam**. Ice Beam is a high-accuracy, high-power Special Ice-type move (Power: 90, Accuracy: 100%) with a 10% chance to freeze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Ice Beam is one of the most consistent and valuable Special moves in the history of competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). It provides essential offensive coverage against Dragon, Flying, Ground, and Grass types. It is a mandatory inclusion for many Special Attackers like Kyogre, Iron Bundle, and various Water-type "bulky waters."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be reconstructed if the player has the necessary materials.
