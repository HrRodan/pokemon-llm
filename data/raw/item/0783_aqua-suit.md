## Identity & Utility
**Aqua-suit** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII** (primarily associated with the Hoenn remakes, Pokémon Alpha Sapphire).
* **Description:** A specialized high-tech diving suit developed using the collective technological expertise of Team Aqua. It is designed to withstand extreme pressure and impacts. As a **Key Item**, it is neither consumable nor holdable by Pokémon, and it cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides the player with the necessary protection to ride **Kyogre** into the depths of the **Cave of Origin**. It serves as a narrative gatekeeper, allowing the protagonist to survive the environmental hazards associated with the Primal Reversion of the Legendary Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item exists solely for story progression and overworld interaction; it has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is specifically tied to the player's interaction with **Kyogre**. Unlike the Magma Suit (its counterpart in Omega Ruby), this item is exclusive to the narrative path involving Team Aqua.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a gift during the climax of the main story in **Pokémon Alpha Sapphire**. It is given to the player by **Archie**, the leader of Team Aqua, to facilitate the confrontation with Primal Kyogre.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological marvel within the Pokémon world lore.
