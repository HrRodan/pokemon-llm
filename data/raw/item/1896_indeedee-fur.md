## Identity & Utility
**Indeedee Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of soft, high-quality fur dropped by Indeedee. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various moves. While it can be sold, its primary utility is in move-teaching preparation.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**; primarily used as a trade-in for League Points (LP) or as a crafting component).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft TMs in the Paldea region. It has no direct effect when used from the bag or on a Pokémon in the overworld.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for team building and move-set optimization rather than a tactical item used during active combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly part of the Generation IX crafting ecosystem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Indeedee** (both Male and Female forms). It is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Indeedee**. Due to Indeedee’s presence in specific habitats like the North Province (Area One), it is a farmable resource for players looking to craft support-oriented or psychic-type TMs.
* **Crafting Context:** Indeedee Fur is a key component for crafting high-value TMs, most notably **TM092 (Imprison)**, **TM098 (Skill Swap)**, and **TM129 (Calm Mind)**, reflecting Indeedee's lore as a supportive, utility-heavy species.
