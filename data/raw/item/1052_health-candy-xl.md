## Identity & Utility
**Health Candy XL** is a **Vitamin** (Stat-Enhancer) introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A high-tier, specialized candy packed with energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used to permanently boost a Pokémon's HP stat. Unlike standard Vitamins (like HP Up), this item is level-restricted and is designed for late-game optimization. It **cannot** be purchased at standard Poké Marts in its debut games.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Low Resale Value**). Its value lies in its utility rather than its market price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon's **HP Awakening Value (AV)** by 1 point. In the *Let's Go* series mechanics, AVs allow a Pokémon to increase its stats far beyond traditional Effort Value (EV) limits, with a maximum of 200 bonus points per stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held item mechanics are absent or modified in the games where this item exists).
    * **Level Requirement:** This item can only be administered to Pokémon that are **Level 60 or higher**, marking it as an end-game optimization tool.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential for Let's Go Competitive Formats.** Because AVs drastically inflate stats, a Pokémon must have maxed AVs (including HP) to be viable in unrestricted competitive play within the *Let's Go* ecosystem.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is functionally similar to "Health Candy" and "Health Candy L," but represents the highest tier of the HP candy hierarchy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through gameplay loops rather than shops. It is rewarded to the player for:
    * Sending Pokémon of a specific species to **Professor Oak**.
    * Achieving high **Catch Combos** (chaining) of HP-heavy Pokémon (e.g., Chansey, Snorlax).
    * Rewards from the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Instead, it is "farmed" by catching large quantities of wild Pokémon to receive rewards from the Professor, reflecting a shift toward "collection" mechanics over traditional "thieving" or "pickup" mechanics.
