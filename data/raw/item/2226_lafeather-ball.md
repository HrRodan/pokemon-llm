## Identity & Utility
**Feather Ball** (lafeather-ball) is a specialized **Poké Ball** introduced in the Hisui region (**Generation VIII: Pokémon Legends: Arceus**).
* **Description:** A lightweight, aerodynamic Poké Ball designed to be thrown much further and faster than a standard Poké Ball. It travels in a straighter trajectory, making it the primary tool for snaring elusive or distant targets. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily **Crafted** or purchased within the Hisui region.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale in modern markets; requires Hisuian crafting materials or specific Jubilife Village currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides a high-velocity throw with a long-range trajectory. It is specifically optimized for catching Pokémon that "fly high in the air," granting a significantly higher catch rate multiplier when used against aerial spawns or Pokémon positioned at a distance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic is not present in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists exclusively within the single-player mechanics of the Hisui region and cannot be used in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as held items and traditional catching mechanics differ in the Hisui era.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is the first tier of the "high-flyer" ball hierarchy, followed by the **Wing Ball** and the **Jet Ball**. It interacts with the player's aiming reticle, allowing for "sniping" Pokémon from outside their detection range.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained via **Crafting** (Recipe: 1 Apricorn + 1 Sky Tumblestone) or purchased from the General Store and Base Camp merchants in the Hisui region after reaching the appropriate Research Rank.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In the Hisui region, items are typically gathered from the environment (ore deposits/trees) rather than through the modern **Pickup** ability or held-item mechanics.
* **Context:** The Feather Ball represents the technological shift in Hisui where specialized materials like **Sky Tumblestones** were used to manipulate the physical properties (weight and aerodynamics) of Poké Balls before the standardization of the modern era.
