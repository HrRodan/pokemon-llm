## Identity & Utility
**Big Root** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A large, sturdy root to be held by a Pokémon. It amplifies the effectiveness of HP-recovery moves, allowing the holder to gain more health from "drain" mechanics. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be bought for a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**; usually found in specialty shops or late-game marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the amount of HP recovered by **30%** when using specific health-draining moves or status effects. This applies to:
    * **Draining Moves:** *Absorb, Drain Punch, Dream Eater, Giga Drain, Leech Life, Mega Drain, Oblivion Wing, Parabolic Charge,* and *Horn Leech*.
    * **Status/Field Effects:** *Aqua Ring, Ingrain,* and *Leech Seed*.
    * **Note:** Crucially, this item **does not increase damage dealt**; it only modifies the recovery ratio of the damage inflicted.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Specialized.** While generally outclassed by *Leftovers* for consistent recovery, the Big Root is a tactical choice for "Drain-Tank" builds. It is most effective on Pokémon that rely on *Leech Seed* or *Strength Sap* to stall out opponents, or on heavy hitters with *Drain Punch* (like Conkeldurr or Iron Hands) when maximum sustain is required over raw power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the recovery math of the holder's moveset; it does not bypass the effects of *Heal Block*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available in major Department Stores or via the Battle Frontier/Battle Subway for BP. In many regions, it is found tucked away in forest or swamp environments.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Lileep** and **Cradily** (5% chance). Trainers looking to farm this item should use a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or rely on the **Pickup** ability at higher levels.
