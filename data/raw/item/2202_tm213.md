## Identity & Utility
**TM213 (Temper Flare)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that imparts the move **Temper Flare** to compatible Pokémon. As a modern TM, it is single-use for teaching but can be replicated via the TM Machine once discovered. It is a **Consumable/Machine** item that cannot be purchased for standard currency but is crafted using League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Requires LP and Pokémon Materials for crafting; not for sale in standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Temper Flare**. This is a Physical Fire-type move with a base power of 75 and 100% accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Move Logic:** Temper Flare features a unique punishing mechanic: if the user’s previous move failed (due to the target's **Protect**, a miss, or type immunity), Temper Flare’s power **doubles to 150**.
    * **Competitive Use:** It serves as a strong "anti-meta" coverage move. It is particularly effective on physical attackers to punish opponents who rely on *Protect* or *Detect* to stall turns, making it a niche but powerful choice in VGC (Doubles) and high-level Singles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a data-disc item used solely for move tutoring.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy) during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. It is typically found as a TM capsule in the Savanna or Canyon Biomes or rewarded by the BB League.
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once found, it can be crafted at any TM Machine using:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Chimchar Fur**
    * **3x Tepig Sweat**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; exclusively obtained through exploration or crafting in the Paldea/Blueberry region.
