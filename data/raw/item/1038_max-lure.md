## Identity & Utility
**Max Lure** is a **Spelunking/Adventure Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A glass bottle of potent perfume that, when sprayed, increases the encounter rate of rare Pokémon in the overworld. It serves as the final tier in the Lure hierarchy (Lure < Super Lure < Max Lure). It is a consumable item that can be purchased in bulk.
* **Cost:** 900 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Premium consumable; more efficient per step than its lower-tier counterparts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the spawn rate of rare Pokémon and increases the likelihood of encountering Pokémon with higher IVs or Shiny variations (when paired with Catch Combos). In the *Let's Go* series, it lasts for **250 steps**, the longest duration of any Lure-type item.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. This item has no utility in standard competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it is strictly an overworld adventure tool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a staple for **"Shiny Hunters"** and **"Competitive Catchers."** By increasing the density of spawns, it allows players to build "Catch Combos" faster, which indirectly leads to finding Pokémon with "Amazing Stats" (4-6 Perfect IVs) for competitive use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at Poké Marts across the Kanto region in the *Let's Go* titles, typically becoming available after the player has earned at least 7 or 8 Gym Badges. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Repels, which keep Pokémon away, the Max Lure is lore-distinguished as a "perfume" that actively attracts them, marking a mechanical shift in how players interact with wild spawns in the transition to overworld-visible Pokémon.
