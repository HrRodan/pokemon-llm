## Identity & Utility
**Armor Fossil** is a **Dex-completion / Fossil Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A fossilized remains of a prehistoric land-dwelling Pokémon, characterized by what appears to be a protective collar. It is a **Consumable (Single-use)** item that, while having a defined price, is typically acquired through specialized mechanics like mining rather than standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it can be sold for a high price, its primary value is in the Pokémon it produces.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specific revival laboratory—such as the **Oreburgh Mining Museum** in Sinnoh or the **Museum of Science** in Pewter City—this item is consumed to resurrect the Rock/Steel-type Pokémon **Shieldon** at Level 5 (Gen IV) or Level 20 (Gen VI).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High damage). While it lacks a secondary Fling effect, its high base power makes it a surprisingly heavy projectile, though using it this way permanently loses the fossil.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Developmental.** The item itself has no competitive benefit during battle. However, it is the only way to obtain **Shieldon** and its evolution **Bastiodon**, which serves as a dedicated defensive wall and "Sturdy" lead in lower competitive tiers (like PU or NU).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the counterpart to the **Skull Fossil** (Cranidos). It represents the defensive half of the Generation IV fossil duo.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically a **Version Exclusive** item. It is most commonly found in *Pokémon Pearl*, *Shining Pearl*, and *Alpha Sapphire*. 
* **Acquisition Method:** Primarily obtained through the **Sinnoh Underground** (Mining Minigame) or by smashing rocks in specific regions (e.g., Mirage Spots in Hoenn). It is not held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **World Knowledge:** The Armor Fossil is themed after the *Protoceratops* or similar ceratopsian dinosaurs, reflecting Shieldon’s shield-like face. In the Sinnoh region's lore, it is considered the defensive mirror to the aggressive Skull Fossil.
