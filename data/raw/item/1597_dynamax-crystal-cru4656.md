## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Cru4656)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event/Special Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair within the Galar Wild Area. When used, it activates a Max Raid Battle, causing a specific Pokémon to appear in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Low Placeholder Cost**; typically obtained via promotional codes or special distributions rather than being bought or sold).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the North Lake Miloch area), the crystal is consumed to force a specific **Max Raid Battle** encounter. This encounter usually features a rare Pokémon, often with its Hidden Ability or the Gigantamax factor.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** as a held item. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing access to Pokémon with specific **Individual Values (IVs)**, **Hidden Abilities**, or **Gigantamax forms** that are otherwise difficult to encounter.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used as a "den trigger" for the Max Raid Battle mechanic unique to the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are **Event-Exclusive**. They were primarily distributed via serial codes through retailers (such as GameStop or Pokémon Center) or as bonuses for purchasing the Sword and Shield Expansion Pass or specific guidebooks. The "Cru" prefix identifies it as a specific encounter code (historically associated with promotional encounters like Centiskorch, Sandaconda, or Copperajah).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a digital distribution item.
