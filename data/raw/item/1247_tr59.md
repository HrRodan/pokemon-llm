## Identity & Utility
**TR59 (Seed Bomb)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach the move **Seed Bomb** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are **consumable medicines/items** that break after a single use. It is a one-time-use instruction manual for a physical Grass-type attack.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars/Watts (**Moderate price**; typically exchanged for Watts at Watt Traders in the Galar Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Seed Bomb** (Grass-type, Physical, 80 Power, 100% Accuracy). The move involves slamming hard-shelled seeds onto the target from above and makes no contact.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Substantial damage when used with the move Fling, though the TR is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** Seed Bomb is a reliable, medium-power Grass-type coverage move. It is a **staple for physical attackers** (such as Rillaboom, Ferrothorn, or Breloom) that require a Grass-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move without the recoil of Wood Hammer or the lower accuracy/utility of other options.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon successful teaching. It cannot be used if the Pokémon is already familiar with the move or is incompatible.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR59 is primarily acquired by defeating Grass-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts. Its availability rotates daily among different traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically a reward for high-level raid encounters, reflecting the "hard-shelled" nature of the seeds described in the flavor text.
