## Identity & Utility
**Komala-Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Drowsing Pokémon, Komala. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon to provide a passive boost. It is primarily used at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It can also be sold for League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine. Specifically, it is a required component for crafting **TM060 (U-turn)**, a high-value pivot move in competitive play.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, its role in crafting **U-turn** makes it indirectly vital for competitive team building. U-turn is a staple move for momentum-based strategies in both VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting reagent. It is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Komala**. It is not sold in Poké Marts or Delibird Presents; it must be farmed through wild encounters or Tera Raid Battles featuring Komala.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense for the player, it is an intrinsic drop from the **Komala** evolutionary line. In the Paldea region, players typically farm this material in areas with lush vegetation or forests where Komala is known to dwell (e.g., East Province Area One or Two).
* **Crafting Context:** To craft one copy of TM060 (U-turn), a player typically requires **3 Komala Claws** along with 3,000 LP and other materials (like Mankey Fur).
