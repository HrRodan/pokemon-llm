## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CMA2618)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. It functions as a single-use "key" to spawn a specific Pokémon raid.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a internal price value, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is considered a promotional/special acquisition item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair (an empty raid den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, a pillar of red light appears. This initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon associated with the "CMA2618" designation (traditionally used for special distribution events like the G-Max Centiskorch or dual-pack pre-order bonuses).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is entirely restricted to the overworld for the purpose of initiating raids to catch Pokémon or farm TRs (Technical Records) and Dynamax Candies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is the primary method for encountering specific Gigantamax or rare Pokémon early in a playthrough depending on the specific event code used.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** or special promotional events (such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Expansion Pass or physical retail bonuses). It cannot be obtained through natural gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant for the player's inventory.
* **Location Context:** It is uniquely tied to the **Watchtower Ruins** in the Galar Wild Area; the item is inert and cannot be activated at any other raid den in the region.
