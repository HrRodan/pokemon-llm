## Identity & Utility
**Choice Band** is a **Competitive Held Item** (Choice-category) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** This curious headband is a specialized combat tool designed to dramatically enhance physical power at the cost of tactical flexibility. It is a **Holdable** item that is typically not found in standard Poké Marts, but rather through high-level battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Specialized Acquisition**). While it has a monetary value, it is historically obtained via Battle Points (BP) or in endgame locations.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon's **Attack stat is increased by 1.5x (50%)**. However, the holder is "locked" into the first move it selects. All other moves become disabled until the Pokémon is switched out of battle or the item is removed/suppressed. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low). Flinging this item is generally disadvantageous as it yields minimal damage and loses the Attack boost.
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** The Choice Band is a cornerstone of competitive play (Smogon/VGC). It is primarily used by "Wallbreakers"—Pokémon with high natural Attack—to secure OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) that would otherwise be impossible. It is frequently paired with pivoting moves like **U-turn** or **Flip Turn** to reset the move-lock while maintaining momentum.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * The move-lock restriction resets even if the item is swapped for another "Choice" item (Choice Specs or Choice Scarf) via moves like **Trick** or **Switcheroo**. 
    * If a Pokémon's ability is **Gorilla Tactics**, the effects stack, resulting in massive physical damage. Conversely, the ability **Klutz** prevents the holder from gaining the boost or being move-locked.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Rarely available in standard shops. It is most commonly found as a prize in endgame facilities such as the **Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, Battle Maison, or Battle Tower**. In some regions, it can be found as a one-time pickup in high-level routes or hidden areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon, making it a "Special Acquisition" item that must be earned through trainer excellence or specific exploration.
