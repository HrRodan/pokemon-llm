## Identity & Utility
**TM181 (Knock Off)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A single-use device (in Gen IX) used to teach the move **Knock Off** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike older generations where TMs were either permanent or simple shop items, this machine is part of the Gen IX crafting ecosystem.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, this item is acquired through exploration or crafted at a **TM Machine** using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Knock Off**. 
    * **Type:** Dark / **Category:** Physical / **Power:** 65 / **Accuracy:** 100%.
    * **Move Logic:** The user slaps down the target's held item, preventing its use. If the target is holding a removable item, the move's damage is increased by 50% (to approximately 97.5 base power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Top-Tier Staple.** Knock Off is widely considered one of the best moves in competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). It provides immense utility by removing critical items like Leftovers, Choice Scarfs, or Heavy-Duty Boots, while simultaneously dealing significant damage. It is a "low-risk, high-reward" move that forces switches and disrupts strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is a highly sought-after move for physical attackers and utility "walls" to cripple opponents.

## Acquisition & Lore

    * **Crafting:** Can be created at any TM Machine for **5,000 LP**, **Pawniard Blade x3**, **Alomomola Mucus x3**, and **Tinkatink Hair x3**.
    * **Location:** Found as a physical item in the **Terarium (Blueberry Academy)** during the events of *The Indigo Disk* DLC.
