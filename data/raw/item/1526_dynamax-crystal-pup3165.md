## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (pup3165)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal Internal Value**; primarily distributed via promotional serial codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area (Galar), it causes a specific Pokémon—traditionally a **Larvitar** (via the *★And15* encounter)—to appear as a Dynamax Raid boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day or until the boss is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a Raid Battle to catch a Pokémon that may have high IVs or a Hidden Ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid. It does not evolve Pokémon but facilitates the acquisition of version-exclusive or rare species in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase in-game. This specific crystal was part of a **promotional distribution**, specifically provided via serial codes included in the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack* (and subsequent regional pre-order bonuses). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly digital event distribution item.
