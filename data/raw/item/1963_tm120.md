## Identity & Utility
**TM120 (Psychic)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the move **Psychic**. In the Paldea region, TMs are single-use consumable items, but they can be crafted repeatedly at any TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **10,000 LP** and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Psychic is a Special Psychic-type move with **90 Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Psychic is the gold standard for Psychic-type Special offense. It is a mandatory inclusion for many Special Attackers (like Gardevoir, Hatterene, or Iron Valiant) for consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage or as high-value coverage against Poison and Fighting types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, its availability via the TM Machine is unlocked after defeating specific Team Star bosses or finding the TM in the overworld (notably in the Alfornada region of Paldea).
