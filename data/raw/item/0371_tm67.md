## Identity & Utility
**TM67** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Historically, its contents changed significantly: in Generation IV (Sinnoh), it contained **Recycle**, but from Generation V onward, it transitioned to containing **Retaliate**. It is a reusable machine (in later generations) or a single-use consumable (in earlier generations) that is widely available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/High-End).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon.
    * **Modern (Gen V+): Retaliate** — A Normal-type physical move with 70 Base Power. If a teammate fainted on the previous turn, its power doubles to **140**, making it a potent "revenge" tool.
    * **Legacy (Gen IV): Recycle** — A Normal-type status move that restores a used held item (primarily Berries) to the user.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling or have a negligible base power of 10).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Retaliate:** Primarily used in "Revenge Killer" strategies, particularly by Normal-type Pokémon with high Attack (like Slaking or Stoutland) to capitalize on STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and the doubled damage output. 
        * **Recycle:** Essential for "Stall" or "Infinite Berry" sets, often seen on bulky Pokémon like Snorlax or Chansey.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, particularly those with a "vengful" or "guardian" lore profile (for Retaliate) or high intelligence (for Recycle).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at major Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City, Goldenrod City, or the Pokémon League) for a high price. In Pokémon Black/White, it is famously gifted by Gym Leader Lenora after her defeat.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial tool manufactured by Silph Co. or similar corporations. It is occasionally found as a localized TM ball in the overworld or crafted via the **TM Machine** in the Paldea region using Pokémon materials.
