## Identity & Utility
**TM70 (Technical Machine 70)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Like all Technical Machines, its contents have shifted over generations: traditionally teaching **Flash** (Accuracy reduction/Overworld illumination) in earlier regions, it transitioned to teaching the powerful defensive move **Aurora Veil** in Generation VII.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium Acquisition**). The high price tag reflects its status as a high-impact tactical move in later generations.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. 
    * *Legacy (Gens IV–VI):* Teaches **Flash**, which lowers the target's accuracy and was historically used to light up dark caves.
    * *Modern (Gen VII+):* Teaches **Aurora Veil**, a move that reduces damage from both physical and special attacks for five turns. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Aurora Veil (High Viability):** A cornerstone of "Hail" or "Snow" teams. It acts as both Reflect and Light Screen in a single turn, making it a mandatory pick for Alolan Ninetales and other Ice-type leads in VGC and Smogon formats.
        * **Flash (Niche/Low Viability):** Primarily used in casual playthroughs or specialized "Accuracy-drop" gimmick sets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in Generations IV and V but became **reusable** in Generation VI and VII (before reverting to various craftable or single-use formats in the most recent titles).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually purchased at major Department Stores (such as the Heahea City TM Shop) or found in late-game icy environments (like Mount Lanakila). The 50,000 cost indicates it is a mid-to-late-game investment intended for serious trainers.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to overworld discovery, quest rewards, or high-end Mart purchases.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Alola region (Sun/Moon), this TM is highly sought after because Aurora Veil can only be successfully executed when it is hailing (or snowing), tying the item's utility directly to weather-manipulation strategies.
