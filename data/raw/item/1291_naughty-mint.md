## Identity & Utility
**Naughty-mint** is a **Nature-mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized aromatic herb that, when consumed, alters a Pokémon's stat growth patterns. Specifically, it encourages the growth of Attack while hindering Special Defense. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that acts as a late-game optimization tool.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Internally listed as cheap, but acquisition typically requires premium currency like Battle Points or League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the Pokémon's stat multipliers to match the **Naughty Nature**.
    * **Attack:** Increases by 10% (x1.1).
    * **Special Defense:** Decreases by 10% (x0.9).
    * *Note:* This change affects only the stat calculations; the Pokémon's original Nature name remains unchanged (this is relevant for determining which Berries might cause confusion).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (End-game Optimization).** Mints are essential for competitive play, allowing trainers to optimize the stats of Legendary, Shiny, or event-exclusive Pokémon that cannot be easily bred for a specific nature.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Quality of Life" item designed to bypass the traditional breeding loop for competitive viability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained at late-game or post-game locations.
    * **Galar:** Purchased from the BP Shop at the Battle Tower.
    * **Paldea:** Purchased from **Chansey Supply** outlets after earning a specific number of Gym Badges, or as high-tier rewards from **Tera Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured or specially cultivated item reserved for professional trainers and is not accessible in the early stages of a journey.
