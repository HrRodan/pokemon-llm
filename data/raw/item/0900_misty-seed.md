## Identity & Utility
**Misty Seed** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** An specialized, consumable seed that reacts to environmental conditions. It is a **Held Item** that is consumed immediately upon the activation of Misty Terrain (or if the holder enters the field while the terrain is already active). It cannot be reused in the same battle once consumed.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-tier**). While it has a purchase price, it is often treated as a specialized tactical tool rather than a common utility item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, this seed is consumed to raise the holder’s **Special Defense by one stage (+1)**, provided the battlefield is under the effects of **Misty Terrain**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling is inefficient as it provides no secondary effect and wastes the seed's potential stat boost.
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **high-utility niche item**, primarily seen in VGC and Double Battle formats. It is frequently paired with Pokémon possessing the **Unburden** ability (like Drifblim or Hawlucha), as the immediate consumption of the seed doubles the user's Speed while simultaneously providing a bulk increase. It is most effectively used alongside "Misty Surge" ability users, most notably **Tapu Fini**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Misty Terrain** field effect. It is a member of the "Terrain Seed" quartet (Electric, Grassy, Misty, and Psychic Seeds).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally found in the Alola region (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), often available at specialized Battle Facilities (like the Battle Tree) or high-end item shops in later generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is rare in the wild but can be found held by wild **Comfey** (5% chance). Trainers often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to farm these from Comfey in the lush jungles of Alola.
