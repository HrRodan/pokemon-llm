## Identity & Utility
**Never-Melt-Ice** is a **Type-Enhancement** held item introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A heat-repelling piece of ice that provides a passive offensive buff. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is holdable and active during battle. It is generally available for purchase or found in frozen environments.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the holder’s **Ice-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals low physical damage with no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is considered a **Niche Offensive Item**. While items like *Life Orb* provide a higher boost (30%) to all moves at the cost of HP, Never-Melt-Ice is used on Ice-type attackers (like Weavile, Galarian Darmanitan, or Kyurem) when the trainer needs to hit specific damage benchmarks for Ice moves without sustaining recoil or being locked into a single move via *Choice Specs/Band*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a damage-modifying tool for Ice-type specialists.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in icy caves or regions (e.g., Shoal Cave, Ice Path, or Mount Lanakila). In many games, it can be purchased at specialized item shops or late-game Pokémon Centers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is frequently found in the wild, held by Ice-type Pokémon including **Dewgong**, **Piloswine**, **Glalie**, **Snover**, **Abomasnow**, **Cryogonal**, and the **Vanillite** evolutionary line. It can be efficiently farmed using the **Thief** move or the **Pickup** ability.
