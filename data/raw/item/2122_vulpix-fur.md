## Identity & Utility
**Vulpix Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of soft, high-quality fur dropped by the Vulpix lineage. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine. It is not a held item and provides no direct benefit in battle.
* **Cost:** 35 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent rather than its sell price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as a component at the **TM Machine** to create Technical Machines (TMs). It serves as a specialized currency alongside League Points (LP).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an inventory-only resource used for out-of-battle preparation and move-set customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a direct byproduct of the Vulpix evolutionary line. It is required to craft specific moves that fit Vulpix's thematic profile (typically Fire-type or status-inflicting moves).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Vulpix** or **Ninetales** (including Alolan forms). In the Paldea/Kitakami/Terarium regions, these materials are automatically added to the player's inventory upon successful encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by Pokémon; it is a guaranteed drop upon the Pokémon's defeat.
* **Crafting Context:** Based on world knowledge, **Vulpix Fur** is typically required for crafting TMs such as:
    * **TM004 (Agility)**
    * **TM017 (Confuse Ray)**
    * **TM024 (Fire Spin)**
    * **TM038 (Encore)**
    * **TM125 (Flamethrower)**
    * **TM141 (Fire Blast)**
