## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CMA2282** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax boss. It is a **Consumable Utility** item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts (despite its nominal internal cost).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Event-only**; the cost is a placeholder as these are distributed via Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific empty den in Galar's Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to initiate a Max Raid Battle with a predetermined Pokémon. The raid remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld encounter generation and cannot be held in competitive battles to provide any stat or tactical benefit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is strictly a "spawn trigger" for the Max Raid mechanic unique to *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Exclusive** item. Dynamax Crystals with specific codes (like CMA2282) were typically distributed through serial codes found in Japanese publications (such as *CoroCoro Comic*) or via promotional retail tie-ins.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via Mystery Gift or Serial Code redemption.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals contain concentrated Dynamax energy capable of forcing a "Wishing Star" style reaction at the Watchtower Lair, a location specifically designed for these artificial raid triggers. Most crystals of this series (CMA/And/Star) grant access to rare encounters like Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or version-exclusives.
