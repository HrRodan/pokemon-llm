## Identity & Utility
**Gram-2** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** An essential piece of correspondence intended for delivery. It functions as a quest-specific item that cannot be sold, traded, or used in battle. It is one of three parts of a specific delivery objective in the Unova region.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This item is acquired through exploration rather than commerce.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held in the inventory alongside **Gram 1** and **Gram 3**, it can be returned to a specific **Wingull** located on **Unova Route 13**. Successfully delivering all three "Grams" rewards the player with **TM89 (U-turn)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is purely a narrative and sidequest-driven utility item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities. It exists solely to facilitate a trade-sequence for a Technical Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found in the **Unova Region** on **Route 13**. In *Pokémon Black and White*, players typically encounter this item by interacting with NPCs or finding it as a hidden item/dropped item near the coastal areas where the Wingull delivery quest is centered.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique quest item that must be located by the trainer to complete the "lost mail" sub-event.
* **Quest Context:** The item represents the second of three letters lost by a delivery Wingull. Returning these letters is a classic example of "fetch quest" mechanics used in the Pokémon series to reward thorough exploration of a route.
