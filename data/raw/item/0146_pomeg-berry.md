## Identity & Utility
**Pomeg Berry** is a **Effort-Drop Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A consumable berry used primarily outside of battle to manage a Pokémon's stats and temperament. It makes a Pokémon more friendly while simultaneously reducing its HP base points (Effort Values). It is a consumable item that can be grown in berry patches or purchased at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a party Pokémon, it **lowers HP Effort Values (EVs) by 10 points**. Simultaneously, it increases the Pokémon's **Friendship** (Happiness) by varying amounts (10 if Friendship is 0-99, 5 if 100-199, and 2 if 200-255). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Lowest tier damage; generally ineffective for Fling strategies).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When held and used via the move Natural Gift, it becomes an **Ice-type** attack with 70 Power (Gen VI+) or 90 Power (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** While not held in active combat, it is a **crucial administrative tool** in competitive play. It allows trainers to "reset" or fine-tune HP EV spreads if they were gained accidentally during leveling or if a player wishes to re-optimize a Pokémon for a different defensive niche.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates **Friendship-based evolutions** (e.g., Eevee to Sylveon/Espeon/Umbreon, Pichu to Pikachu) by boosting the friendship stat while clearing unwanted HP investment.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in Berry shops, obtained from Berry Masters, or grown in soil/pots. In most modern titles, it is readily available for purchase or through wild sparkling spots on the ground.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon; primary acquisition is through **farming and cultivation**.
* **Historical Context:** In Generation III, the Pomeg Berry was famously associated with the **"Pomeg Glitch,"** where lowering a Pokémon's HP EVs while it had low current HP could cause its HP to drop to zero or negative values without the Pokémon fainting, enabling various game-breaking exploits. In standard gameplay, it is the HP-counterpart to the Kelpsy (Attack) and Qualot (Defense) berries.
