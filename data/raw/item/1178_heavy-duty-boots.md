## Identity & Utility
**Heavy-Duty Boots** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** These sturdy boots protect the wearer from battlefield hazards. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought at specialized shops in later generations. In the context of gameplay, it serves as the ultimate counter-measure against "stacking" or "hazard-stack" team compositions.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Priced/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The holder is immune to the effects of entry hazards when switching into battle. This includes damage from **Stealth Rock** and **Spikes**, the poisoning effect of **Toxic Spikes**, and the Speed reduction from **Sticky Web**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** This item fundamentally shifted the singles metagame (Smogon) upon its release. It is mandatory for Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Rock (e.g., Charizard, Moltres, Ho-Oh) and highly recommended for "Pivots" that switch in and out frequently using moves like U-turn or Teleport.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a passive protection item that remains active as long as the Pokémon is holding it; however, it can be neutralized by moves like **Knock Off**, **Trick**, or the ability **Frisk**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sword/Shield), it is found in the Galar region (notably in the Galar Mine or Wyndon). In Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), it is readily available for purchase at **Delibird Presents** branches after the player has progressed significantly in the story.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically found** on wild Pokémon (Total held: 0). It is usually acquired as a static overworld find or via specialized item shops, reflecting its high-tech, utilitarian design.
