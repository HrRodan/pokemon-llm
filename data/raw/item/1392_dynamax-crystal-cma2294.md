## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CMA2294)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While a nominal cost exists in the data, this item is functionally priceless as it is typically distributed via external promotional codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty Pokémon Den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to summon a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon. The raid encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used in a hold-item capacity or thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for facilitating encounters. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for providing guaranteed access to specific Gigantamax forms or Pokémon with Hidden Abilities that may otherwise be rare.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a specialized encounter-triggering mechanic unique to the Dynamax phenomenon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Only.** Dynamax Crystals with "CMA" designations are typically tied to serial code distributions, such as pre-order bonuses, retail partnerships (e.g., GameStop, Target, or GAME), or movie ticket promotions. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is handled as a "Wonder Card" or "Mystery Gift" style acquisition.
* **Context:** The "CMA2294" suffix is an internal identifier for a specific distribution; while the generic flavor text masks the specific Pokémon, these crystals historically summoned rare threats like Gigantamax Copperajah, Duraludon, or Corviknight to provide early-game access to powerful Galar-native species.
