## Identity & Utility
**Solganium Z** is a **Z-Crystal (Competitive Held Item)** introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically attuned to the legendary Pokémon Solgaleo. When held by a compatible Pokémon that knows the move **Sunsteel Strike**, it allows the use of a signature Z-Move. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via special event or story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Transforms Solgaleo's (or Dusk Mane Necrozma's) signature move, **Sunsteel Strike**, into the high-powered Z-Move **Searing Sunraze Smash**.
    * **Searing Sunraze Smash:** A Physical Steel-type move with **200 Base Power**. Like its base move, it ignores the target's Ability (e.g., Sturdy, Multiscale, or Shadow Shield) during the attack.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats (such as VGC 2019 and Smogon Ubers). It provides Solgaleo and Dusk Mane Necrozma with a massive, single-use "nuke" move capable of OHKOing many threats, particularly Xerneas or Mimikyu, by bypassing defensive abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Specifically interacts with **Solgaleo** and **Dusk Mane Necrozma**.
    * Requires the trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** in the Alola region.
    * Cannot be removed or tricked via moves like Knock Off or Switcheroo if held by the correct Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, the player receives this crystal at **Mahalo Trail** after rescuing Nebby (Solgaleo) or at the **Lake of the Moone** depending on the game version and story progress. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, key-style item typically restricted to one per save file.
* **Lore context:** The Solganium Z represents the condensed light and energy of the Sunne Pokémon, Solgaleo, allowing it to unleash its full celestial power.
