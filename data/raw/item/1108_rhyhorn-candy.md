## Identity & Utility
**Rhyhorn Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized energy-dense treat used to bolster the growth of specific species. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used from the bag menu on compatible Pokémon. While it has a technical internal value, it is primarily an earned resource rather than a retail item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; generally sold to shops rather than bought from them).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a Pokémon in the **Rhyhorn evolutionary line** (Rhyhorn, Rhydon, or Rhyperior), it increases all of the Pokémon's stats—HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed—by **1 point** simultaneously. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the mechanics of the *Let's Go* series. It bypasses the traditional Effort Value (EV) system in favor of the **Awakening Value (AV)** system. In LGPE competitive formats, maximizing a Pokémon with species-specific candy is essential to reach the +200 cap in every stat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is exclusively compatible with Rhyhorn and its evolutions. It is ineffective on any other species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not typically found in Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired through the **Catch Combo** mechanic (catching multiple Rhyhorn in a row) or by **transferring Rhyhorn** to Professor Oak. It can also be obtained by walking a Rhyhorn in the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer for demonstrating mastery in catching or through stewardship (transferring). In the context of the Alola-era mechanics, it represents the "energy" or "essence" of the species distilled into a consumable form.
