## Identity & Utility
**Fire Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation I** (though associated with the Sinnoh region's Underground mechanics in this specific data profile).
* **Description:** A peculiar stone with a "fiery orange heart" that radiates heat. It is a **Consumable** item used directly from the bag to trigger permanent metamorphosis in specific Pokémon species. It can be bought and sold at most major regional Department Stores.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for evolutionary catalysts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a compatible Pokémon in the party, it triggers an immediate evolution. Per the provided data and expanded species compatibility:
    * **Eevee** → Flareon
    * **Growlithe / Hisuian Growlithe** → Arcanine / Hisuian Arcanine
    * **Vulpix** → Ninetales
    * **Pansear** → Simisear
    * **Galarian Darumaka** → Galarian Darmanitan
    * **Capsakid** → Scovillain
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself provides no benefit as a held item, it is the exclusive gateway to obtaining **Arcanine** (a perennial VGC staple due to Intimidate) and **Galarian Darmanitan** (a top-tier offensive threat in various formats).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a single-use item that is consumed upon successful evolution. It does not affect Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability if held, as it has no held-item function.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at major hubs like the **Celadon Dept. Store**, **Goldenrod Dept. Store**, and **Konikoni City**. In the Sinnoh region, it is a frequent find within the **Grand Underground** via the mining minigame (as indicated by the `underground` attribute).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is rarely found on wild Pokémon; however, it is a common reward for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability (typically starting at Level 31+) and can sometimes be obtained through the **Cram-o-matic** or as a reward for defeating trainers in specific Tera Raid battles.
