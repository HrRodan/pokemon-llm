## Identity & Utility
**Red Chain** is a **Key Item / Plot Device** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A mythical, glowing artifact forged from the crystals of the Lake Trio (Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf). It is designed to bind the legendary Pokémon of time and space. While technically categorized as "unused" in some game data because it is not a standard inventory item for the player in the original *Diamond* and *Pearl* versions, it serves as the central narrative catalyst for the climax at Spear Pillar. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** According to Sinnoh lore and game scripts, it is used to suppress the power of **Dialga** and **Palkia**, allowing the user to control them or prevent them from destroying the universe. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is specifically used to craft the "Origin Ball" or to quell the frenzied legendary at the Temple of Sinnoh.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-exclusive item with no application in VGC, Smogon, or standard competitive formats. It exists purely to drive the narrative of the Sinnoh region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the **Creation Trio** (Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina) and is created using the powers of the **Lake Guardians**. It does not trigger evolution but is required for specific legendary encounters.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, it is created by Cyrus of Team Galactic at the Galactic HQ and used at **Spear Pillar**. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, the player gathers the "Red Chain" materials from the three lakes to confront the disaster at the Space-Time Rift.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact of divine origin. It cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability.
