## Identity & Utility
**Up-Grade** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in Generation II (noted as Generation III in this record's metadata).
* **Description:** A transparent, high-tech device manufactured by Silph Co. that is packed with various types of data. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is used specifically to trigger the evolution of a particular artificial Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though typically found in specialized shops like Battle Frontiers or gifted by NPCs rather than standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Porygon** during a trade, the Up-Grade is consumed, and the Porygon evolves into **Porygon2**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has **no competitive utility** in battle. However, it is the mandatory gateway to obtaining **Porygon2**, which is a premier defensive staple in competitive formats (VGC and Smogon) when paired with the Eviolite.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly limited to the Porygon family. It represents the first "software update" for the Porygon line before the Dubious Disc is used to further evolve it into Porygon-Z.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically acquired at the **Silph Co. headquarters** or purchased via Battle Points (BP) in endgame facilities. It is rarely found in the overworld outside of tech-focused environments or as a reward for completing Pokédex milestones.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Porygon2** (often requiring the use of the **Thief** move or the **Pickup** ability to harvest in certain game versions). 
* **Lore:** The Up-Grade serves as a piece of "software" manifested as hardware, reflecting Porygon's nature as a digital, man-made Pokémon. Its production by Silph Co. ties it directly to the same corporate entity that created the Master Ball and the Silph Scope.
