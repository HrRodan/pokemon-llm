## Identity & Utility
**Meowth Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of fur shed or dropped by the Meowth evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting reagent used exclusively at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. It is a **Consumable Reagent** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource Material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific TMs at the TM Machine in the Paldea region. It has no direct effect on a Pokémon's stats, health, or moves when held or used as a medicine.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is strictly limited to out-of-battle movepool customization and the crafting economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX "Pokemon Materials" mechanic, where items are gathered from wild encounters to build more powerful utility items. Specifically, it is required to craft **TM028 (Pay Day)** and other agility or gold-themed moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after battling or catching members of the Meowth family.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is dropped by wild **Meowth** (Kanto, Alolan, and Galarian forms) and **Persian**. In the Paldean ecosystem, players typically farm this material by defeating Meowth in the wild or via Tera Raid Battles. It is a core resource for players looking to teach their Pokémon the move *Pay Day* for financial farming or *Swift* for guaranteed hits.
