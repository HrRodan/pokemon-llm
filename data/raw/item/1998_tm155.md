## Identity & Utility
**TM155 (Dragon Cheer)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the support move **Dragon Cheer**. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be manufactured at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via story progression and crafting). It typically requires **1,500 LP**, **2 Tatsugiri Scales**, and **2 Lapras Teardrops** to manufacture.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Cheer** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Dragon Cheer Move Effect:** Raises the critical-hit ratio of the user's allies. If the ally is a **Dragon-type**, its critical-hit ratio is increased by two stages; otherwise, it is increased by one stage. This effect only works in Double Battles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche Support** item in VGC (Double Battles). It is specifically designed to enable "Crit-build" strategies, pairing exceptionally well with Dragon-types holding a Scope Lens or those with the Sniper ability (e.g., Kingdra) to ensure guaranteed critical hits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for the evolution of **Dipplin into Hydrapple**. Dipplin must know the move Dragon Cheer (taught via TM155) and then level up to evolve.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating **Drayton** of the Blueberry Academy Elite Four in the *The Indigo Disk* DLC. Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked at the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured technology exclusive to the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions.
