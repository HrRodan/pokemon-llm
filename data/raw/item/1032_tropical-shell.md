## Identity & Utility
**Tropical-shell** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A beautiful white shell described as having drifted from warm, tropical seas. It is a **Consumable/Sellable** loot item that serves no functional purpose in battle or training; its primary utility is to be sold to Poké Marts for profit.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Value**). While it can be sold for 1,000 to 2,000 depending on the game's sell-rate mechanics, it is generally considered a mid-tier treasure item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** No overworld or battle effect. It functions strictly as a "Vendor Trash" item, meaning it exists only to occupy the "Items" or "Treasures" pocket until it is converted into currency.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effects upon hitting the target).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no stat boosts or passive recovery. In a competitive setting, this item is never used as it lacks the utility of items like *Choice Specs* or *Leftovers*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution for any known Pokémon species, nor does it interact with specific abilities beyond being a valid target for *Switcheroo* or *Trick* (though doing so is strategically disadvantageous).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the *Let's Go* series, it is primarily found as a hidden item on beaches (such as those on **Route 19, 20, or 21**) or received as a gift from the player's partner Pikachu or Eevee. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon in the current data set. It is most commonly gathered through **environmental exploration** (interacting with shimmering spots on sand) rather than through the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
* **Lore Context:** Its flavor text suggests it originates from a region like **Alola**, emphasizing the interconnectedness of the Pokémon world's geography and how ocean currents carry items between regions.
