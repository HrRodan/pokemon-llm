## Identity & Utility
**TR17 (Amnesia)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A data-encoding disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard TMs in its debut generation, this is a **Consumable** item that breaks after a single use. It teaches the move **Amnesia**, which allows the user to clear its mind and focus its internal fortitude.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). Note: In its native Galar region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** at Wild Area vendors rather than purchased with standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Amnesia** (Psychic-type, Status). When used in battle, Amnesia **sharply raises the user's Special Defense stat (+2 stages)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Defensive Staple.** While often outclassed by "Calm Mind" (which boosts both Special Attack and Special Defense), TR17 is vital for dedicated "Stall" or "Wall" builds. It is highly effective on Pokémon with high HP and reliable recovery (like Slowbro, Quagsire, or Snorlax) to make them virtually unbreakable against special attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time use machine; once the move is taught, the item is removed from the inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Max Raid Battles** in the Wild Area or purchased from **Watt Traders**. Its availability fluctuates daily as Watt Trader inventories rotate.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. TRs are strictly synthesized data records distributed through Galar's specialized Raid infrastructure.
* **Strategic Context:** TR17 represents a return to "consumable" move-teaching mechanics (reminiscent of pre-Gen V TMs), reflecting the high power-ceiling of the moves contained within the Technical Record library compared to standard TMs.
