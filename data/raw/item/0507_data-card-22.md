## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 22** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** A specialized data-logging device used to track specific performance metrics within the Pokéathlon. This card serves as a record-keeper for a trainer's failures, specifically tracking how many times they have finished in last place. It is a **Key Item-adjacent tracking tool** that **cannot be bought** with standard Poké Dollars.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; obtained via Athlete Points (AP) at the Pokéathlon Dome).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the cumulative number of times the trainer has placed last (4th place) across all Pokéathlon events. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the Key Items pocket or a specialized Data Card case).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on Pokémon stats, moves, or abilities. It is exclusively for flavor, completionism, and record-tracking within the Pokéathlon mini-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is purely a trainer-facing data log.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*, this card is purchased from the **Athlete Shop** located within the Pokéathlon Dome. It typically becomes available for purchase with **Athlete Points (AP)** after the player has fulfilled certain requirements, such as participating in a set number of events or winning specific medals.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a man-made electronic record and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Context:** Data Cards were a series of 27 collectible items in the Johto region's Pokéathlon Dome that allowed players to fill out their "Records" room, providing a detailed statistical breakdown of their mini-game career. Data Card 22 is notably one of the "negative" stat trackers, focusing on losses rather than victories.
