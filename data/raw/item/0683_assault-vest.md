## Identity & Utility
**Assault Vest** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** An offensive garment designed to be held by a Pokémon. It provides a significant boost to defensive capabilities at the cost of tactical flexibility. It is a **Held Item** that can technically be bought but is typically acquired through specialized vendors or Battle Facilities.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (interpreted as **Special Acquisition**; while the numerical cost is low, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and usually requires Battle Points (BP) or high-tier currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the holder's **Special Defense by 50% (1.5×)**. However, it imposes a strict restriction: the holder **cannot select or use status moves** (non-damaging moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output if thrown, though generally discouraged due to the item's high utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple**. It is primarily used on "Bruisers" or "Tanks"—Pokémon with naturally high HP or Attack that lack reliable recovery. It allows offensive threats (e.g., Tyranitar, Incineroar, Rillaboom) to survive powerful special attacks while continuing to apply offensive pressure.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Move Restrictions:** Pokémon holding this item cannot use moves like *Protect*, *Toxic*, or *Recover*. If a Pokémon only knows status moves, it will be forced to use *Struggle*.
    * **Ability Synergy:** Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability will not receive the Sp. Def boost, but they will also not be restricted from using status moves.
    * **Pivot Moves:** Moves like *U-turn*, *Volt Switch*, and *Flip Turn* are permitted as they deal damage, making them excellent for Assault Vest users to maintain momentum.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available at **Battle Frontiers, Battle Maisons, or Battle Towers** in exchange for BP. In recent titles (like Gen VIII and IX), it can often be found as a one-time overworld pickup in late-game areas or purchased at specialized shops like Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is considered a man-made tactical tool and must be obtained through trainers or specialized markets.
