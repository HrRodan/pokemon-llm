## Identity & Utility
**TM Case** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in Generation III (specifically within Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen, though categorized under Gen VII gameplay metadata).
* **Description:** A specialized organizational container designed to store Technical Machines (TMs) and Hidden Machines (HMs). It acts as an extension of the Bag’s "Key Items" compartment to prevent inventory clutter. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides a dedicated sub-menu for the player to browse, sort, and use TMs and HMs. This centralizes all move-teaching items into one interface, separate from consumables or Poké Balls.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely administrative item used for inventory management and party preparation outside of formal battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities. It serves strictly as a storage utility for the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift from an NPC early in the game to assist with organization. In *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*, it is given by the Pokémon Journal guy (or Teachy TV man) in Viridian City. In later generations, this functionality was integrated directly into the Bag's standard UI, rendering the standalone "Case" item obsolete in newer titles (though it remains in the game data for legacy/compatibility reasons).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. As a Key Item, it is unique and cannot be farmed or duplicated through the **Pickup** ability.
