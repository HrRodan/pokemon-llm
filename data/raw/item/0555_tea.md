## Identity & Utility
**Tea** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in Generation III (FireRed/LeafGreen) and reintroduced in Generation VII (Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!).
* **Description:** An aromatic, thirst-quenching beverage prepared by an elderly woman. It serves as a specialized Key Item used to bypass regional checkpoints. It **cannot** be bought, sold, or consumed as a standard medicine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When presented to the thirsty guards stationed at the gates surrounding **Saffron City**, they allow the player to pass through, granting access to the city’s gym, Silph Co., and the Fighting Dojo. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC or Smogon) as it exists solely to progress the narrative in the Kanto region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly for human NPCs (guards) and does not interact with Pokémon abilities, hold-item mechanics, or evolution paths.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *FireRed/LeafGreen* and *Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!*, it is obtained by speaking to the **old lady** found on the ground floor of the **Celadon Mansion** (also known as the Chief's House) in Celadon City.
* **Lore Context:** In the original Generation I games, players used a *Fresh Water* to bribe the guards. The **Tea** was introduced in the remakes to ensure players would not accidentally consume the gate-passing item, as Key Items cannot be used or held by Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item.
