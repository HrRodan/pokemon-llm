## Identity & Utility
**TM130 (Helping Hand)** is a **Machine** (TM) introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX** (*Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk*).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches the move **Helping Hand** to compatible Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** (one-time use, though craftable) item that **cannot be bought** for standard currency in shops.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through crafting or exploration).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a compatible Pokémon, it teaches the move **Helping Hand**. 
    * **Move Effect:** The user assists an ally by boosting the power of that ally’s attack by **50%** for that turn. It has a priority of **+5**, allowing it to execute before almost any other move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **VGC/Doubles Staple**. In a single-player playthrough, it is nearly useless, but in competitive double battles, it is a premier support move used to secure OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) for a powerful partner Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of "Support" and "Cute" archetype Pokémon (e.g., Chansey line, Eeveelutions, and various Fairy types).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically associated with the **Blueberry Academy** (The Indigo Disk DLC). Once obtained, it can be replicated at the **TM Machine** using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Crafting Requirements:** 
    * 400 LP
    * 3x **Happiny Dust** (sourced from wild Happiny, Chansey, or Blissey).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it are frequently gathered by hunting the **Chansey** line, often found in North Province (Area Three) or the Savanna Biome of the Terarium.
