## Identity & Utility
**Fire Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** material item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A rare fragment containing crystallized energy of the Fire type. It is a **Consumable/Material** item used as a specific currency for the Terastal mechanic. While it has a technical buy/sell price, it is not found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap to sell, but significantly more valuable as a modification resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Fire Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to **Fire**. This is a permanent modification to the Pokémon's Terastal potential.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle; it resides in the Treasures/Materials pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Priority.** Tera Shards are foundational to the Gen IX competitive landscape (VGC and Smogon). Changing a Pokémon to a Fire Tera Type is a common defensive strategy to gain resistances to Fire, Fairy, and Ice, or an offensive strategy to boost the power of Fire-type moves via the Terastal STAB bonus.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a mechanical reagent for the Terastal phenomenon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for completing **Tera Raid Battles** (specifically against Fire-type Raid Bosses). They can also be found as sparkling overworld pickups throughout the **Paldea** region, **Kitakami**, and the **Terarium**, or rewarded by the Academy Ace Tournament and various NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or Evolution stones, these are fragments of the Great Crater’s energy and must be farmed through Raids or exploration.
