## Identity & Utility
**Cornn Berry** is a **Baking-Only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A dry, yellowish berry that resembles an ear of corn. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** item that is primarily used for crafting Pokémon treats rather than direct consumption for health or status. In the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions, it is a staple for making high-quality PokéBlocks and Poffins to increase a Pokémon's **Beauty** condition for Contests.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Cornn Berry has no direct effect when consumed by a Pokémon in or out of battle. Its utility is strictly restricted to **planting/harvesting** and **cooking mechanics**. It is processed into sweets that enhance Contest stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It deals minimal damage and has no additional secondary effect when thrown.
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Bug-type** attack with a base power of **90** (Gen VI+) or **70** (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is entirely non-viable in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon, as it provides no tactical advantage or recovery. Its value is strictly limited to the Contest sub-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It interacts with the **Berry Blender** (Gen III) and **Poffin House** (Gen IV).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired from the **Berry Master** in Hoenn (Route 123) or from the **Berry Master's wife** by telling her the phrase "BEAUTIFUL CRITICAL." In Sinnoh, it is often found on **Route 211** or provided by NPCs in Hearthome City.
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is not naturally held by wild Pokémon in the provided dataset. It is primarily sourced through cultivation or specific NPC gifts.
* **Lore context:** Known for its hard skin and many small seeds, it is a popular ingredient in the Sinnoh region for making Poffins, suggesting it has a flavor profile that appeals to Pokémon with a preference for **Dry** flavors.
