## Identity & Utility
**Xtransceiver (Red)** is an **Unused Key Item** categorized under "unused" data within **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A high-tech communication device equipped with a camera, designed to facilitate four-way video calls. While the flavor text describes it as a functional communication tool, it is functionally a placeholder or "dummy" item within the Alolan games. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its current data state, the item has no functional effect ("XXX new effect" placeholder). In its original context (Generation V), it was used to communicate with story NPCs and other players.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists only in the game's code and cannot be held by Pokémon or used in any battle format.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it cannot be held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** Although it appears in the data for Generation VII, it cannot be acquired through regular gameplay in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* or *Ultra Moon*. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **World Knowledge & Lore:** The Xtransceiver (Cross Transceiver) was the signature communication device of the **Unova region** (Gen V). The "Red" designation typically corresponds to the model used by the male protagonist. Its presence in the Generation VII Alolan files suggests it is a leftover asset from previous engine builds or a scrapped cameo feature that was never implemented for the final release.
