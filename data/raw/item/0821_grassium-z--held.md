## Identity & Utility
**Grassium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon, it allows the user to upgrade its Grass-type moves into powerful Z-Moves, provided the Trainer has a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring. It is a **Non-Consumable Held Item** that is classified as a Key Item in the bag but functions as a held item in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This is a unique quest-related item that cannot be bought, sold, or traded.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it transforms a Pokémon's Grass-type moves into **Bloom Doom**. 
    * If the base move is an **Attack**, the Z-Move deals massive damage based on the original move's power.
    * If the base move is a **Status** move, it becomes a **Z-Status** move, granting secondary effects (e.g., *Z-Synthesis* restores all HP, *Z-Sunny Day* boosts Speed).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals **cannot** be used with the move Fling.
    * **Immunity:** This item cannot be removed from the holder by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, nor can it be swapped using *Trick* or *Switcheroo*. It is also unaffected by the ability *Sticky Hold* (as it cannot be removed anyway) or *Klutz* (which prevents usage but not the passive immunity).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats. It is frequently used to provide a one-time "nuke" to break through defensive walls. Common users include **Kartana**, **Tapu Bulu**, and **Serperior**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is purely for battle mechanics and does not trigger evolution. It is specific to the mechanics of the Alola region and is inactive in subsequent generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained through story progression in the Alola region. It is granted to the player by **Trial Captain Mallow** after completing the trial at **Lush Jungle** on Akala Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. As a unique Z-Crystal, only one is obtainable per playthrough, and it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
