## Identity & Utility
**Caterpie Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy-packed candy. When fed to a member of the Caterpie evolutionary line, it bolsters their physical and special capabilities. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold for a small amount, though it is typically acquired through gameplay loops rather than purchased at a standard Poké Mart.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Caterpie**, **Metapod**, or **Butterfree**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. This is part of the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series, which replaces the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is irrelevant in standard Smogon or VGC formats as it only exists within the mechanics of the Kanto-remake titles (*LGPE*). Within those games, it is essential for "Maxing" a Pokémon's potential, as AVs provide a massive flat stat bonus (up to +200 in every stat) regardless of level.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Rare Candy, this does not trigger evolution or level increases. It is strictly a stat-enhancing consumable. It has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in its native games.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through the **Professor Oak Transfer system** (sending caught Caterpie to the Professor) or by achieving high **Catch Combos** (streaks) of wild Caterpie in locations like **Viridian Forest**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer after catching wild **Caterpie**, **Metapod**, or **Butterfree**. It serves as a reward for "farming" the specific species, incentivizing repetitive catching to strengthen a specific team member.
