## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2777** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-exclusive consumable used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-Style Item** that technically has a internal cost but cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically distributed via Serial Code or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the stone pillar in the **Ruins of Watchtower** causes a specific Pokémon (denoted by the internal ID Gem2777) to appear as a Dynamax boss. The raid remains active until defeated or until the day ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a Max Raid Battle. However, it is highly valued by collectors as these crystals often grant access to version-exclusive Pokémon or those with Hidden Abilities and high Individual Values (IVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These items are not available in Poké Marts. They are **Special Acquisition** items, usually distributed as pre-order bonuses (such as the crystals for Larvitar and Jangmo-o) or through retail collaborations (like those at GameStop or Pokémon Centers).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard held items, these are injected directly into the player's inventory via the Mystery Gift "Get with Code/Password" function.
* **Context:** This specific crystal series (GemXXXX) represents the infrastructure for Galar’s limited-time "Wild Area News" events and physical distribution codes, allowing players to bypass standard encounter tables for rare or version-locked species.
