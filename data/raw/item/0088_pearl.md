## Identity & Utility
**Pearl** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A small, iridescent treasure with a silvery sheen. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot** be used for any practical battle or overworld effect other than being sold. It is categorized as "Vendor Trash," meaning its primary design purpose is to be converted into currency.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive** to buy, though it is rarely available in shops; it is typically sold by the player for 1,000 Poké Dollars, or more to specific collectors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a high-value trade item. While it sells for a standard rate at most Poké Marts, specific NPCs (such as the Ore Collector) may purchase it for a premium (up to 1,400 Poké Dollars depending on the game version).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no passive benefits when held and has a very weak Fling power. It is strictly for economic progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is a common reward from the **Pickup** ability in various generations, making it a reliable source of passive income for players using "farming" teams.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on beaches, underwater (via Diving), or as a reward for participating in various minigames (such as the Underground in Sinnoh or the Cram-o-matic in Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently held by aquatic shelled Pokémon. It has a high encounter rate on wild **Shellder**, **Cloyster**, and **Clamperl**. Trainers looking to farm money often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** on these species to harvest Pearls.
