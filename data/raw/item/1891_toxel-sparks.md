## Identity & Utility
**Toxel Sparks** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents shed sparks or biological matter dropped by the Toxel evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly in battle or purchased from standard vendors.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Common resource**). While it cannot be bought, it can be sold or exchanged for 80 League Points.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific recipe component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). Once used in a recipe, the sparks are consumed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item is stored in the TM Materials pocket and cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** While it has no direct combat stats, it is essential for competitive preparation. It is a required material for crafting high-value competitive TMs, most notably:
        * **TM048 (Volt Switch):** A core pivoting move in both VGC and Smogon formats.
        * **TM147 (Wild Charge):** A primary physical Electric-type coverage move.
        * **TM166 (Thunder):** A high-power move essential for Rain-based weather teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM crafting system introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching members of the Toxel evolutionary line in the wild. It is not available in Marts or Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Held Item:** Dropped upon defeat by wild **Toxel** and **Toxtricity**. These are most commonly farmed in the **South Province (Area Four)** or through mass outbreaks. Unlike traditional held items, these are guaranteed or high-probability drops managed by the Gen IX material drop system rather than the **Pickup** ability.
