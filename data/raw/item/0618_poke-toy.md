## Identity & Utility
**Poké Toy** is a **Spelunking (Escape Item)** introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** A simple plaything designed to distract wild Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used during a battle with a wild Pokémon to ensure a successful escape. It functions as the Generation V equivalent to the classic Poké Doll or Fluffy Tail.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during a wild encounter, it **guarantees escape**, regardless of the user's Speed stat or the presence of trapping moves/abilities (such as *Mean Look*, *Block*, or *Shadow Tag*). It is consumed upon successful use and cannot be used in battles against other Trainers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for single-player utility. It is highly valued in **Nuzlocke challenges** as a safety net to escape dangerous wild encounters or "wobbuffet traps" without risking a team member.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or specific ability interactions. Its primary mechanical value is bypassing the standard flee-check calculation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Pokémon Marts and specialized vendors in the Unova region and beyond. Due to its low price point, it is a staple for players navigating high-encounter areas like caves or tall grass without Repels.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial tool manufactured for trainers rather than a naturally occurring object. It is rarely gathered via the **Pickup** ability compared to more valuable items like Rare Candies or Leftovers.
