## Identity & Utility
**TM200 (Scale Shot)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the move **Scale Shot**. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **10,000 LP** and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Scale Shot** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Type:** Dragon (Physical)
    * **Move Logic:** The user shoots scales at the target, hitting **2 to 5 times** in a row. This move increases the user's **Speed** stat by one stage but decreases its **Defense** stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be held or used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** Scale Shot is a premier choice for physical Dragon-type sweepers (such as **Garchomp, Baxcalibur, and Roaring Moon**). It serves a dual purpose: breaking Focus Sashes or Sturdy abilities via multi-hit mechanics and providing essential Speed control to outpace threats in subsequent turns.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Technical Machine" category which, in Paldea/Blueberry Academy, utilizes the TM Machine crafting system.
