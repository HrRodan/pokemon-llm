## Identity & Utility
**Exp. Candy S** (Small) is a **Vitamin / Growth Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A dense energy supplement used to accelerate a Pokémon's growth. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that provides a fixed amount of experience points, bypassing the need for traditional combat-based leveling. While it has a defined internal cost, it is primarily an earned reward rather than a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 240 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically obtained as a reward rather than purchased).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon, it grants exactly **800 Experience Points**. This is the second tier in the Exp. Candy hierarchy (above XS and below M).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Preparation Staple.** While it has no utility *inside* a competitive match, it is essential for the rapid leveling of Pokémon to reach level 50 (VGC) or level 100 (Hyper Training/Smogon) without the variance of the Day Care or grinding wild encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Extremely useful for triggering level-up evolutions quickly. It does not affect Effort Values (EVs) or Happiness/Friendship to the same degree as Rare Candies or certain berries.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through **Max Raid Battles** (Sword/Shield) and **Tera Raid Battles** (Scarlet/Violet). It is frequently dropped by 1-star and 2-star Raid Bosses. It can also be found as a hidden item in the overworld or rewarded by specific NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Rare Candies, which are often found via the **Pickup** ability, Exp. Candy S is almost exclusively a reward for victory in Raid-based environmental encounters.
