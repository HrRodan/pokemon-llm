## Identity & Utility
**Strawberry Sweet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A small, strawberry-shaped confection specifically designed for the Pokémon Milcery. Unlike traditional "use-from-bag" items, it must be given to a Milcery to hold before a specific physical action is performed by the trainer. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that can be purchased or won.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Milcery**, the Strawberry Sweet acts as a catalyst for evolution into **Alcremie**. The evolution is triggered when the trainer performs a "Spin" (spinning the control stick) in the overworld. The specific form of Alcremie (the "Cream") is determined by the time of day and the duration/direction of the spin, while the Strawberry Sweet determines the **Decoration** (it becomes the ornaments on Alcremie’s head).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a single-use evolution item. Once the evolution occurs, the item is consumed. Alcremie itself is used in competitive doubles (VGC) as a support Pokémon (via the move *Decorate*), but the Strawberry Sweet has no utility in a competitive battle moveset.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically and exclusively interacts with **Milcery**. It does not trigger any "Baby" forms or interact with standard evolution abilities like *Pickup*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, these sweets are primarily obtained as rewards for defeating **Battle Café** masters (found in Motostoke, Hammerlocke, and Wyndon). They can also be produced via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a man-made delicacy within the Galar region's culinary culture, reflecting the region's obsession with sweets and tea.
