## Identity & Utility
**Forage Bag** is a Gameplay/Key Item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized container designed for gathering and transporting specific ingredients found within the jungle. It is a **Key Item** that is neither consumable nor holdable, and it cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Quest-specific item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its sole function is to hold trial-specific ingredients (such as Tiny Mushrooms, Mago Berries, and Honey) during Mallow’s Trial in the Lush Jungle. These ingredients are used to create the "special aroma" required to summon the Totem Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive battling (Smogon or VGC) and is strictly a narrative/mechanical tool for Alola's Island Challenge.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is purely a quest-progression item that becomes flavor-text/useless once the trial is completed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Provided directly to the player by **Trial Captain Mallow** upon entering the Lush Jungle on Akala Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique item tied to the Alolan Trial system.
* **World Knowledge:** The Forage Bag is central to the "Trial of Mallow," where the player must use Stoutland Search or environmental clues to find ingredients to lure out the Totem **Lurantis**. In the context of the Alolan lore, it highlights the region's focus on nature and the bond between Captains and the Trial-goers.
