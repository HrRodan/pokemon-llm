## Identity & Utility
**Tamato Berry** is an **Effort-Drop Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A spicy, red berry consumed by Pokémon to adjust their growth and temperament. It is a **Consumable** item that functions as a specialized training tool. It is primarily used to refine a Pokémon's stats by sacrificing Speed for increased friendliness.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon, it **lowers Speed Effort Values (EVs) by 10 points** and simultaneously **increases Happiness** (Friendship) by 10, 5, or 2 points depending on the Pokémon's current friendship level. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When held and used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fire-type** attack with 90 Power (Gen IV-V) or 70 Power (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is an essential **Management Tool** for competitive players. It is used to "fix" accidental EV investment or to completely reset the Speed stat of a Pokémon to repurpose it for different roles (e.g., transitioning a Pokémon to a bulky support set or a Trick Room attacker).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger a specific evolution, its ability to raise Happiness makes it an efficient (though resource-intensive) way to evolve Pokémon that rely on high friendship (e.g., Eevee into Espeon/Umbreon, Golbat into Crobat).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, Tamato Berries are obtained through **Berry Trees**, specialized **Berry Shops**, or gifted by NPCs (like the Berry Master). In modern titles, they are often found as sparkles on the ground in specific wild areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not commonly held by wild Pokémon in the core series data; acquisition is primarily through **cultivation and farming**. Once one is obtained, players typically plant it in soft soil to yield a higher quantity, making it a sustainable resource for competitive team building.
* **Flavor Profile:** Known in the Pokémon world for being intensely spicy, which explains its name (a play on "Tomato" and potentially "pimiento" or heat-related terms).
