## Identity & Utility
**TM47** is a **Machine** categorized under **All-Machines**, effectively acting as a permanent or single-use (depending on the generation) instruction manual for teaching a Pokémon a specific move. While the internal data identifies its origin in **Generation III**, the contents of TM47 have shifted significantly across the series history.
* **Description:** As a Technical Machine, it allows a Trainer to instantly teach a move to a compatible Pokémon. In earlier generations (II-IV), it contained **Steel Wing**, whereas from Generation V onwards, it typically contains **Low Sweep**. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. The move taught depends on the game version:
    * **Generation I:** Explosion (Massive Normal-type damage, user faints).
    * **Generations II - IV:** **Steel Wing** (Steel-type, 70 Power, chance to raise the user's Defense).
    * **Generations V - VIII:** **Low Sweep** (Fighting-type, 65 Power, guaranteed to lower the target's Speed by one stage).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines generally cannot be flung for damage in most generations; if they can, they provide no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Low Sweep (Modern):** Highly valued in competitive play (VGC and Singles) for **Speed Control**. It is frequently taught to fast physical attackers to cripple opponents who rely on Choice Scarf or natural speed tiers.
        * **Steel Wing (Classic):** Provides essential Steel-type coverage for Flying-types (like Skarmory or Crobat) to combat Rock and Ice-type weaknesses.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at Department Stores (like Celadon, Goldenrod, or Veilstone) or received as a reward from specific Gym Leaders. For example, in *HeartGold/SoulSilver*, it is gifted by the Gym Leader Falkner. In *Pokemon X/Y*, it is found in the Tower of Mastery.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be found in the overworld, received from NPCs, or purchased from specialized vendors (Technical Machine Marts). 
* **Lore context:** TM47 represents the evolution of technical move-teaching; while it once taught the self-destructive "Explosion," it has since stabilized as a tool for physical utility moves like "Low Sweep."
