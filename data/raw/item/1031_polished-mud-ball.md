## Identity & Utility
**Polished Mud Ball** is a **Loot Item** (Treasure) introduced in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A ball made of simple mud that has been meticulously polished until its surface reflects light. It is a **Consumable** item strictly intended for sale to Poké Marts. It serves no functional purpose in battle or Pokémon development.
* **Cost:** 1,200 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Value**). It is more valuable than basic vendor trash like the Tiny Mushroom but less valuable than high-tier treasures like the Big Pearl or Nugget.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item's primary utility is economic. When sold to a vendor, it provides a moderate influx of currency. It has no overworld use-case or passive effect on a Pokémon's stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30. If used with the move **Fling**, it deals minor physical damage with no additional secondary effects.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no stat boosts, recovery, or tactical advantages. It is categorized as "vendor trash" and is never seen in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions and has no interaction with specific abilities like Pickup (as a result) or Klutz (beyond the standard negation of its non-existent effects).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles. It is typically acquired as a hidden item in various environments or as a gift from a player's "Following Pokémon" or "Partner Pokémon" when they interact with points of interest in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held** by any wild Pokémon in the core series data. It is generally sourced through exploration or by interacting with the player's Pokémon after they "find" something in the grass or caves.
* **Thematic Context:** It represents the Japanese "Dorodango" hobby—the art of creating shiny spheres from simple mud. In the Pokémon world, it represents the bond between trainer and Pokémon, as it is often a "gift" found by a companion.
