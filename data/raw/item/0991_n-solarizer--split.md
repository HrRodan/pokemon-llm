## Identity & Utility
**N-Solarizer (Split)** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in system metadata) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item represents the specific functional state of the N-Solarizer machine used to separate **Necrozma** from **Solgaleo**. It is a specialized, high-tech device designed by Colress to reverse the process of light absorption. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Dusk Mane Necrozma** in the player's party, it undoes the fusion, resulting in two separate Pokémon: a base-form Necrozma and a Solgaleo. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself is not held in battle, it is the mechanical requirement for accessing **Dusk Mane Necrozma**, a dominant physical powerhouse in Restricted Sparring, VGC, and Smogon Ubers tiers. The "Split" function is essential for players to revert the form for training, trading, or switching to the Dawn Wings/Ultra forms.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item facilitates **Fusion**, a unique mechanic distinct from evolution. It interacts specifically with Necrozma. Note: The player must have an empty slot in their party to successfully use the Split function.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, the N-Solarizer is obtained from **Colress** on Route 1 (Aether House area) after the player has captured Necrozma. It serves as a permanent addition to the Key Items pocket.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique scientific tool crafted by the Unovan scientist Colress to manipulate the light-binding properties of the legendary "Prism Pokémon."
