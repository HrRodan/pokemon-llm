## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (SER5854)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal value, it is functionally a rare promotional item obtained via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty raid den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to force a specific Pokémon—associated with the serial code—to appear as a Dynamax boss.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld "Max Raid Battle" mechanic to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon, often those that are version-exclusive or possess Hidden Abilities/Gigantamax forms.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment and is governed by the Den mechanics of the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail promotions (such as those from GameStop, Target, or Amazon pre-orders). Each "SER" suffix typically denotes a specific promotional campaign.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to external distribution events.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent a concentrated form of Galar's Wishing Stars, allowing a trainer to summon a powerful Pokémon at will rather than waiting for a natural beam of light to appear at a Den. This specific crystal (ser5854) is one of several used to provide players early access to rare encounters like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax Copperajah.
