## Identity & Utility
**Travel Trunk** is an **Unused Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A light and highly efficient storage trunk designed to contain every piece of clothing a trainer can purchase. It is a **Key Item** intended for character customization that **cannot be bought** or acquired through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** According to its internal data, the Travel Trunk allows the player to access their clothing inventory and change outfits anywhere in the overworld, bypassing the need to visit a boutique fitting room.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic utility item with no application in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battling.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interactions with Pokémon evolution, breeding, or abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** While the item exists within the code of *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, it was never officially distributed to players. In the final release of the Alola games, players must instead visit the fitting rooms of apparel shops to change their appearance.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It represents a "cut" or "unused" feature meant to streamline the character customization mechanics introduced in the Alola region.
