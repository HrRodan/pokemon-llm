## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR6746** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears in the den until the end of the day. It is a single-use event item that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Minimal cost; signifies it is a **Special Acquisition** item distributed via serial codes rather than a retail product).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area), it generates a red beam that initiates a specific Max Raid Battle. 
    * **Specific Encounter:** According to historical distribution data for this specific ID (SGR6746), this crystal was used to encounter **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no battle effect, it is used to obtain Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, high Individual Values (IVs), and potentially Hidden Abilities, which are essential for competitive VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid, regardless of whether the Pokémon is captured or the player is defeated.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional tie-ins (such as those found in *CoroCoro Comic* or specialized retail pre-order bonuses). It is not available through natural gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized within the game data as a "Dynamax Crystal," a subset of items designed to give players controlled access to rare Gigantamax encounters outside of standard den rotations.
