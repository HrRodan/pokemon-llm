## Identity & Utility
**Pungent Root** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** These are wild herbs used specifically for cooking at a Pokémon Camp. Despite being described as "carelessly picked," they provide a sharp, fragrant accent to dishes. It is a **Consumable** ingredient that can be purchased or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range**; slightly more expensive than basic ingredients like Sausages or Tinned Beans).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a key component in the **Curry Dex**. When cooked with berries, it produces various tiers of **Herb Curry**. Successfully cooking with this item restores the party's HP and PP, heals status conditions, and provides a significant boost to Pokémon Friendliness (Affection) and Experience Points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be used in battle and provides no statistical advantage in a competitive environment. Its utility is strictly limited to the Pokémon Camp mechanic for party maintenance and Nuzlocke recovery.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several dozen ingredients required to complete the Curry Dex in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Regularly sold by **Ingredients Sellers** located throughout the Galar **Wild Area** (their stock rotates daily). It is also frequently found as a hidden item (sparkle) in the Wild Area or as a reward for successfully completing Max Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is restricted to regional commerce and foraging within the Galar ecosystem.
