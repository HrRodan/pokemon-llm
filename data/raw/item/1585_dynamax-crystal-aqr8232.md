## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQR8232** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once consumed, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use utility item that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap placeholder; however, these items are functionally **not for sale** and are typically acquired via serial codes or promotional distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it summons a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **AQR8232** variant is associated with summoning a **Gigantamax Corviknight** (or similar promotional encounter). The raid remains active until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch system clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld encounter triggering. Its value lies in providing access to Pokémon that may possess Hidden Abilities (HA) or the Gigantamax factor for use in competitive VGC or Smogon formats after capture.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **promotional bonus** (e.g., via retail serial codes or pre-order bonuses for the Sword & Shield Expansion Pass). It is not available through standard gameplay or Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these crystals are unique event triggers and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**.
