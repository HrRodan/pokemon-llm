## Identity & Utility
**Tri-Pass** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).
* **Description:** A specialized ferry ticket used to travel between the first three locations of the Sevii Islands (One Island, Two Island, and Three Island). It features a distinct illustration of three islands. As a **Key Item**, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique **Key Item** acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player permission to board the **Seagallop Ferry** at the Vermilion City harbor. It acts as a permanent unlock for transit between the Kanto mainland and the initial sub-region of the Sevii Islands.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. However, it is a prerequisite for reaching the **Mt. Ember** area (where Moltres is located in Gen III) and the **Pokémon Network Center**, which eventually leads to the acquisition of the Rainbow Pass for the remaining islands.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Tri-Pass is obtained as part of the main storyline in *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*. It is given to the player by **Bill** in Cinnabar Island’s Pokémon Center after the player defeats Gym Leader Blaine. Bill then invites the player to assist his friend Celio on One Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind logistical tool tied to the Seagallop ferry service operated by the sailor at Vermilion Harbor.
