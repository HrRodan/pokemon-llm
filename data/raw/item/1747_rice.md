## Identity & Utility
**Rice** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A culinary staple used exclusively as a filling during the Picnic mechanic. It is a **Consumable Food Item** that can be bought at various ingredient vendors. Unlike traditional held items, it is stored in the "Ingredients" pocket of the bag and is used to craft sandwiches that grant "Meal Powers."
* **Cost:** 280 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich during a Picnic, Rice provides specific numerical boosts to the sandwich's potential Meal Powers. It is most notably associated with increasing **Humungo Power** (which increases the likelihood of finding large-sized Pokémon) and **Encounter Power**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Overworld Only).** Its utility is strictly limited to the sandwich-crafting mini-game to influence wild Pokémon spawns, Raid rewards, or Egg discovery rates. It has no impact on professional VGC or Smogon battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available for purchase at **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Every Wich Way** outlets across the Paldea region. Access to this ingredient is generally unlocked after obtaining a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a mass-produced grocery item intended for human and Pokémon consumption during travel.
