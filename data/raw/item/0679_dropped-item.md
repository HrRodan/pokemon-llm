## Identity & Utility
**Dropped Item** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Pokémon Black 2 & White 2)**.
* **Description:** This item is an Xtransceiver lost at the Nimbasa City amusement park. It is a unique **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It serves as the catalyst for one of the most extensive sidequests in the Unova region.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When picked up, the Dropped Item triggers a long-term communication sidequest. The player receives calls from the owner as they travel throughout Unova. Eventually, the item is returned to its rightful owner—**Curtis** (if the player is female) or **Yancy** (if the player is male)—leading to a series of Ferris Wheel dates and specialized trading opportunities.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for world-building and story progression within the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, completing the quest associated with this item is the only way to obtain specific Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities** (Dream World abilities) in the post-game of Black 2 and White 2, such as Spiritomb, Snorlax, and Togepi.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a hidden item on the ground in the **Nimbasa City Amusement Park** (near the Ferris Wheel). It is unique to *Pokémon Black 2* and *Pokémon White 2*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a one-time quest object.
* **Lore Context:** The item belongs to an NPC who is secretly a famous idol (known as Christoph or Nancy). The quest emphasizes the "Xtransceiver" mechanic of Gen V, forcing the player to visit specific locations to trigger calls, eventually building a relationship with the owner.
