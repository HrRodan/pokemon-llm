## Identity & Utility
**Lost Item** is a **Plot Advancement** (Key Item) introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in the Johto/Kanto remakes, *HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** This item is a misplaced Poké Doll—specifically one resembling a **Mime Jr.**—that belongs to the Copycat, a resident of Saffron City. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought or sold; its value lies entirely in its role as a quest objective.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Lost Item serves as the catalyst for the "Magnet Train" sidequest. When returned to the **Copycat** in Saffron City, she rewards the player with the **Pass**, which is required to use the Magnet Train connecting Saffron City (Kanto) and Goldenrod City (Johto).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and unlocking regional travel. It cannot be used in competitive formats or standard battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interaction with Pokémon evolution or combat abilities. It is strictly a delivery item for a specific NPC.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *HeartGold and SoulSilver*, the player must first speak to the Copycat in Saffron City after she realizes her doll is missing. The item is then found inside the **Pokémon Fan Club in Vermilion City**, where a member of the club has found it and will give it to the player upon request.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-time acquisition per playthrough.
* **Lore Context:** While the item represents a Mime Jr. doll in the Gen IV remakes (reflecting the mascot of the era), the original *Generation II* version of this quest involved a Clefairy doll. Its presence in the inventory signifies the player's progression toward full inter-regional mobility between Johto and Kanto.
