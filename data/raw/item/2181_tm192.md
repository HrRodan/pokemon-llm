## Identity & Utility
**TM192 (Focus Punch)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically appearing in the *Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Focus Punch**, a high-risk, high-reward Fighting-type attack. As a TM in the Paldea/Kitakami region, it is a single-use consumable that can be reproduced via the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Poké Marts; requires crafting or finding in the overworld).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Focus Punch**. 
    * **Move Details:** Fighting-type, Physical, 150 Power, 100% Accuracy.
    * **Mechanic:** This move has **decreased priority (-3)**. The user begins focusing at the start of the turn; if the user is hit by a damaging attack before it can execute the move, it "loses its focus" and the move fails.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** Focus Punch is the cornerstone of the "SubPunch" strategy, where a Pokémon hides behind a **Substitute** to guarantee they aren't interrupted while charging the move. It is commonly used by Pokémon with high Attack and access to Substitute, such as Breloom or Conkeldurr.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to Pokémon that are compatible with the Focus Punch move pool.
