## Identity & Utility
**TR26 (Endure)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use teaching device that instructs a Pokémon on how to use the move **Endure**. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, TRs are consumable items that break after one use, returning to the classic mechanic of earlier generations.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Endure**. When used in battle, Endure grants the Pokémon a +4 priority window to survive any attack that would otherwise result in a faint, leaving the user with 1 HP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; not recommended for use with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic Staple.** Endure is highly valued in competitive play for specific synergies. It is used to reliably trigger low-HP items like **Berries** (Salac, Liechi, Custap) or to maximize the power of moves like **Reversal** and **Flail**. It is also a key component of "Weakness Policy" or "Endure-Max" strategies to stall out an opponent's Dynamax turns.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is compatible with a massive variety of Pokémon, as Endure is a "universal" utility move similar to Protect.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Pokémon Sword and Shield, TR26 is primarily obtained through **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts (typically 1,000 W). It can also be generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike TMs, which are often found as unique overworld treasures, TRs like TR26 are designed to be farmed through repetitive combat (Raids), reflecting the "Record" aspect of their name—capturing the essence of a battle for later teaching.
