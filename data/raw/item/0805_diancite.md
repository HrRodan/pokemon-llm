## Identity & Utility
**Diancite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized held item that enables the Mythical Pokémon Diancie to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. As a Mega Stone, it is a permanent held item that cannot be consumed or easily removed during combat.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through special events or specific NPC interactions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Diancie, it allows the Pokémon to transform into **Mega Diancie** upon the trainer's command at the start of a turn. This transformation significantly boosts Diancie's Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats while granting it the **Magic Bounce** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In standard play, Mega Stones cannot be used with Fling if held by the species that can use them for Mega Evolution).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Diancie is almost exclusively used with its Mega Stone in formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as Smogon National Dex or older VGC formats). Mega Diancie serves as a premier "glass cannon" and utility lead due to Magic Bounce reflecting entry hazards and status moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate permanent evolution; it is a temporary in-battle transformation. It is unaffected by the moves **Knock Off**, **Thief**, or **Covet** if held by Diancie, and cannot be suppressed by **Embargo** or **Magic Room**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** As a non-purchasable item, it is typically obtained by presenting a Diancie to a specific NPC. In its debut (ORAS), it was obtained by entering any Pokémon Center with a Diancie in the party. In Generation VII (Sun/Moon/USUM), it was made available via the Olivine City-themed area or specific Battle Tree rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is never found on wild Pokémon and is treated as a unique, legendary-tier artifact associated with the "Royal Pink Princess" of the Carbink colonies.
