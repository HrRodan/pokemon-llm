## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 17** is a **Data Card** (a specialized sub-category of Key Items) introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** This is a specialized record-keeping tool used to track performance metrics within the Pokéathlon. It specifically displays the total number of times the trainer has secured a first-place finish in the **Lamp Jump** event. It is a non-consumable, non-held Key Item that remains in the player's inventory once acquired.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through the exchange of Athlete Points (AP) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon inspection in the Bag, it provides a data readout of the player's historical success in the Pokéathlon’s "Lamp Jump" (a Jump-course minigame). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on Pokémon stats, moves, or abilities. Its utility is strictly limited to tracking minigame progress and achieving completionist goals within the Pokéathlon Dome.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of 27 unique Data Cards that players collect to fill out their Pokéathlon record profile.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*, this card is purchased at the **Pokéathlon Dome** shop. It typically becomes available for purchase with Athlete Points (AP) after the player has reached certain milestones in the Pokéathlon, such as winning a specific number of medals or entering the "Potential" or "Trust" rooms.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique key object tied to the Trainer's personal records.
* **Lore Context:** The Pokéathlon, located next to the National Park in Johto, serves as a major athletic alternative to traditional Pokémon battling. Data Cards like Card 17 are the primary way for "Pokéathletes" to prove their mastery of specific disciplines (in this case, the Jump course).
