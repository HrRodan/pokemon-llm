## Identity & Utility
**Olive-oil** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A culinary condiment used exclusively within the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be purchased at specific retail outlets across the Paldea region.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during sandwich creation, Olive Oil functions as a seasoning that contributes to the sandwich's **Meal Powers**. Specifically, it provides values toward **Humungo Power**, **Encounter Power**, and **Title Power** depending on the other ingredients used in the recipe.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in direct combat. However, it is highly valuable in the "meta-game" for **Shiny Hunting** and **Mark Hunting**, as it is a frequent component in recipes designed to trigger Level 3 Title Powers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. Its utility is restricted to the Sandwich-making mini-game.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Readily available for purchase at **Deli Cioso** branches, **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia, and **Sure Cans** outlets throughout Paldea. It is typically unlocked for purchase after the player has obtained a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a commercial product gathered via shops to facilitate the Picnic mechanic.
