## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CMA2491** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specific consumable used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Galar. Once used, a specific Pokémon—indicated by the internal variable—appears as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Promotional**). While it has a nominal price in the data, it is not sold in Poké Marts and is typically distributed via serial codes or special promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Wild Area's West Lake Axewell), it activates a unique Max Raid Battle. Unlike standard Max Raid Dens, which use Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific encounter that may not otherwise be available or may have unique properties (such as Hidden Abilities or specific IVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item functions exclusively as an overworld trigger for a raid encounter. However, the Pokémon caught from the resulting raid are often used in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Mystery Gift Serial Codes**. These crystals were historically tied to retail promotions (e.g., GameStop, GAME, or Pokémon Center distributions) or pre-order bonuses for the Galar region games or the Expansion Pass. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly limited-resource item tied to real-world events.
