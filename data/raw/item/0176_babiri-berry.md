## Identity & Utility
**Babiri Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Berry that functions as a reactive defensive tool. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that triggers automatically when the holder is struck by a move they are weak to. While it can be bought for a low price in specific markets, it is primarily grown or found in the wild.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is targeted by a **super-effective Steel-type attack**, the Babiri Berry is consumed to **halve (50% reduction)** the damage taken from that specific hit. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Steel-type** attack with **80 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a high-level **Competitive Staple** for specific archetypes. It is most commonly seen on **Fairy, Ice, or Rock-type** Pokémon (e.g., Togekiss, Tyranitar, or Hattarene) to allow them to survive devastating Steel-type coverage moves like *Iron Head*, *Flash Cannon*, or *Behemoth Blade* and retaliate or set up Trick Room.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** As a Berry, its effects can be recycled via the ability **Harvest** or the move **Recycle**. Its effectiveness is doubled by the ability **Ripen**, potentially reducing Steel damage by 75%.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through Berry Masters, specialized shops in later generations, or by planting and harvesting in Berry patches.
* **Wild Held Item:** This Berry is a rare held item for the **Snorunt**, **Glalie**, and **Froslass** evolutionary lines. These Pokémon are often targeted for farming via the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief** and **Covet** to bolster a competitive team's inventory.
