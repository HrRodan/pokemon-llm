## Identity & Utility
**Teal Mask** is an **Event/Key Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet* DLC, "The Teal Mask").
* **Description:** A weathered, teal-colored mask featuring intricate floral patterns and a legendary history within the Kitakami region. It is a **Special Form-Change Item** that serves as the default state for the legendary Pokémon **Ogerpon**. It cannot be bought, sold, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Ogerpon**, it ensures the Pokémon remains in its base **Teal Mask** form (Grass-type). Unlike the other elemental masks (Wellspring, Hearthflame, Cornerstone), this is considered Ogerpon's "pure" state.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung).
    * **Tera Interaction:** When Ogerpon Terastallizes while holding the Teal Mask, its ability changes to **Embody Aspect**, which provides a **Speed boost** (one stage). Additionally, it provides a 20% damage boost to all of Ogerpon's moves (similar to a Life Orb but without the HP recoil).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Competitive Staple** in VGC and Smogon formats. While the Hearthflame and Wellspring masks are often prioritized for their secondary typing, the Teal Mask is utilized for pure Grass-type utility, high Speed, and the ability to hold other items (since Ogerpon does not *have* to hold the Teal Mask to stay in this form, unlike the other masks).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon but is mandatory for Ogerpon to access its "Embody Aspect" Speed buff during Terastallization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the main storyline of the **The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero Part 1: The Teal Mask**. It is recovered by the player and returned to Ogerpon at the Dreaded Den.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact associated strictly with the lore of the "Loyal Three" and the Ogre of Kitakami.
* **Lore Context:** The mask was originally crafted by a mask-maker for Ogerpon and its human companion. It represents the "truth" of the Kitakami legend, contrasting with the false history initially taught to the villagers.
