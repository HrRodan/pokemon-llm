## Identity & Utility
**Stone Plate** is a specialized **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A stone tablet inscribed with ancient lore. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is primarily used to enhance elemental power or alter the biological form of specific Legendary Pokémon. It is classified as "holdable-active" and is traditionally associated with the Sinnoh Underground.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Affordable, though rarely sold in standard Poké Marts; usually acquired through exploration or excavation).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the holder’s **Rock-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Arceus Interaction:** If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (Arceus), the holder’s primary type changes to **Rock**, and its signature move, **Judgment**, also becomes Rock-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). Dealing significant damage when thrown, though the item is consumed in the process.
    * **Competitive Use:** In standard tiers, it is often outclassed by *Hard Stone* (which provides the same boost without the "Plate" classification) or *Life Orb*. However, in Ubers/AG formats, it is mandatory for utilizing **Arceus-Rock**, a formidable defensive and offensive threat capable of checking Flying and Fire types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is immune to being removed or swapped via *Trick*, *Switcheroo*, or *Knock Off* if the holder is Arceus.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically discovered in the **Sinnoh Grand Underground** via fossil excavation. In other regions, it is typically found in ancient ruins or provided by NPCs interested in the myth of the "Original One."
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It is a unique artifact typically found as a single-instance treasure or through repetitive mining minigames (Pickup does not apply).
* **Lore Context:** One of the many fragments of the creator Pokémon, representing the power of the earth and stone that formed the world's foundations.
