## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PSC596)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A single-use consumable item that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, the encounter remains active until the end of the day. It is a promotional event item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay channels.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but functionally a **Special Acquisition** item distributed via serial codes or events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty den in the Watchtower Ruins (Wild Area), it summons a specific Dynamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. This specific variant (**PSC596**) is part of a promotional series (often associated with retail distributions like Best Buy, GameStop, or CoroCoro) that allows players to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare, such as **Duraludon**, **Larvitar**, or **Jangmo-o**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) content. It facilitates the acquisition of Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors, which can then be trained for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanic in the Galar overworld.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in Poké Marts or via the Pickup ability. These crystals were primarily distributed as **Mystery Gift serial codes** through retail partnerships or pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* expansion pass or specific movie/magazine promotions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a limited-resource event item designed to encourage community engagement and visiting specific real-world or digital storefronts.
* **Location Context:** The **Watchtower Lair** (Watchtower Ruins) is the unique point of interest designated for all Dynamax Crystal activations, making it a landmark for event-based raiding.
