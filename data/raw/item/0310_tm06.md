## Identity & Utility
**TM06** is a **Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation I** (API categorized in Generation III).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to permanently teach a move to a compatible Pokémon. While the specific move taught by TM06 has shifted in specific spin-offs (e.g., teaching Light Screen in *Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee*), it is historically and primarily known for teaching the move **Toxic**. It is a utility item that transitioned from being a single-use consumable in early generations to a multi-use item in middle generations, and back to a craftable/consumable in the latest games.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Toxic** to a compatible Pokémon. Toxic is a Poison-type status move that inflicts the "Badly Poisoned" condition, causing the target to take increasing damage every turn (1/16th, then 2/16th, and so on). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Defensive Staple.** Toxic is the cornerstone of "Stall" and "Semi-Stall" strategies in Smogon and VGC. It is used by defensive walls to punish opponents that stay on the field for multiple turns. Poison-type users have the added benefit of never missing with this move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** TM06 does not trigger any evolutions. Historically, TM06 had the widest distribution of any TM in the series, being learnable by almost every Pokémon capable of learning TMs (famously including many non-Poison types) until Generation VIII, where its distribution was significantly restricted.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally awarded by the Fuchsia City Gym Leader (Koga or Janine) upon defeat. In various regions, it can be purchased at Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove) or found in poisonous environments like marshes and sewers.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial technological device.
* **Legacy Context:** In the Generation VII *Let's Go* titles, the flavor text indicates a shift to Light Screen, but in the mainline series (Generations I-VII and Generation IX), TM06 is the definitive method for spreading the "Bad Poison" status.
