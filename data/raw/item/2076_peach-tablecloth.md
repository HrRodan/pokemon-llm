## Identity & Utility
**Peach-tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative tablecloth used to customize the appearance of the player's picnic setup. It is a **Consumable/Key-Adjacent cosmetic item** that can be purchased and toggled during the Picnic mechanic. It serves no functional purpose other than aesthetic personalization of the environment.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at a Picnic, it changes the surface of the picnic table to a peach-colored pattern. This provides a visual backdrop for sandwich-making and interacting with the party Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic item used in the overworld. It does not influence "Meal Powers," "Egg Power," or any sandwich-related RNG mechanics; those are determined solely by the ingredients used, not the tablecloth.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts only with the **Picnic Mechanic** in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at **Picnic-Knacks** specialty stores located in major Paldean hubs, such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a retail-exclusive item designed for the trainer's personal inventory. Unlike Berries or standard Held Items, it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
