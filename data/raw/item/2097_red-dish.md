## Identity & Utility
**Red Dish** is a **Picnic** accessory introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** The Red Dish is a cosmetic customization item used specifically during the Picnic mechanic. It serves as a piece of tableware that changes the visual aesthetic of the player's picnic setup. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Customization** item that cannot be sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale/Special acquisition). While many picnic items are purchased at "Picnics Knick-Knacks" stores, a 0 cost typically indicates a default starting item or an item obtained through specific NPC interactions that cannot be liquidated for currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a Picnic, the Red Dish can be selected to customize the appearance of the picnic table. It provides no mechanical bonuses to Sandwich making (Meal Powers) and is purely an aesthetic choice for the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on stats, typing, or move effectiveness. It is strictly used in the overworld Picnic feature.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It remains in the "Main Items" or "Picnic" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, the Red Dish is part of the player's collection of picnic gear. Most tableware is acquired by speaking to the **Picnic Knick-Knacks** vendors located in major hubs such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia, or by showing the "Picnic Man" (found at various picnic spots) different types of sandwiches.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a human-made utility item for camping and sandwich preparation.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of Generation IX, customization items like the Red Dish allow players to personalize their "Shiny Hunting" or "Egg Power" sessions. While the tablecloth affects the overall look, the dishes and cups provide the finer details of the picnic's visual theme.
