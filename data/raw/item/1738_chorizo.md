## Identity & Utility
**Chorizo** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A savory, spiced sausage used exclusively as a culinary component during Picnics. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought at various food supply shops. Unlike traditional held items, it is used in the Sandwich-making mini-game to grant the player and their party "Meal Powers."
* **Cost:** 150 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Chorizo contributes to the final **Meal Power** results. It is a high-yield ingredient for providing **Encounter Power**, particularly for **Normal-type** Pokémon. It adds significantly to the "Salty" and "Spicy" flavor profiles of a sandwich.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Utility Only).** It has no direct application in VGC or Smogon formats. Its value lies entirely in "out-of-battle" preparation, such as increasing shiny odds (Sparkling Power) or boosting experience gain (Exp. Power) through sandwich crafting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-relevant abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is strictly a crafting material for the Picnic mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized grocery retailers across the Paldea region, including **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Sure Cans**. It is unlocked for purchase once the player has obtained a certain number of Gym Badges (typically early-game).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from vendors or occasionally received as a reward from NPCs at picnic spots.
