## Identity & Utility
**Lilac Tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative item used to customize the player's picnic set. It features a soft lilac hue and is used to change the aesthetic environment during the Picnic mechanic in the Paldea region. It is a **Permanent Gear** item (reusable once purchased) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When setting up a Picnic, the player can swap their current tablecloth for the Lilac Tablecloth via the "Clean Up" or "Decorate" menu. This changes the visual appearance of the table where sandwiches are prepared and Pokémon interact.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic overworld item designed for the social and sandwich-making aspects of the Gen IX games.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is part of the **Picnic** system, which is used for breeding (Egg discovery), friendship building, and gaining "Meal Powers" through sandwich crafting.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at **Picnic Knacks** specialty stores located in major Paldean hubs, specifically **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. This item is strictly obtained through retail purchase or as a potential reward from specific NPC interactions related to picnicking.
