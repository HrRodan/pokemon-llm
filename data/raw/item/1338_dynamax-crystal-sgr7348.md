## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (sgr7348)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, it triggers a pillar of light that forces a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear for a Max Raid Battle until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily distributed via external serial codes rather than in-game commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone ruin in the Wild Area) with this item in their bag, it initiates a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **sgr7348** variant is associated with forcing an encounter with **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, these crystals are high-value utility items for collectors and competitive players as they provide guaranteed access to Pokémon with specific **Hidden Abilities** or **Gigantamax Factors** that are otherwise rare or time-locked.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It strictly interacts with the Max Raid Den mechanics of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Exclusive** item. In the real world, this specific crystal was typically distributed via serial codes provided through retail partnerships (such as CoroCoro or promotional pre-orders) to allow players to encounter high-tier raids early or during specific promotional windows.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. It cannot be found on wild Pokémon and is not obtainable via the **Pickup** ability. It is unique to the player's inventory as a promotional "summoning" tool.
