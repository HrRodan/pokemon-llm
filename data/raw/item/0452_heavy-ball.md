## Identity & Utility
**Heavy Ball** is a specialty Poké Ball (Apricorn Ball) introduced in Generation II (and prominently featured in the Generation IV Johto remakes).
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball designed specifically for capturing high-mass species. Unlike standard balls that use multipliers, the Heavy Ball applies a flat modification to the target's catch rate based on its weight. It is a **Consumable** item that **Cannot** be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a rare, craftable, or event-only item depending on the region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to catch a wild Pokémon with a catch rate modifier determined by the target's weight class:
    * **409.6 kg (903.0 lb) or more:** Catch rate increases by **+40**.
    * **307.2 kg (677.3 lb) to 409.5 kg:** Catch rate increases by **+30**.
    * **204.8 kg (451.5 lb) to 307.1 kg:** Catch rate increases by **+20**.
    * **Less than 204.8 kg (451.5 lb):** Catch rate decreases by **20**. (If this results in a value of 0 or less, the catch rate is set to 1).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard Poké Balls cannot be used with the move Fling for damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no effect on stats or combat, the Heavy Ball is a **Highly Coveted Aesthetic** in the competitive community. Players often go to great lengths to catch Heavy-type Pokémon like **Groudon**, **Metagross**, or **Snorlax** in these balls to match their physical theme.
* **Interaction:** In the Johto region (HGSS), it is produced by providing a **Black Apricorn** to the craftsman Kurt in Azalea Town.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally unavailable for purchase. In most games, it is obtained through the Apricorn crafting system, special NPCs, or as a high-tier reward in modern titles (like the Cram-o-matic or as a Pokédex completion reward).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. Its scarcity makes it a "Boutique" ball, often reserved for Legendaries or rare heavy encounters.
* **Strategic Note:** Because it provides a **flat bonus** rather than a multiplier, it is mathematically superior to the Ultra Ball for heavy Pokémon with low base catch rates (like Beldum or legendary titans), making it the most efficient tool for those specific encounters.
