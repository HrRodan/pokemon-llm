## Identity & Utility
**Rowap-berry** is a rare Berry introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, retaliatory consumable Berry intended for use in battle. It is a **holdable-active** item that is consumed immediately upon being triggered by a specific move category. 
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap nominal value, though typically unavailable for direct purchase in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Pokémon holding this Berry is hit by a **Special Attack**, the Berry is consumed, and the attacker takes damage equal to **1/8 (12.5%) of its maximum HP**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; generally inefficient for Fling strategies).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dark-type** move with **100 Power** (Gen VI+), making it one of the strongest possible Natural Gift variations.
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **Niche Gimmick**. While it can be used to break an opponent's **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, or **Multiscale** (Dragonite), it is generally less consistent than the *Jaboca Berry* (which triggers on physical hits) or the *Rocky Helmet* (which is permanent). It is most effective on "bulky" Pokémon that can survive a special hit to ensure the chip damage is applied.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a tactical combat consumable.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically rare; Rowap Berries were primarily distributed through **special events** (such as the Gen IV Pokémon Movie distributions) or via specific late-game Berry Master NPCs. In more recent titles, they can be obtained through Berry mutations or rare wild encounters in specialized areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held** by any wild Pokémon in the standard encounter tables (Total held: 0). It must be acquired through cultivation or special distribution. Its rarity makes it a "trophy berry" in many casual playthroughs but a specific counter-meta tool in restricted competitive formats.
