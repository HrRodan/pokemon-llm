## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Shard** is a **Collectible** resource item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A small, vibrant yellow fragment that appears to be a piece of an ancient tool or implement. It is a **Consumable Trade Item** that functions as a specialized currency rather than a traditional medicine or battle item. While it has a listed cost, it is typically found through exploration rather than purchased at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Accessible/Trade Value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Yellow Shard has no direct effect when used from the bag or held in battle. Its value lies in **Bartering** with specific NPCs for high-value services and items:
    * **TM Exchange (Sinnoh):** In *Diamond and Pearl*, 10 shards can be traded for **TM37 (Sandstorm)** on Route 212.
    * **Move Tutoring (Platinum):** Essential currency for Move Tutors located in Snowpoint City, the Survival Area, and Route 212. It is often required in combination with other colored shards to teach competitive moves.
    * **Berry Trading (Johto):** In *HeartGold and SoulSilver*, Jugglers in Violet City and Fuchsia City will trade a variety of Berries (such as Sitrus, Iapapa, or Grepa Berries) in exchange for one shard.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It serves strictly as an out-of-battle resource to obtain competitive-grade moves or berries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a key target for the **Pickup** ability in certain games and is a common find in the **Sinnoh Underground** mining minigame.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Mining** (Sinnoh Underground), **Excavation** (The Dream World/Relic Castle), or using **Dive** in the Hoenn region to search underwater trenches. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally held by wild **Chinchou** and **Lanturn** (5% chance). These can be efficiently farmed using a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the encounter rate of held items, combined with **Covet** or **Thief**.
* **Lore context:** The shards are frequently described as fragments of ancient implements, suggesting they may be remnants of tools used in the early history of the Pokémon world, making them highly prized by collectors and historians.
