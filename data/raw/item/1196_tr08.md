## Identity & Utility
**TR08 (Thunderbolt)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** It is a single-use instruction module used to teach a Pokémon the move **Thunderbolt**, a powerful and reliable Electric-type attack. Unlike the permanent TMs (Technical Machines) found in most games, TRs are **Consumable** and break after one use. 
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Value Acquisition**). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for Watts (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Thunderbolt**. Thunderbolt is a Special Electric-type move with 90 Power, 100 Accuracy, and a 10% chance to induce the **Paralysis** status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output if thrown using the move Fling, though the TR is destroyed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Elite Tier.** Thunderbolt is the gold standard for Electric-type coverage due to its perfect accuracy and high base power. It is a staple on Special Attackers like Gengar, Starmie, and various Electric types to deal with Water and Flying-type threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is essential for optimizing the movepools of many competitive Pokémon in the Sword and Shield era.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword and Shield**. It is frequently available from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (price varies by day) or as a reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Electric-type Pokémon (such as Toxtricity or Raichu).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike TMs, which are often found as overworld items, TRs are intended to be "farmed" through gameplay loops like raids or currency gathering, reflecting the Galar region's focus on Dynamax energy.
