## Identity & Utility
**Poké Flute** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (represented here in its Generation III data).
* **Description:** A legendary musical instrument that plays a melody so beautiful it instantly awakens any sleeping Pokémon. It is a **Key Item** that is **non-consumable**, meaning it can be used an infinite number of times. It cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Plot Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In battle, using the Poké Flute immediately cures the **Sleep** status condition for all Pokémon on the field. On the overworld, it is a mandatory progression item used to awaken and initiate battles with sleeping **Snorlax** blocking critical paths (specifically Routes 12 and 16 in the Kanto region).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Key Items are prohibited in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon). In modern competitive play, its function is effectively replaced by the *Blue Flute* (which is a held item in some generations) or more commonly by the *Chesto Berry* and the *Lum Berry*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the unique "trigger" for the static overworld encounters with Snorlax. It does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained as a reward for rescuing **Mr. Fuji** from Team Rocket in the Pokémon Tower (Lavender Town). It serves as a sign of gratitude and a tool to help the trainer continue their journey toward Fuchsia City.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact within the Pokémon world lore, often associated with the Kanto region, though it appears as a radio signal (the Poké Flute channel) in the Johto-based sequels.
* **World Knowledge:** While classified under "Plot Advancement," the Poké Flute is one of the few Key Items with a direct in-battle utility in earlier generations, providing a permanent solution to sleep-inducing moves like Spore or Hypnosis during a main-story playthrough or Nuzlocke challenge.
