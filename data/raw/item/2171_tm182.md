## Identity & Utility
**TM182 (Bug Bite)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically appearing in the *Scarlet & Violet* expansion, *The Teal Mask*).
* **Description:** This Technical Machine (TM) allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Bug Bite**. In the Generation IX ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **800 LP** and specific materials like **Venonat Fangs** and **Kricketot Shells** to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Bug Bite** to a Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Bug Bite is a Physical Bug-type move with 60 Base Power and 100% Accuracy.
    * **Special Mechanic:** If the target is holding a **Berry**, the user eats the Berry and gains its effects immediately, depriving the opponent of the item.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** Bug Bite is rarely used for raw damage but serves as a high-utility "anti-meta" move in VGC or Smogon formats to punish opponents relying on Sitrus, Lum, or pinch Berries (like those held by bulky Pokémon or "Harvest" ability users).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the expanded TM library introduced in the *Scarlet & Violet* DLC, expanding the movepools of various Bug, Grass, and Poison-type Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item on the ground within the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask) or the **Blueberry Academy** Terarium. Once found, the recipe is unlocked at the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Venonat**, **Venomoth**, **Kricketot**, and **Kricketune**.
* **Context:** TM182 represents the return of Bug Bite as a teachable move after it was omitted from the base TM list in several previous iterations, providing much-needed utility for Technical Technician-ability users (like Scizor) who benefit from its 60 BP.
