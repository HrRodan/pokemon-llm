## Identity & Utility
**Heavy Ball (Hisuian)** is a **Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**. 
* **Description:** A primitive, specialized Poké Ball designed for the Hisui region. It is significantly heavier than a standard Poké Ball, resulting in a very short throwing arc. However, it is exceptionally effective at capturing Pokémon that have not yet noticed the player (stealth captures). It is a **Consumable** item used in the field.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale** in the traditional sense; primarily obtained through crafting or specialized vendors in Jubilife Village).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon that is unaware of the player's presence, it provides a significantly higher catch rate multiplier compared to a standard Poké Ball. Its heavy weight limits its range, making it unsuitable for catching Pokémon at a distance or those in the air.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move Fling does not exist in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, and this specific variant of the Heavy Ball cannot be transferred to modern titles as a held item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item exclusive to the *Legends: Arceus* single-player campaign. It is not used in VGC or Smogon formats, as it is used for field captures rather than held-item benefits in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the base tier of the "Heavy" line in Hisui, followed by the **Leaden Ball** and the **Gigaton Ball**. It does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Crafting:** Players can craft this item using **1 Apricorn** and **1 Black Tumblestone**.
    * **Purchasing:** Available at the Jubilife Village Craftworks or from Ginkgo Guild merchants for 120 Poké Dollars (though the base data lists 0, reflecting its status as a craftable resource).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. In the Hisui region, items are typically gathered from the environment (ore deposits and trees) rather than being held by wild creatures. 
* **Context:** Unlike the Johto "Heavy Ball" (which scales based on the target's weight), the Hisuian Heavy Ball scales based on **stealth and proximity**, reflecting the survival-based mechanics of the ancient Hisui region.
