## Identity & Utility
**Haban-berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable berry that provides a defensive buffer against high-damage Dragon-type attacks. It is a **Holdable Consumable** item that is technically purchasable but primarily acquired through cultivation or foraging.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically valued for its growth cycle rather than its monetary price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it is consumed to **halve the damage** taken from a single super-effective **Dragon-type** attack. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally not recommended for Fling strategies).
    * **Natural Gift:** Under World Knowledge mechanics, this berry transforms the move **Natural Gift** into a **Dragon-type** attack with a base power of 80 (Gen IV-V) or 100 (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **Niche Competitive Staple**, particularly in VGC and "Bring 6 Pick 3" formats. It is frequently equipped on Dragon-types (like Garchomp or Salamence) to survive mirror-match moves such as *Draco Meteor* or *Outrage*, allowing the holder to retaliate and potentially OHKO the opponent.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with abilities like **Unnerve** (which prevents the opponent from eating it) and **Ripen** (which would double its damage-reduction effect).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized Berry Trees or provided by the Berry Master/Berry-related NPCs. In later generations, it can be multiplied via the Berry Field or Poke Pelago.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Gible**, **Gabite**, and **Garchomp**. Farming these berries is most efficient by using moves like *Covet* or *Thief* on the Garchomp evolutionary line. It is not commonly associated with the **Pickup** ability, requiring manual discovery or wild encounters.
