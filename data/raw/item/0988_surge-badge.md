## Identity & Utility
**Surge-Badge** is a **Novelty Souvenir** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A commemorative item obtained at the Kantonian Gym in Malie City. Unlike the original Thunder Badge from Kanto, this is a "novelty" version that imitates the aesthetic of a Gym Badge. It is a **Key Item-style collectible** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, this item serves as a proof of victory over the Kantonian Gym challenge. It does not grant the player the ability to use HMs (which do not exist in Alola) nor does it affect the obedience level of traded Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battling format. It is purely a cosmetic or "trophy" item for the single-player experience.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions and does not interact with abilities such as Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is specifically acquired in the **Malie City Kantonian Gym** in the Alola region. Players receive it after defeating the "Gym Leader" of this facility, which is a tourist attraction modeled after Lt. Surge’s Gym in Vermilion City.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique reward tied to the Malie City side-quest.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents Alola’s fascination with Kanto culture. While it looks identical to the Thunder Badge, the flavor text clarifies it is a replica ("imitates the Badge of a Gym somewhere"), paying homage to the legendary Lightning American, Lt. Surge.
