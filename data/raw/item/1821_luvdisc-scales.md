## Identity & Utility
**Luvdisc Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Pokémon Luvdisc. It represents a shift in item utility where Pokémon-specific drops are used as currency/components for move-teaching items. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for League Points (LP) or used at a TM Machine, though it cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 160 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource-grade).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to out-of-battle move management and team building through the TM crafting system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the "Heart Scale" from previous generations, Luvdisc Scales are not used for the Move Reminder. Instead, they are specifically utilized in recipes for Water and Ice-type moves. Notable TMs requiring these scales include:
    * **TM034 (Icy Wind)**
    * **TM110 (Liquidation)**
    * **TM123 (Surf)**
    * **TM142 (Hydro Pump)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild **Luvdisc** upon defeat or capture. They are most commonly farmed in the seas surrounding the Paldea region (notably the North and East Paldean Seas).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense of older generations (where Luvdisc famously held Heart Scales), this material is guaranteed to drop from the species in Generation IX. It is a byproduct of Luvdisc's ecology, often associated with the "Heart" shape and sentimental lore of the Pokémon, though now repurposed for mechanical utility.
