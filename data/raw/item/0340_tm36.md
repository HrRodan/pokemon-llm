## Identity & Utility
**TM36** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. While TMs were historically single-use consumables, they became infinite-use in Generation V through VII, before returning to single-use (often craftable) formats in later titles. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sludge Bomb** to a compatible Pokémon. Sludge Bomb is a powerful Poison-type Special attack with 90 Power, 100% Accuracy, and a 30% chance to poison the target.
* **Historical Variability:** While primarily known as the Sludge Bomb TM, its contents vary by generation:
    * **Gen I:** Self-Destruct.
    * **Gen II–VII:** Sludge Bomb.
    * **Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee:** Thunderbolt (reflected in the provided flavor text describing an "electric blast").
    * **Sword/Shield:** Whirlpool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Sludge Bomb** is a high-tier competitive staple. It is the gold standard for Poison-type Special attackers (such as Gengar, Venusaur, and Roserade) due to its high base power and significant chance to inflict status, which can pressure defensive switch-ins.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Poison, Grass, and "dark/grimy" themed Pokémon (e.g., Muk, Weezing).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in locations associated with pollution, poison, or villainous organizations. Common locations include the **Team Rocket HQ** (Kanto), **Route 43** (Johto), and **Dewford Hall** (Hoenn). In many regions, it can be purchased at major Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City or Celadon City) once the player has progressed far enough in the story.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found as a localized item ball, received from an NPC, or purchased from a TM vendor.
