## Identity & Utility
**Bridge Mail V** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring an illustration of a vintage-looking brick bridge (specifically representing the **Village Bridge** in the Unova region). It is a **Consumable Held Item** used to send personalized messages to other players during trades. Once a message is read, the item can be erased for reuse or stored in a PC. It is **purchasable** and highly accessible.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a predetermined list of words and attach it to a Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** In older generations, Mail had a unique mechanical property: it **cannot be removed or swapped** in battle. Moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Covet*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo* will fail against a Pokémon holding Mail. While this provides "sticky" protection, the lack of a stat-boosting effect makes it inferior to competitive staples like *Life Orb* or *Leftovers*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Mail **cannot** be placed into a PC Box. The Mail must be removed before the Pokémon can be stored.
    * **Ability Interaction:** The ability **Klutz** prevents a Pokémon from using items, but the "anti-theft" property of Mail often still applies.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily sold at the **Village Bridge** in the Unova region. It is part of a series of "Bridge Mails" (including Initial, Sky, Arrow, and Dream Mail) that celebrate the architectural landmarks of the region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired via specialty vendors or Marts in specific locations across the Unova, Kalos, and Hoenn (ORAS) regions.
* **Lore Context:** The "V" in the name refers to **Village Bridge**, a 200-year-old stone bridge in Unova known for its residents living atop the structure and its distinct musical theme.
