## Identity & Utility
**Geodude Fragment** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A physical material dropped by members of the Geodude evolutionary line. It serves as a specialized crafting component used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM). It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of League Points (LP) or used in recipes.
* **Cost:** 30 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Fodder value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). While the fragment itself provides no direct benefit to a Pokémon, it is essential for accessing powerful Rock-type and Ground-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in battle. Its value is strictly logistical, enabling the player to teach competitive moves to their team outside of combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "TM Materials" ecosystem used exclusively in the Paldea, Kitakami, and Blueberry Academy regions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching wild **Geodude**, **Graveler**, or **Golem**. In Generation IX, these are primarily found in the canyons of the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC) or the Canyon Biome of the **Blueberry Academy** (The Indigo Disk DLC).
* **Crafting Utility:** World knowledge indicates this material is a prerequisite for crafting high-value TMs, including:
    * **TM076 (Rock Blast)**
    * **TM116 (Stealth Rock)**
    * **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**
    * **TM149 (Earthquake)** (Note: Requirements vary by game version, but Geodude Fragments are standard for Rock-themed TMs).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by the Pokémon; rather, it is a guaranteed "drop" upon the Pokémon's defeat in the overworld or via Auto-Battles (Let's Go feature).
