## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal GRU8425** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use promotional item that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal placeholder cost; technically **Not for sale** as it is a promotional distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, this crystal summons a **Gigantamax Sandaconda** Max Raid Battle. The raid allows the player (and invited allies) to battle and attempt to catch a Pokémon with the Gigantamax Factor, which is otherwise restricted to specific den spawns or the Max Soup mechanic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item resides in the Other Items pocket and cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for out-of-battle encounter generation. However, the resulting Pokémon (Gigantamax Sandaconda) has niche competitive utility due to its "G-Max Sandblast" move, which traps opponents and deals residual damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark, turning an empty den into an active pillar of light.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed via **serial codes** as part of retail promotions (such as those through GAME in the UK or GameStop in the US). Once the code is redeemed and the item is used, the raid remains active until midnight of the day of activation.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-exclusive distribution item.
