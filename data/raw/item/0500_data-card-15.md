## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 15** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** It is a specialized information-tracking item used exclusively for the Pokéathlon minigame. It functions as a record-keeping device that monitors a specific performance metric. It is a **Key Item-adjacent utility** that **cannot** be bought with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is typically acquired via the Pokéathlon Dome's exchange service using Athlete Points (AP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the cumulative number of times the trainer’s Pokémon have "fallen" (fainted or been knocked down) during Pokéathlon events.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held or used in a standard Pokémon battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. Its value is strictly limited to the Pokéathlon side-activity for completionists and stat-trackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it cannot be held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (located north of Goldenrod City in Johto). Players must exchange **500 Athlete Points (AP)** at the Card Shop to unlock this specific data tracking.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique data-logging tool tied to the Trainer's Pokéathlon career. 
* **Context:** Data Card 15 is part of a series of 27 cards. While many cards track positive stats (wins, jumps, points), this specific card tracks a "failure" metric (falls), providing a comprehensive look at the player's history within the Johto region's premier athletic competition.
