## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (UMA4660)** is a **Special Event Consumable** (categorized under Dynamax Crystals) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a promotional item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to spawn until the end of the day. It is a consumable utility item that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; while it has a nominal value in the data, it is not sold in Poke Marts and is distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, a pillar of light appears. This initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon associated with the UMA4660 ID.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** These crystals were often used to provide early or guaranteed access to Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities (HA)** or **Gigantamax** capabilities, which are vital for building competitive VGC or Smogon teams. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is strictly tied to the **Dynamax/Max Raid** mechanic of the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events. These were typically tied to pre-order bonuses, retail distributions (such as GameStop or Target), or special movie/event tie-ins during the *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* era.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. This is an event-exclusive item that exists outside of the standard encounter or **Pickup** ability loot tables.
