## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (★Per834)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay channels. While categorized as a consumable, it functions similarly to a "Key Item" by unlocking a specific encounter.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**; primarily distributed via promotional codes rather than sold in marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of Galar's Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—typically a rare encounter or a Gigantamax-capable species—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) tool. Its value lies in providing access to specific Pokémon that may possess Competitive-grade Hidden Abilities, High IVs, or Gigantamax forms used in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are **Special Distribution** items. They were historically obtained via serial codes from retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or Amazon) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass or Double Packs.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces that attract random encounters to any den, a "Per" series Crystal (like Per834) is "tuned" to a specific frequency to summon a predetermined, powerful Dynamax Pokémon to a specific historical site (the Watchtower).
