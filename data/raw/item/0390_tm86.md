## Identity & Utility
**TM86 (Grass Knot)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide Pokémon with the move **Grass Knot**. As a Technical Machine, it allows a wide variety of Pokémon—even those not of the Grass type—to learn a powerful Special Grass-type attack. It is a **Consumable/Multi-use** item (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that is widely accessible.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Grass Knot** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * *Move Mechanics:* Grass Knot is a Special Grass-type move that deals damage based on the **target's weight**. The heavier the opponent, the greater the power (ranging from 20 to 120 Base Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling or have negligible power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple Coverage.** Grass Knot is a vital competitive tool for Special Attackers (such as Electric, Psychic, or Fairy types) to counter heavy-weight threats like **Kyogre, Groudon, Hippowdon, and Dondozo**. It is preferred over Energy Ball when the primary targets are known to be massive.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a vast array of Pokémon, including many non-Grass types that can "trip" opponents with vines or telekinesis.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically given by **Gym Leader Gardenia** in Eterna City (Diamond/Pearl/Platinum). In subsequent generations, it is frequently found in TM Shops or Department Stores for 1000 Poké Dollars, or crafted using the TM Machine (Scarlet/Violet) using materials like Foongus Spores and Gossifleur Dust.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through gym victories, overworld exploration, or direct purchase from Marts.
* **Contextual Note:** While the provided flavor text in the data suggests a vanishing/protection-piercing effect (characteristic of *Phantom Force*), TM86 is universally recognized across all core series data as the move **Grass Knot**.
