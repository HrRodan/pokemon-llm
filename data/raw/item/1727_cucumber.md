## Identity & Utility
**Cucumber** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A sliced food item used specifically within the Picnic sandwich-making mechanic. It is a consumable culinary ingredient that can be bought in bulk for crafting various Meal Powers.
* **Cost:** 130 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a sandwich topping, it contributes to the dish's flavor profile and resulting **Meal Powers**. Specifically, Cucumber provides a **Salty** and **Bitter** flavor profile. It is a core ingredient in several standard recipes (such as the Vegetable Sandwich) and is frequently used to influence **Encounter Power**, **Catching Power**, and **Item Drop Power** for specific types (notably Fighting and Grass types).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients are categorized as picnic items and cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Indirect. While it has no utility in a Pokémon battle, it is essential for the "pre-game" competitive loop—used to trigger **Egg Power** for faster breeding or **Sparkling Power** for hunting competitive-ready Shiny Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic** mini-game and the **Meal Power** calculation engine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized grocery retailers across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Sure Cans**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and the **Delibird Presents** (grocery sections) in major hubs like Mesagoza, Levincia, and Cascarrafa.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a player-purchased commodity for the sandwich mechanic.
