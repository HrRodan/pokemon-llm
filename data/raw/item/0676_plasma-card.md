## Identity & Utility
**Plasma Card** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V** (specifically in *Pokémon Black 2 and White 2*).
* **Description:** A specialized electronic key card used to bypass security systems on the **Plasma Frigate**, the mobile headquarters of Team Plasma. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or discarded, as it is essential for story progression.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to the terminal system inside the Plasma Frigate. It is specifically required to enter the password that deactivates the electric barriers blocking the way to the deeper sections of the ship (leading to encounters with Colress, Ghetsis, and Kyurem).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for single-player campaign progression and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battle format.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions purely as a mechanical "flag" to allow the player to interact with specific environment tiles (the security terminals).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the late-game events of *Pokémon Black 2 and White 2*. It is typically acquired after defeating a specific Team Plasma Grunt (or a pair of Grunts) on the **Plasma Frigate** while docked at the Giant Chasm. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item linked to the Unova region's plot.
* **Lore Context:** The card signifies the player's infiltration of Team Plasma's technological stronghold. In the narrative, the password required alongside this card often reflects Team Plasma’s ideology or their current goals (e.g., "9909," "1101," or the names of the legendary dragons).
