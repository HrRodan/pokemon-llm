## Identity & Utility
**Bottle Cap** (Silver) is a valuable training resource and loot item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A beautiful, silver-gleaming cap that serves as a unique currency. It is a **Consumable** item used to facilitate **Hyper Training**, allowing a Trainer to artificially maximize the potential of a Pokémon's specific stats. While technically categorized as "loot," its utility is strictly for high-level Pokémon development.
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). In recent generations, it can be purchased at specialty shops like Delibird Presents or acquired via Battle Points (BP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When traded to the **Hyper Trainer** (e.g., Mr. Hyper), it "Hyper Trains" a single stat of a level-capped Pokémon (Lv. 100 in Gen 7-8; Lv. 50+ in Gen 9). This sets the selected stat's **Individual Value (IV)** to a functional maximum of **31**. 
    * *Note:* The game treats the stat as if it has a 31 IV for battle calculations, though for breeding purposes, the original IVs are retained.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Staple.** It is the primary method for optimizing the stats of Legendary Pokémon, Sub-Legendaries, and Shiny Pokémon that cannot be easily bred for perfect IVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Hyper Trainer** NPC found in various regions (Hau'oli City, Wyndon, or Montenevera). It does not trigger evolution or interact with standard abilities like Pickup for combat benefits.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Generation VII/VIII:** Often rewarded from high-streak victories in battle facilities (Battle Tree/Battle Tower) or rare drops from Max Raid Dens.
    * **Generation IX:** Readily available for purchase at **Delibird Presents** after reaching a specific gym badge threshold, marking a shift from a rare reward to a standard competitive tool.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through endgame activities, high-level **Tera Raid Battles**, or occasionally found by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at very high levels (Lv. 70+).
