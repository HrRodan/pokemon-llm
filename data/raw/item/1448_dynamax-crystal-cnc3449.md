## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cnc3449)** is a **Special Event Consumable** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Wild Area of the Galar region. Once consumed, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the technical cost is low, these items are functionally priceless as they are typically distributed via unique serial codes from retail promotions or magazines.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty den at the Watchtower Lair while carrying this crystal, a pillar of light is generated. This allows the player to challenge a specific **Gigantamax Pokémon** (specifically associated with the `cnc3449` distribution, such as **Gigantamax Corviknight** or other retail-exclusive encounters) in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** The crystal itself has no battle utility, but it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that may possess a **Hidden Ability (HA)**, high individual values (IVs), or the **Gigantamax Factor**, which are essential for building competitive VGC or Smogon teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** geography in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It does not trigger evolutions but enables the capture of Pokémon capable of Gigantamaxing.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **Event-Exclusive**. It was distributed via serial codes (often through retailers like GameStop, Pokémon Center, or international hobby magazines). It is not available in Poké Marts or through standard overworld exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is an "Item Pocket" utility piece that must be intentionally activated at a specific landmark to function.
