## Identity & Utility
**Damp Rock** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized stone that retains moisture. It is a holdable item designed for active battle use. Unlike consumable medicines, it remains equipped to the Pokémon to modify weather mechanics. It is generally available for purchase or through specific environmental interaction.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; accessible mid-to-late game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that uses the move **Rain Dance** or possesses the ability **Drizzle**, the duration of the resulting rain is extended from the standard 5 turns to **8 turns**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Moderate physical damage when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** The Damp Rock is a cornerstone of "Rain Offense" archetypes in Smogon and VGC formats. By extending rain to 8 turns, it provides the necessary window for "Swift Swim" sweepers (like Kingdra or Barraskewda) to navigate switches and protect turns without the weather expiring prematurely.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its effect is unique because it modifies the *initial move/ability activation*; once the 8-turn rain is set, the duration remains 8 turns even if the Damp Rock holder switches out or has its item removed (via Knock Off or Thief).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in moist or subterranean environments. In its debut generation (Sinnoh), it was primarily excavated from the **Great Underground**. In modern titles, it is often sold at specialty marts or Battle Frontier/Delibird Presents shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon** (0% natural encounter rate in most data). It is most frequently acquired as a fixed-position hidden item in rainy routes or through the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets depending on the game version.
* **Context:** It is part of a quartet of weather-extending rocks, alongside the Heat Rock (Sun), Smooth Rock (Sand), and Icy Rock (Snow/Hail).
