## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Per1228** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair within the Galar Wild Area. Once consumed, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, typically associated with event distributions like **Copperajah**—which remains active until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; functionally **Not for sale** and acquired via Serial Code).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone structure in the Wild Area), a pillar of light appears, initiating a Max Raid Battle. The crystal is consumed upon the raid's activation. The encounter is unique and persists even if the player loses the battle, allowing for multiple attempts until the Pokémon is caught or the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate a single-player or cooperative Max Raid encounter in the overworld. It cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not trigger evolutions or interact with standard Pokémon abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional **Serial Code** or via special retail events (such as those at Pokémon Centers or partner retailers). It is not available in Poké Marts or through natural exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item intended for high-level raid encounters.
* **World Knowledge:** The "★Per" prefix in the item's internal name typically denotes a specific event identifier. These crystals were used throughout the *Sword & Shield* era to allow players to face Gigantamax or rare Pokémon at their convenience without relying on the standard RNG of the Wild Area dens.
