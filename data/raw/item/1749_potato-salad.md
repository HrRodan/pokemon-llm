## Identity & Utility
**Potato Salad** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A prepared culinary topping used exclusively in the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable grocery item used to influence Meal Powers. It cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and is used solely for overworld preparation.
* **Cost:** 110 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as an ingredient in a sandwich, it contributes specific points toward **Meal Powers**. Specifically, Potato Salad is a key component for increasing **Humungo Power** (which increases the size of wild Pokémon encountered) and **Exp. Power**. It adds a "Salty" and "Sweet" flavor profile.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Mechanic-specific).** While it has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, it is vital for the "Shiny Hunting" and "Breeding" metagame by optimizing encounter rates and experience gains through the Sandwich system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic/Sandwich-making** mini-game in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at **Deli Cioso** shops and certain **Aura Ray** supermarkets located in major Paldean cities such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a processed food item intended for human/Pokémon co-consumption during travel and is primarily sourced through retail purchase.
