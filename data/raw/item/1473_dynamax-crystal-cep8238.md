## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CEP8238** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a consumable event-specific item used in the Galar region. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—specifically **Gigantamax Corviknight**—which persists until the end of the day. It is a consumable utility item that cannot be bought in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Symbolic; typically obtained via serial code rather than purchased).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is triggered. This allows the player to challenge a **Gigantamax Corviknight** in a Max Raid Battle. The encounter is guaranteed regardless of the current weather or natural den spawns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This is a progression/collection item. However, it is highly valued for obtaining a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor** and potentially Hidden Abilities for competitive use.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but provides access to a Gigantamax-capable specimen which would otherwise require Max Soup (from the Isle of Armor DLC) or rare Max Raid spawns.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (CEP8238) was distributed as a **promotional Serial Code** item, often bundled with physical purchases such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack or specific CoroCoro Comic promotions. It is not available through normal gameplay or Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is unique to event distributions.
