## Identity & Utility
**Slowbronite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (specifically Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire)** and featured prominently in the Alola region (Generation VII).
* **Description:** A specialized, high-rarity held item that resonates with a Trainer's Key Stone. When held by a Slowbro, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Special Acquisition**). Its value is tied to endgame progression or competitive currency (BP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the transformation of **Slowbro** into **Mega Slowbro** during a battle. This transformation significantly boosts Slowbro's Defense and Special Attack stats and replaces its current ability with **Shell Armor** (which protects it from critical hits).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but the item is consumed/lost for the duration of the battle, preventing Mega Evolution).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Niche/Stall Staple.** Mega Slowbro is utilized as an elite physical wall. While it loses the "Regenerator" ability of its base form, the massive Defense boost and immunity to critical hits from "Shell Armor" make it an immovable tank capable of set-up sweeping with *Calm Mind*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Specific Requirement:** Only functions for **Slowbro**; does not affect Slowking (which lacks a Mega Evolution).
    * **Protection:** As a Mega Stone, this item cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief*, or swapped by *Trick/Switcheroo* if held by the correct Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through endgame side-quests or specialized vendors. In Gen VII (Sun/Moon), it is obtained at the **Battle Tree** for 64 Battle Points (BP). In Gen VI (ORAS), it is given by a man in **Shoal Cave** after providing him with Shoal Salts and Shells.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, singular item usually associated with the lore of "Mega Evolution" and the bond between Trainer and Pokémon.
* **Lore context:** One of the "mysterious stones" scattered across the world, theorized to be the result of ultimate weapon energy or meteorites reacting with the earth.
