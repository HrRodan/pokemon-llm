## Identity & Utility
**Nanab Berry** is a **Baking-only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A pink, banana-shaped fruit used primarily as a culinary ingredient. It is a **Consumable/Plantable** item that can be bought or grown in soft soil. In the Sinnoh region, it is a staple ingredient for making Poffins to improve a Pokémon's Contest performance.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In standard RPG battles, the Nanab Berry has **no direct effect** on HP, status, or stats. Its utility is restricted to planting/harvesting and the creation of **PokéBlocks** and **Poffins**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it acts as a **Water-type** move with a base power of 70 (Gen IV–V) or 90 (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-existent.** It is a "Contest/Utility" item and is never used in serious VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution directly, the Poffins/PokéBlocks made from this berry are essential for raising the **Beauty** condition required to evolve **Feebas into Milotic** in legacy titles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on berry trees throughout the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions. It is often obtainable from the Berry Master or specialized Berry Shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not listed as a standard held item for wild Pokémon (Total held: 0). It is primarily gathered through cultivation or overworld interaction.
* **Lore:** The berry is known for its sweet flavor and is a favorite for making sweets in Sinnoh. Its name and appearance are derived from the banana, reflecting its tropical Hoenn origins. In modern spin-offs like Pokémon GO, it has the unique property of calming erratic wild Pokémon, though this mechanic is absent from the core series JSON data.
