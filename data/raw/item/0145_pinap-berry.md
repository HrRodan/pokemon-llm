## Identity & Utility
**Pinap Berry** is a **Baking-only / Berry** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A sour-sweet fruit primarily used as a raw ingredient for crafting Pokémon treats. In the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions, it is a staple for making Pokéblocks and Poffins to enhance a Pokémon's Contest conditions. It is a **Consumable** item that is **Cheap** and widely accessible.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the core series RPGs, the Pinap Berry has **no direct effect** when held or used in battle. Its utility is strictly relegated to the **Berry Pot/Soil** for planting and the **Blender/Pot** for cooking sweets that boost Contest stats (specifically the "Cool" or "Tough" attributes depending on the game version).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Bug-type** attack with **80 Power** (Gen V+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-existent.** It provides no tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats, as it does not restore HP or provide utility like the Sitrus or Lum Berry.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. However, it interacts with the **Pickup** ability in certain generations and is a required ingredient for high-level Poffin recipes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on soft soil patches throughout the Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Kalos regions. It is often sold at dedicated Berry shops (like the Berry Master's House or the Floral Kids shop). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found held by wild Pokémon in the core series. 
* **Cross-Media Context (World Knowledge):** In **Pokémon GO**, the Pinap Berry has a significantly higher utility, acting as a catch modifier that **doubles the amount of Candy** received if the Pokémon is successfully caught. This makes it a high-priority resource for trainers looking to evolve or power up their roster.
