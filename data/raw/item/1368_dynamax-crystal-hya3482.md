## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (★Hya3482)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, single-use consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Galar. Once activated, the designated Pokémon remains available for battle until the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a internal price value, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is considered a promotional/event item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it generates a red beam that initiates a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. The encounter persists until the player wins or until midnight of the same day.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility/collection item used exclusively in the overworld to facilitate a raid encounter. It has no tactical value in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, Pokémon caught via Dynamax Crystals often possess high individual values (IVs) and have a chance to possess their Hidden Ability, making them valuable for breeding competitive teams.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of special retail promotions or pre-order bonuses for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* (specifically the Dual Pack). Each crystal is tied to a specific Pokémon encounter—typically version exclusives like Larvitar or Jangmo-o—allowing players to catch them regardless of their game version.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or other in-game methods. 
* **Lore Context:** These crystals act as localized "Beacons," drawing a specific Pokémon to a dormant den that would otherwise remain inactive, providing a guaranteed encounter that bypasses the standard random den rotation.
