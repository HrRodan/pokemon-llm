## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (BOO5435)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** An event-exclusive consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It is a **Special Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay channels. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Not for sale**; while the internal data lists a price, it is traditionally distributed via serial codes and cannot be purchased in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), using this item causes a specific Pokémon—traditionally a Gigantamax-capable or version-exclusive Pokémon—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** The item itself has no utility in battle. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing guaranteed access to Pokémon with specific **Hidden Abilities**, high **Individual Values (IVs)**, or the **Gigantamax Factor**, which are otherwise difficult to farm.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon the successful spawning of the raid. It does not evolve Pokémon, but it is the only way to trigger certain encounters outside of standard Den rotations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional bonus. This specific crystal (BOO5435) was typically tied to retail pre-orders (such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack) or special event distributions at retailers like GameStop or the Pokémon Center.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a "gift-only" mechanic designed to facilitate community events or promotional tie-ins.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated masses of Galar particles that can force a "Wishing Star" effect on a specific dormant Power Spot (the Watchtower Lair).
