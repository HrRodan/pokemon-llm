## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1373** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An event-exclusive consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot** be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Special Acquisition). While it has a nominal cost in the game data, it is traditionally obtained via serial codes rather than currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—historically **Gigantamax Sandaconda** for this specific Tau1373 variant—to appear in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles; its sole purpose is to facilitate a Max Raid Battle encounter to catch a Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or the Gigantamax Factor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region. Once the raid is activated, the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily made available as a **special distribution/pre-order bonus** for the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* Expansion Pass or specific retail promotions. It is not available in Pokémon Marts or from standard NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only event key.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals (named after Greek letters like Tau, Epsilon, and Delta) were designed to give players guaranteed access to rare Gigantamax encounters that might otherwise rely on low-percentage spawn rates from Wishing Pieces.
