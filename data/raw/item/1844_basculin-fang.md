## Identity & Utility
**Basculin Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Hostile Pokémon, Basculin. It is a **Consumable Material** used exclusively for crafting within the TM Machine system. It cannot be used as a medicine or held by a Pokémon for any in-battle benefit.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Low Value**). While it can be sold, its primary value lies in its use as a crafting currency for Technical Machines.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a recipe ingredient for crafting TMs at Pokémon Centers. Specifically, it is required to craft moves that align with Basculin's predatory nature, such as **TM110 (Liquidation)** and **TM063 (Psychic Fangs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the "Off-Field" preparation phase, allowing trainers to teach powerful Water-type and biting moves to their team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution for any Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Basculin in the Paldea region or the Kitakami province. It is not available for purchase in Marts; it must be farmed through encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. It is a **guaranteed/probabilistic drop** from wild **Basculin** (including Red-Striped, Blue-Striped, and White-Striped forms) upon their defeat or capture. In the ecosystem, these fangs represent the aggressive and territorial nature of the species.
