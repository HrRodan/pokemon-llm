## Identity & Utility
**X-Speed-3** is a **Miracle Shooter** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized battle-enhancement item used to drastically increase a Pokémon's mobility. Unlike standard inventory items, it is a **Wonder Launcher exclusive**, meaning it cannot be purchased in Poké Marts or used in standard overworld gameplay. It is a **Consumable** item that is "purchased" using points accumulated during a match.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired specifically through the Wonder Launcher point system during multiplayer battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon in battle, it **raises the target’s Speed stat by three stages** (increasing the stat to 250% of its original value). This effect is removed if the Pokémon is withdrawn from battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Extremely Niche.** It is only relevant in Generation V (Black/White/Black 2/White 2) multiplayer battles where the "Wonder Launcher" setting is enabled. It is banned or unavailable in all standard VGC and Smogon competitive formats, as they do not allow the use of items from the Bag.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. Its primary interaction is with the Speed stat, allowing a Pokémon to "outspeed" almost any unboosted opponent immediately.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in the game world or sold by NPCs. It is accessed exclusively through the **Wonder Launcher** (known as the Miracle Shooter in Japanese versions) during wireless or Wi-Fi battles in the Unova region. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. Because it is a system-specific battle item, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or stolen from opponents using Thief or Covet.
