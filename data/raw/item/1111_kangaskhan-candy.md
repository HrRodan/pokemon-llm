## Identity & Utility
**Kangaskhan Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable snack packed with species-specific energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be purchased for a low price, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than standard shops. It is used exclusively to enhance a specific Pokémon's performance.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Kangaskhan**, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a system unique to the *Let's Go* titles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is irrelevant to standard VGC or Smogon formats. It is highly valued within the *Let's Go* "No Restrictions" competitive meta, as it allows a Kangaskhan to reach its maximum stat potential (up to +200 in every stat).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon use and cannot be used on any Pokémon other than Kangaskhan.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Kangaskhan Candy is not typically found in Marts. It is primarily obtained by:
    1. **Catching Kangaskhan:** Successfully capturing wild Kangaskhan often yields species-specific candy.
    2. **Transferring:** Sending caught Kangaskhan to **Professor Oak** will reward the player with this candy.
    3. **Poké Ball Plus:** Taking a Kangaskhan for a "Stroll" in the real world using the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense (cannot be stolen via Thief), but is rather a reward for the capture process itself. Since Kangaskhan is a rare spawn (often appearing in the Rock Tunnel in the *Let's Go* games), farming this candy requires dedicated "Catch Combos."
