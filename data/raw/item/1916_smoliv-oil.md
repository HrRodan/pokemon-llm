## Identity & Utility
**Smoliv Oil** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A byproduct/material shed by the Smoliv evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting resource used at Technical Machine (TM) Machines to create various TMs. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be used directly in battle or overworld for healing.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it has a sell price, its primary value is as a crafting reagent or exchanged for League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines. At a TM Machine, Smoliv Oil is combined with League Points (LP) to create moves such as **TM168 (Solar Beam)** and others associated with Grass-type or oil-based themes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely within the crafting and progression ecosystem of the Paldea region. It has no tactical application in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a drop-item resulting from interactions with the Smoliv line (Smoliv, Dolliv, Arboliva).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Smoliv family. It is most commonly farmed in the **South Province (Area Two)** and **Olive Roll** challenge areas of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense, it is automatically rewarded to the player after encounters with wild **Smoliv**, **Dolliv**, and **Arboliva**. It is a reliable resource for players looking to teach powerful Grass-type moves to their team during a playthrough.
