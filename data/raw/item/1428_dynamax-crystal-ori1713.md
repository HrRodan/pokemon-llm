## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Ori1713)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special, event-exclusive consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (denoted by the internal variable) to appear for a raid. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a internal price value, it is not sold in Poké Marts; the low cost prevents significant profit if sold and serves as a placeholder for a unique acquisition.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair**, a pillar of red light appears, initiating a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. This encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was used. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles; it is strictly an overworld tool for obtaining specific Pokémon or items (like Exp. Candies and TRs) through Max Raid Battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it facilitates the capture of Pokémon that may have Hidden Abilities or the Gigantamax Factor, which are often otherwise difficult to obtain.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** or special promotional events (such as pre-order bonuses or retail distributions). It is a one-time use item; once the crystal is used and the raid is active, the item is removed from the Bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gifted to the player via Mystery Gift or special NPCs associated with event distributions. 
* **Location Context:** The **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area (specifically the Meetup Spot) is the only location where these crystals can be inserted. Using a crystal replaces any existing raid at that specific den.
