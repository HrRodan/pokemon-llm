## Identity & Utility
**Crystal-cluster** is an **Event Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** It is a specialized quest or progression item associated with the Terarium and the unique geological properties of the Blueberry Academy. It is a **Key/Event Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through specific events or gameplay progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the context of Generation IX, these clusters are linked to the **Stellar Tera Type** and the energy found within the Terarium of Blueberry Academy. They typically serve as a currency or a requirement for the **Synchro Machine** or for unlocking specific environmental upgrades via the **League Club Room** computer.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility/story-driven item used exclusively in the overworld and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Blueberry Points (BP)** system and the Terarium’s ecological development quests.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquired specifically within the **Blueberry Academy** during the events of *The Indigo Disk* DLC. It is often rewarded for completing Blueberry Quests (BBQs) or found as part of the "Stellar" phenomenon investigations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique inventory object granted by NPCs or environmental interactions within the Terarium's specialized biomes.
* **Lore context:** These clusters represent condensed Terastal energy. Unlike standard Tera Shards, Crystal Clusters are significant geological formations used by researchers at the Academy to study the "Stellar" type and the expansion of the Terastal phenomenon outside of the Paldea region.
