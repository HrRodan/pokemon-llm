## Identity & Utility
**Poison Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A high-tech memory disc containing specialized Poison-type data. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for use by the Synthesis Pokémon, **Silvally**. While it has a listed cost, it is typically treated as a unique tactical component rather than a standard consumable.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though typically acquired as part of a complete set through story events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with the **RKS System** ability (exclusively **Silvally**), the holder’s type changes to **Poison**. Additionally, the holder's signature move, **Multi-Attack**, becomes a Poison-type physical attack.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Base damage; no additional secondary effects when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Situational.** Silvally-Poison acts as a bulky pivot or a Fairy-type check in lower Smogon tiers (like NU or PU). Its primary value lies in its immunity to the Poison status and its ability to remove **Toxic Spikes** upon switching in. However, it is often bypassed in favor of the Steel or Fairy Memories, which offer superior defensive utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **RKS System:** This item is inert if held by any Pokémon other than Silvally.
    * **Klutz/Magic Room:** If the holder's ability is suppressed or Magic Room is active, Silvally reverts to its base Normal typing and Multi-Attack returns to Normal type.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as part of a collection. In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the set of memories is gifted to the player by **Gladion** at Aether Paradise. In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, they are provided by an NPC in the Battle Tower after the player receives Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a synthetic creation intended for the "Beast Killer" project (Type: Full/Silvally).
* **Context:** It represents one of the 17 elemental drives created to allow Silvally to adapt to any combat scenario, mimicking the biological versatility of Arceus.
