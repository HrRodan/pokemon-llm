## Identity & Utility
**Rock Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious crystalline shard crackling with Rock-type energy. It is a **Consumable Material** used specifically to alter the Terastal properties of a Pokémon. While it can be sold at shops, its primary value is as a specialized currency for technical team adjustments.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Standard/Accessible; however, its utility value far exceeds its sell price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Rock Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon's Tera Type to **Rock**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta-Utility.** While the Rock type has several defensive weaknesses, it is used strategically in competitive play (VGC/Smogon) to grant a Pokémon a 1.5x Special Defense boost under **Sandstorm**. It is also used offensively by attackers to gain STAB on powerful moves like *Rock Slide* or *Stone Edge* to check Fire, Flying, or Ice-type threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic. It is frequently farmed by players looking to optimize their competitive rosters for specific regional or global tournaments.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for defeating or catching Pokémon in **Rock-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star or higher). They can also be found as sparkling dropped items throughout the Paldea region, particularly in rocky or mountainous terrain, and can be produced via the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is tied strictly to raid completion, overworld exploration, and specific quest rewards (such as those from Professor Jacq or the Ogre Oustin' mini-game).
