## Identity & Utility
**Roto Exp. Points** is a **Rotom Power** (special consumable) introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** It is a specialized power-up granted by the Rotom Pokédex. When activated, it boosts the amount of Experience Points the player's Pokémon earn after winning battles for a limited duration. It is a **Consumable** utility item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation from the "Rotom Powers" pocket, it increases the Experience Points gained by the party after battle by **1.5x**. This effect typically lasts for 10 minutes of active gameplay.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly restricted to the single-player campaign and cannot be used in VGC, Smogon, or any online multiplayer formats. It is designed purely to accelerate leveling during a playthrough or while grinding for the post-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a manifestation of the "Roto Loto" mechanic, representing the bond between the trainer and the Rotom Pokédex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is exclusively obtained through the **Roto Loto** mini-game in Alola. The player must interact with the Rotom Pokédex on the lower screen when its eyes flash gold; the "Loto" then randomly awards a set of Rotom Powers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is generated solely through the digital interface of the Rotom Dex. In the context of Alolan lore, it represents Rotom using its electrical energy to optimize the training feedback for the player's team.
