## Identity & Utility
**Power Herb** is a Competitive Held Item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A single-use consumable that allows the holder to bypass the "charge-up" turn of powerful multi-turn attacks. It is a **Held Item** that can be purchased, though it is frequently associated with post-game Battle Facilities.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard; often sold for Battle Points (BP) in various regions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder initiates a move that normally requires a turn to charge (such as Solar Beam, Meteor Beam, or Geomancy), the item is consumed, and the move executes immediately on the first turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** It is most famously used by Xerneas to trigger *Geomancy* in a single turn, providing a massive +2 boost to Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. It is also used by Pokémon with *Meteor Beam* to get an immediate Special Attack boost and high-damage Rock-type hit, or on physical attackers using *Sky Attack* or *Solar Blade*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the White Herb, which triggers on stat drops, the Power Herb only triggers on specific charge-up move animations. Moves like *Skull Bash* will still grant their Defense boost before the Power Herb is consumed and the attack lands.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as a reward in Battle Frontier, Battle Maison, or Battle Tree facilities. In modern titles, it is often available in high-end shops like Delibird Presents or late-game Pokémon Centers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is found in the wild on the **Seedot**, **Nuzleaf**, and **Shiftry** evolutionary line. Players can farm these items using moves like **Thief** or the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets.
