## Identity & Utility
**RM-4-Key (Room 4 Key)** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An old, fragile-looking key specifically designed to unlock the door to Room 4 within the Abandoned Ship (known as Sea Mauville in later iterations). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Unlocks the door to Room 4 on the Abandoned Ship. This allows the player to access specific loot, progress the exploration of the vessel, and find subsequent keys required for the area's side quest.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) and exists solely for overworld progression and puzzle-solving within the Hoenn region's storyline.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is purely a mechanical trigger for a specific door interaction.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the **Abandoned Ship** (Route 108) in the original Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald versions. It is typically found as a hidden item or inside a trash can/container within one of the other rooms, forming a "scavenger hunt" progression loop (finding the key for Room 1 to get to Room 2, and so on).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique plot item gathered through exploration.
* **World Context:** The flavor text describes it as "old and looks easily broken," emphasizing the dilapidated state of the Abandoned Ship. In the Generation VI remakes (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire), this questline was reimagined within **Sea Mauville**, though the mechanic of using numbered keys to navigate the facility remained consistent.
