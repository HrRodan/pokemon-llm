## Identity & Utility
**Combee Honey** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Combee evolutionary line. Unlike the traditional "Honey" item used for attracting wild Pokémon, this is a distinct resource used exclusively at the TM Machine in the Paldea region. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold but is primarily intended for utility.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value is its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use as a reagent for TMs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a specific component required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine. It is notably used for Bug-type moves, such as **TM021 (Pounce)** and **TM162 (Bug Buzz)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle; it resides in the TM Materials pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be used or held during a match. Its utility is strictly limited to the game's crafting economy and move-pool expansion during a playthrough.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the Combee line and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the Paldea region. It is obtained by defeating or catching wild **Combee** or **Vespiquen**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a **guaranteed drop** upon the defeat or capture of the Combee evolutionary line. 
* **Niche Role:** While the name is similar to the "Honey" item from Gen IV, Combee Honey serves as a modern representation of the "biological materials" system used to standardize TM acquisition in the ninth generation, moving away from the "infinite-use" or "one-time-use" shop-based TMs of previous eras.
