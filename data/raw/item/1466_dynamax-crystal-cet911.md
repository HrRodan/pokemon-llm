## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CET911)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable** item that is **not for sale** in standard shops, despite its nominal internal cost. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition; typically distributed via serial codes or promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—determined by the crystal's ID—to appear as a Max Raid boss. This raid persists until the end of the calendar day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for facilitating encounters. However, these crystals were historically significant for granting early access to version-exclusive Pokémon (such as Larvitar or Jangmo-o) or specific Gigantamax-capable species for competitive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the activation of the Max Raid den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are **Event-Exclusive** items. They were primarily distributed through promotional serial codes via retailers (like GameStop, Target, or GAME) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* Dual Pack. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital distribution item that cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief. 
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique, otherwise empty den in the Wild Area. These crystals "activate" the dormant energy within the tower to summon rare Pokémon that wouldn't naturally appear in that location.
