## Identity & Utility
**Good Rod** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (refined in Generation III).
* **Description:** A mid-tier fishing tool designed for angling in various bodies of water. It serves as the bridge between the rudimentary Old Rod and the professional-grade Super Rod. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used near water tiles, it initiates a fishing encounter. It accesses the "Good Rod" encounter table for a specific map, which typically yields mid-level aquatic Pokémon (often ranging from levels 10 to 30).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is purely for world exploration and Pokémon collection. In **Nuzlocke challenges**, it is a vital tool for "guaranteeing" encounters in water-heavy routes where the Old Rod's pool is too limited.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is the primary method for obtaining mid-stage aquatic Pokémon like **Poliwag**, **Goldeen**, and **Krabby** in earlier generations before the Super Rod is accessible.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually gifted by NPCs known as "Fishing Gurus" or their family members. Historically, it is found in locations such as **Fuchsia City** (Kanto), **Route 118** (Hoenn), or **Olivine City** (Johto).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is unique and cannot be found on wild Pokémon. It resides in the Key Items pocket of the Trainer's bag and is traditionally assigned to a "Registered" shortcut for ease of use while surfing or standing near shorelines.
