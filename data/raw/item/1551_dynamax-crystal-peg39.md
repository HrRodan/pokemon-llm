## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PEG39** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A consumable, star-shaped crystal that, when thrown into the empty den at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that remains active only until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal Cost**; technically not purchasable through standard Marts, this value is a placeholder for game logic).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon use at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to appear in a Max Raid Battle. Once the crystal is consumed, the beam remains active until the player either defeats the Pokémon or the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld encounters and has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. It is used to secure specific Pokémon that may have Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax potential.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (PEG39) is part of a series of event-only items. While the flavor text uses a variable, PEG39 is historically associated with promotional distributions (such as the **Gigantamax Corviknight** encounter).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Distribution Only.** Dynamax Crystals are typically obtained via serial codes provided through retail pre-orders (such as the Dual Pack), movie ticket sales, or hobby magazines (like CoroCoro). They cannot be found during regular gameplay or purchased from NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a strictly digital distribution item intended to bridge the gap between physical retail promotions and in-game raid mechanics.
* **Context:** These items were the primary method for Game Freak to provide "on-demand" Raids for rare Gigantamax forms before they were made common through Max Raid Events.
