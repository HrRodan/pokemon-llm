## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (TRI544)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to force a specific Max Raid Battle encounter at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal variable data) will inhabit the lair until midnight of the same day. It is an event-exclusive item that cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon for competitive benefit.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal price in the data, it is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained via serial codes or special distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area while holding this crystal, it activates a pillar of light, initiating a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. The crystal is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression/collection item used strictly in the overworld to facilitate encounters. It has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "key-style" consumable that interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed through promotional events, pre-order bonuses, or retail partnerships (such as those with GameStop or Pokémon Center). These crystals allowed players early or guaranteed access to specific Pokémon, such as Gigantamax forms or version-exclusives, regardless of their current progress in the Wild Area's natural raid rotation.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**.
* **Lore Context:** In the context of Galar's power spots, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated masses of Galar particles that can artificially stimulate a Pokémon Den, bypassing the usual cooldowns or random nature of Wishing Pieces.
