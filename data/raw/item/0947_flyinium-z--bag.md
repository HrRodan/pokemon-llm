## Identity & Utility
**Flyinium Z (Bag Item)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item represents the stored version of the Flying-type Z-Crystal within the player's Bag. It serves as the source of Z-Power required to upgrade Flying-type moves into powerful **Z-Moves**. Unlike standard held items, this "bag" version is a permanent Key Item-style object that allows the player to assign the crystal to any number of compatible Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique progression item obtained through gameplay.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with at least one **Flying-type move**, it allows the use of the Z-Move: **Supersonic Skystrike**. 
    * If the base move is an **attacking move**, the power of Supersonic Skystrike scales based on the original move's power (e.g., a Z-Move based on *Brave Bird* will have 190 Base Power).
    * If the base move is a **status move**, it creates a **Z-Status Move**, granting a secondary effect (e.g., *Z-Mirror Move* boosts Attack by 2 stages, while *Z-Tailwind* increases Critical Hit ratio).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Gen VII Specialist).** Flyinium Z was a staple in Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Moon competitive play. It was frequently used by Pokémon like **Landorus-Therian**, **Gyarados**, and **Celesteela** to bypass traditional counters with a high-damage nuke that ignores effects like *Protect* (partially) and does not trigger contact-based abilities/items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is essential for activating Z-Move mechanics. It is ignored by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* and cannot be removed or traded while held by a Pokémon in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the Flyinium Z is typically found in **Ten Carat Hill** on Melemele Island. It is often guarded by a powerful Totem-like encounter or located in a pedestal area (Farthest Hollow).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is a one-time acquisition provided through the Alolan Island Challenge lore.
* **World Knowledge:** Z-Crystals represent the bond between Trainer and Pokémon, focusing the natural energy of the Alola region. The Flyinium Z specifically embodies the "Spirit of the Sky."
