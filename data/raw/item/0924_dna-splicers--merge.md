## Identity & Utility
**DNA Splicers (Merge)** is a **Key Item** (functionally categorized here as a transformation state) introduced in **Generation V** (and specifically indexed in this form in **Generation VII**).
* **Description:** A high-tech, mystical device used to fuse the Legendary Pokémon **Kyurem** with either **Reshiram** or **Zekrom**. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed or sold, representing the "Merge" state of the device.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique artifact typically obtained through story progression or post-game exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a Kyurem while Reshiram or Zekrom is also in the party, it fuses the two into **White Kyurem** (with Reshiram) or **Black Kyurem** (with Zekrom). This process consumes the second dragon into the Kyurem entity, freeing up a party slot.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself isn't "held" in battle, it is the **gatekeeper for two of the most powerful Pokémon in the franchise**. White Kyurem and Black Kyurem are consistent staples in the **Ubers tier** and **Restricted Legendary VGC formats** due to their massive base stat totals (700) and Teravolt/Turboblaze abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item facilitates **Abscission Fusion**. To reverse the process, the item must be used again (switching to its "Splicers — Split" state) to separate the dragons. It only works if the player has an empty slot in their party for the returning dragon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In its debut (**Black 2/White 2**), it is found in the **Giant Chasm** after defeating Ghetsis and catching Kyurem.
    * In **Generation VII (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon)**, it is obtained at the **Aether Base** in Alola after the player has captured Kyurem in the Ultra Warp Ride.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a one-of-a-kind device tied to the lore of the "Original Dragon" of the Unova region.
* **Lore:** The Splicers are said to be the physical manifestation of the bond that once held the "Original Dragon" together before it split into Kyurem, Reshiram, and Zekrom. Utilizing the Splicers allows a partial restoration of that ancient, singular being.
