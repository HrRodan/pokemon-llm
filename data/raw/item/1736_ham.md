## Identity & Utility
**Ham** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A sliced, cured meat used specifically within the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable crafting component that cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle or used as a traditional medicine.
* **Cost:** 170 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Ham contributes to the internal "Meal Power" calculation. In the Paldean culinary system, Ham provides a high **Salty** flavor profile and moderate **Savory** notes. It is a core component in recipes like the "Ham Sandwich," which typically grants **Incredible Title Power**, **Encounter Power**, and **Catching Power** (often for Ground types, depending on other ingredients).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect Utility).** While it offers no tactical advantage during a battle, it is vital for competitive players to trigger **Egg Power** (for faster breeding) or **Encounter Power** (for targeting specific Pokémon for IV/EV training).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with abilities like Pickup. It is purely an overworld utility item for the Picnic system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized food retailers throughout the Paldea region. It can be purchased in bulk from **Deli Cioso**, **Sure Cans**, and **Aguila's Supermarket** in major hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, Ham is a processed human food item acquired exclusively through commerce or exploration.
