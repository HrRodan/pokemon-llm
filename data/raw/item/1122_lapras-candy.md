## Identity & Utility
**Lapras Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized, energy-dense nutrient tailored specifically for the Lapras species. It is a **Consumable Stat-Enhancer** that can be bought or sold, though it is primarily obtained through gameplay loops rather than traditional Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Its low cost reflects its nature as a high-volume consumable used to maximize a Pokémon's potential.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Lapras**, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move Fling does not exist in the titles where this item is present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is used to build **AVs (Awakening Values)**. In the context of *Let's Go* competitive play, it is essential for reaching the +200 cap in every stat, making a "Candy-maxed" Lapras significantly more powerful than one without such training. It has no effect in traditional core-series RPGs (Gen 1-9) or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly limited to the **Lapras** evolutionary line (which, as a single-stage Pokémon, means it only functions on Lapras itself).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not typically available in standard Poke Marts. It is primarily earned by:
    * **Transferring:** Sending caught Lapras to Professor Oak.
    * **Catching:** Catching wild Lapras (higher chances with Catch Combos).
    * **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking with a Lapras stored in the physical Poké Ball Plus accessory.
    * **Mini-Games:** Rewards from the Playroom or specific interactions in the GO Park.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is "dropped" as a reward for successful captures, rewarding trainers who specialize in catching this specific species. Overworld Lapras are rare spawns (usually in Seafoam Islands or Route 19/20), making this candy harder to farm than common species candies like Pidgey or Rattata Candy.
