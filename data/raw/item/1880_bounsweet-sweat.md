## Identity & Utility
**Bounsweet Sweat** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A craftable resource dropped by members of the Bounsweet evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** stored in the dedicated "TM Materials" pocket of the bag. It is specifically used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting component for Technical Machines.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) in Paldea. When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to synthesize permanent move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no direct impact on battle stats, abilities, or move execution. Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle preparation phase (move acquisition).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a direct byproduct of the **Bounsweet, Steenee, and Tsareena** evolutionary line. It does not interact with battle-relevant abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching wild members of the Bounsweet line. It is a common drop in the grassy biomes of the Paldea region where these Pokémon reside.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense (like a Leftovers or Berry). Instead, it is automatically awarded to the player's inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter with wild **Bounsweet**, **Steenee**, or **Tsareena**. It is most efficiently farmed by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where Bounsweet are plentiful, such as East Province (Area One) or South Province (Area One).
