## Identity & Utility
**Member Card** is an **Event-Item (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious pass required to enter the locked Harbor Inn in Canalave City. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**. Its flavor text provides a haunting lore hint, noting that the last date marked on the card was 50 years ago, suggesting a ghostly or temporal anomaly.
* **Cost:** **0 Poké Dollars** (Not for sale; Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Member Card serves as the trigger for the **Darkrai event**. Once the player has the National Pokédex and has helped heal Eldritch's son (the Lunar Wing quest), possessing this card allows them to enter the Harbor Inn in Canalave City. Sleeping in the bed there triggers a nightmare that transports the player to **Newmoon Island**, where the Mythical Pokémon **Darkrai** can be battled and caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is the legitimate method for obtaining **Darkrai**, a high-tier Mythical Pokémon historically dominant in "Uber" formats due to its *Bad Dreams* ability and *Dark Void* move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions exclusively as a "flag" in the game's code to unlock a specific map interaction in Canalave City.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a restricted **Event Item**. In the original Generation IV games (*Pokémon Platinum*), it was distributed via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. In the Generation VIII remakes (*Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl*), it was a limited-time Mystery Gift distribution. It is not available through standard NPC shops or overworld exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via a Deliveryman in a Pokémon Center after receiving the Mystery Gift.
* **Context:** The item is intrinsically linked to the "Lunar Duo" lore (Cresselia and Darkrai), representing the darker half of the dream world. Without this item, the Harbor Inn remains permanently locked, leaving Darkrai inaccessible through normal means.
