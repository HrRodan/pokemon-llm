## Identity & Utility
**Colress-machine** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V** (specifically *Pokémon Black 2 and White 2*).
* **Description:** Described as a special device designed to wring out the maximum potential of Pokémon, though it is technically an imperfect prototype. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be consumed, sold, or given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; unique story acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its primary mechanical function is to wake up and provoke the **Crustle** that are blocking various pathways in the Unova region, most notably the one obstructing the exit of **Seaside Cave** leading to Route 21. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive battling or VGC/Smogon formats; its purpose is strictly limited to the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It functions as a "roadblock clearer," similar to the Poké Flute or SquirtBottle in previous generations. It interacts specifically with static overworld encounters of Crustle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The player receives this item from the researcher **Colress** on **Route 22** after discussing his desire to see the true strength of Pokémon. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of technology developed by Colress to test his theories regarding Pokémon empowerment and cannot be farmed or obtained through the **Pickup** ability.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the *Black 2 and White 2* narrative, the Colress Machine represents Colress's scientific obsession with bringing out the hidden power of Pokémon, a theme that ties into his temporary alliance with Team Plasma. After using it to clear the Crustle at Seaside Cave, the player retains it, though its functional use concludes after the Crustle encounters are resolved.
