## Identity & Utility
**Tropius Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Fruit Pokémon, Tropius. It is a specialized crafting resource used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create TMs. It is a **Consumable/Crafting** item that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts but can be sold for League Points (LP) or money.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Tradeable). In the context of the Paldean economy, this value represents its worth when converted to LP or sold to vendors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a necessary ingredient for crafting specific TMs. In Pokémon Scarlet & Violet, it is specifically required to craft high-powered Grass-type moves such as **TM155 (Frenzy Plant)**, **TM159 (Leaf Storm)**, and **TM168 (Solar Beam)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials generally cannot be held by Pokémon and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the crafting and progression ecosystem of the Paldea region and has no direct utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency/component for the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Tropius**. It is a common drop found in areas where Tropius resides, such as the Casseroya Lake and West Province (Area Three) in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" that provides a benefit during combat, it is guaranteed or highly likely to be dropped by wild **Tropius** upon their defeat. It is typically gathered in bulk for players looking to teach powerful Grass-type coverage moves to their team.
