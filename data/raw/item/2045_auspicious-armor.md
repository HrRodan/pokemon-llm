## Identity & Utility
**Auspicious Armor** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet)**.
*   **Description:** A peculiar set of armor that radiates auspicious energy. It is a single-use consumable item used to trigger the evolution of a specific Pokémon. Despite being categorized under "picnic" in some data structures, its functional role is strictly an evolution catalyst.
*   **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (Moderate value; though primarily acquired through material exchange rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a **Charcadet**, it causes the Pokémon to evolve into **Armarouge**, a Fire/Psychic-type Pokémon.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is essential for obtaining **Armarouge**. Armarouge is a highly relevant competitive Pokémon in VGC (Double Battles), known for its signature move "Armor Cannon," the "Weakness Policy + Weak Armor" strategy, and its synergy with Indeedee-F in Psychic Terrain.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a version-exclusive evolution item. It serves as the counterpart to the **Malicious Armor** (which evolves Charcadet into Ceruledge in Pokémon Violet).

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** In Pokémon Scarlet, it is obtained in **Zapapico** by speaking to an NPC who requests **10 Bronzor Fragments** in exchange for the armor. These fragments are dropped by wild Bronzor.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not found held by wild Pokémon. It must be crafted/traded for via the Bronzor Fragment exchange mechanic. It is generally unavailable in Pokémon Violet except through trading the item or the evolved Pokémon from Scarlet.
