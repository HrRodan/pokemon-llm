## Identity & Utility
**Silver Powder** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation II** (and featured prominently since Generation III).
* **Description:** A shiny, silver powder that enhances the natural capabilities of insectoid Pokémon. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that can be bought and sold. It serves as the thematic counterpart to items like Charcoal or Mystic Water, specifically tailored for the Bug type.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the holder's **Bug-type moves by 20%** (1.2× multiplier). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered a **niche item**. In high-level competitive play (Smogon/VGC), it is typically outclassed by **Life Orb** (which boosts all moves by 30% at the cost of HP) or **Choice Band/Specs**. However, it is valuable in specific scenarios where the player wants to boost Bug-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves like *U-turn*, *Bug Buzz*, or *First Impression* without receiving recoil damage or being locked into a single move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a power-boosting tool. It interacts positively with Pokémon possessing high-damage Bug moves, such as Volcarona or Pheromosa, though it is often a secondary choice behind more versatile items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in the overworld near forests or areas with dense vegetation. In many titles, it can be purchased at specialized shops or the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree for BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Silver Powder is frequently found on wild Bug-type Pokémon. It can be farmed from:
    * **Butterfree, Venomoth, Beautifly, Dustox, Masquerain, Mothim, and Volcarona.**
    * It is also held by all forms of **Wormadam** (Plant, Sandy, and Trash cloaks). 
    * Trainers often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase held item rates) and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to harvest this item from these wild species.
