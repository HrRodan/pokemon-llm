## Identity & Utility
**Quick Claw** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation II** (represented here in its Generation III data context).
* **Description:** A light, sharp claw that, when held by a Pokémon, grants a chance to strike first regardless of the user's Speed stat. It is a **Held-Active** item that is **Consumable only via Fling**; otherwise, it remains with the holder throughout the battle.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range cost**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Whenever the holder selects a move, there is a **3/16 (18.75%) chance** that the Pokémon will act first within its priority bracket. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output for a non-specialized Fling item).
    * **Priority Interaction:** This effect only applies to moves within the same priority bracket. It will not allow a priority 0 move (like Tackle) to outspeed a priority +1 move (like Quick Attack).
    * **Trick Room:** If the Quick Claw activates while **Trick Room** is in effect, the holder will move first, effectively ignoring the Speed-reversal dimensions of the field for that turn.
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche/High-Variance**. In serious competitive play (Smogon), it is often discouraged or subject to "Item Clause" because it introduces significant RNG. However, it is a **staple for slow, powerful attackers** in casual playthroughs or Nuzlocke challenges (e.g., Torkoal or Snorlax) to mitigate their Speed disadvantage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in mid-game shops or given by NPCs who appreciate "sharp" or "quick" Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is naturally occurring in the wild and can be farmed from Pokémon known for their claws. It is held by:
    * **Sandshrew / Sandslash**
    * **Meowth / Persian** (including Alolan variants)
    * **Sneasel / Weavile**
    * **Zangoose**
* **Farming Tip:** Players can use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability to identify the item and **Covet** or **Thief** to steal it from these wild encounters.
