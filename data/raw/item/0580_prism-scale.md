## Identity & Utility
**Prism Scale** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, rainbow-colored scale that radiates a multi-colored shimmer. It is a specialized **Consumable Held Item** used specifically to trigger the metamorphosis of a particular Pokémon. While it has a defined internal cost, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts and is typically treated as a rare find or treasure.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderate value, though usually acquired through exploration rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Feebas** during a trade between trainers, the Prism Scale is consumed, and the Feebas evolves into **Milotic**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no competitive utility** in battle. Its sole purpose is facilitating evolution. Milotic, the result of this evolution, is a highly relevant competitive bulky Water-type, making the Prism Scale a critical "gatekeeper" item for VGC and Smogon players.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item was specifically created as a mechanical alternative to the "Beauty" stat requirement from previous generations. It is the primary method for obtaining Milotic in games where the Pokémon Contest mechanics (specifically Poffins or Pokéblocks) are absent.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specific overworld locations related to water, such as **Route 1** in Unova, **Couriway Town** in Kalos, or via the **Cram-o-matic** in Galar. It is often hidden or found in rippling water spots.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon according to standard data. In some games, it can be repeatedly acquired through the **Pickup** ability (typically by high-level Pokémon) or by fishing in specific "special" spots.
* **Lore Context:** The Prism Scale is often associated with the immense beauty of Milotic, mirroring the "Heart Scale" in aesthetic but serving a transformative rather than commemorative purpose.
