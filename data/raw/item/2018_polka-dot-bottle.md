## Identity & Utility
**Polka-dot Bottle** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's picnic setup. It serves as a visual enhancement for the picnic table during the sandwich-making and Pokémon interaction mini-games. It is a **consumable-adjacent cosmetic item** (once purchased, it remains in the Picnic inventory) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, they can customize their table's appearance. The Polka-dot Bottle changes the visual style of the condiments/bottles present on the table to match the polka-dot aesthetic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on stats, typing, or moves. It is strictly for the overworld Picnic mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is part of the "Picnic Knacks" collection used specifically in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Picnic Knacks** specialty stores located in major Paldean cities such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is an enthusiast's item obtained through retail purchase rather than foraging or battling.
* **Context:** In the Paldean culture of "treasure hunting," picnicking is a central social activity. Items like the Polka-dot Bottle allow trainers to express individual style while bonding with their team and crafting sandwiches to gain Meal Powers.
