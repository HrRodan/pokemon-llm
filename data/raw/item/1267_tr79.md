## Identity & Utility
**TR79 (Heavy Slam)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item. It teaches the move **Heavy Slam**, a Steel-type physical attack where the user slams its body into the target. It is a **Consumable** machine that, unlike the TMs of its generation, breaks after a single use.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive). In the context of Generation VIII, this is often converted to **3,000-5,000 Watts** when purchased from Wild Area traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Heavy Slam**. The move's power is dynamic, scaling based on how much the user outweighs the target:
    * **120 BP:** Target weight is 20% or less of user's weight.
    * **100 BP:** Target weight is 20.01%–25% of user's weight.
    * **80 BP:** Target weight is 25.01%–33.33% of user's weight.
    * **60 BP:** Target weight is 33.34%–50% of user's weight.
    * **40 BP:** Target weight is over 50% of user's weight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; generally not used for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A staple for heavy Steel-type physical attackers like **Copperajah**, **Steelix**, **Aggron**, and **Melmetal**. It is particularly effective against light-weight Fairy-types (e.g., Whimsicott, Mimikyu, Clefable), often dealing maximum base power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. The move's effectiveness is directly influenced by the **Heavy Metal** (doubles weight) and **Light Metal** (halves weight) abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR79 is primarily obtained by defeating Steel-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area. The stock of Watt Traders rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured record of technical data. In the Galar region's lore, TRs represent "one-time use" knowledge that was more common in older generations but revived for high-tier moves in Galar.
