## Identity & Utility
**Golden Nanab Berry** is a **Catching-bonus Berry** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A rare, high-tier variant of the standard Nanab Berry. It is a **Consumable** item used during wild encounters to drastically pacify a Pokémon, making it much easier to aim and land Poké Ball throws. Unlike standard berries that provide minor stability, the Golden variant is designed for high-difficulty captures.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). Its high price point reflects its status as a late-game utility item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a wild Pokémon during the capture phase, it **drastically reduces erratic movement**. It stops the Pokémon from jumping, flying, or attacking the screen, effectively locking it into a neutral position for a set duration. This is the most potent version of the "calm" effect available in the *Let's Go* engine.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible). 
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly a "Field/Catching Utility" item. It does not exist in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held by Pokémon in traditional battle-focused RPG entries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any known evolutions. It is functionally distinct from the standard Nanab Berry found in Generation III-VIII, as it belongs to a specific subset of "Golden" catching items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee*, these berries are primarily found as **hidden recurring items** in high-level areas like **Cerulean Cave**. They are also frequently rewarded for maintaining high **Catch Combos** or successfully completing high-difficulty raids in *Pokémon GO* (where they serve a similar role of significantly calming the Pokémon and increasing catch rates).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is typically gathered via exploration or as a reward for skilled gameplay rather than through the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
