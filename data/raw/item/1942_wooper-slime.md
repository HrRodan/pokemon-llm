## Identity & Utility
**Wooper Slime** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed by members of the Wooper evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** used specifically at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create TMs. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for an effect.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard crafting material value; often exchanged for League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a non-volatile resource for the **TM Machine**. When combined with League Points (LP) and other specific materials, it is consumed to craft Technical Machines.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is entirely **pre-battle/logistical**, as it is required to teach Pokémon moves that may be vital for competitive sets (e.g., moves like *Earthquake* or *Mud-Shot* depending on the TM recipe).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a drop item specifically linked to the biological presence of the Wooper species in the overworld.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the **Paldea region** and other Gen IX locales. It is acquired as a drop after defeating or catching wild Wooper or its evolutions.
* **Wild Drop Source:** Dropped by wild **Paldean Wooper**, **Johtonian Wooper**, and **Clodsire**. This is most efficiently gathered using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where these Pokémon congregate, such as marshes, ponds, and the South Province.
