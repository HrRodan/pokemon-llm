## Identity & Utility
**Green Scarf** is a **Scarf (Contest Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn Region).
* **Description:** An accessory to be held by a Pokémon to enhance its performance in Pokémon Contests. It specifically targets the **Smart** (or Clever) condition. It is a **Held Item** that, while technically assigned a low cost, is primarily obtained through special NPC interactions rather than standard retail.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon entering a Pokémon Contest or Super Contest, it increases the holder’s **Smartness** during the Visual Competition (the introductory round). This boost allows the Pokémon to earn more points/hearts from the audience based on its appearance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no mechanical impact on standard VGC or Smogon battles. It is a niche utility item dedicated exclusively to the Contest sub-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a five-item set (Red, Blue, Pink, Green, Yellow Scarves) each corresponding to one of the five Contest conditions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired from the **Pokémon Fan Club Chairman** (found in Slateport City in Hoenn or Hearthome City in Sinnoh). To receive the Green Scarf, the player must show the Chairman a Pokémon that has a nearly maximized **Smart** condition (achieved by feeding it Green Pokéblocks or Bitter Poffins).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique reward for trainers who focus on the "Clever" aspect of Pokémon raising. It is a staple for players attempting to win the **Master Rank Smart Contest** and earn the corresponding Ribbon.
