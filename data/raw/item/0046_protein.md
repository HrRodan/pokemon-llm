## Identity & Utility
**Protein** is a **Vitamin (Medicine)** introduced in **Generation I** (metadata indicates persistent availability through Generation IV and beyond).
* **Description:** A nutritious drink for Pokémon that enhances physical performance. It is a **Consumable** item usable in the overworld and during battle (though battle use is primarily for friendship gain). It is a high-tier training supplement and a staple for competitive preparation.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price reflects its utility in bypassing manual effort training.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, Protein increases a Pokémon's **Attack Effort Values (EVs)** by **10 points**. 
    * *Mechanical Limitation:* In older generations (as noted in the data), it cannot be used if the Pokémon has already accumulated 100 Attack EVs. In modern iterations (Gen VIII+), this cap is removed, allowing Protein to fully max out Attack EVs to 252.
* **Secondary Mechanics:**
    * **Friendship:** Increases a Pokémon's happiness/friendship by 5, 3, or 2 points depending on the current friendship tier.
    * **Battle Attributes:**
        * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Tool.** Used by trainers to quickly optimize "Physical Sweepers" or "Wallbreakers" (e.g., Garchomp, Zacian) without the need for grinding against wild Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is an efficient way to increase friendship for Pokémon that evolve via the high-friendship mechanic (e.g., Lucario, Crobat) while simultaneously boosting their stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, Lilycove City) or purchasable with BP (Battle Points) in end-game facilities like the **Battle Tower** or **Battle Tree**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through retail purchase or as a rare find in the overworld (hidden items/Itemballs).
* **Lore context:** Categorized as a "nutritious drink," it represents the intersection of sports science and Pokémon training, often associated with gyms and high-level training regimens.
