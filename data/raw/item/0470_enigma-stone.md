## Identity & Utility
**Enigma Stone** is an **Event-exclusive Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** Described as a beautiful, rock-encrusted crystal ball excavated from the earth. It is a specialized quest item that cannot be bought or sold. As a "Key Item" type (categorized under event-items), it is used to trigger a specific legendary encounter and cannot be held by Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through special distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the **Pewter Museum of Science** in the Kanto region, the stone is examined by researchers and Steven Stone. It is revealed to be the "Soul Dew." This triggers an immediate encounter with a legendary Pokémon outside the museum.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a **Lore/Story Item** used exclusively for catching legendary Pokémon in the post-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The specific Pokémon summoned depends on the game version:
    * **HeartGold:** Summons **Latias**.
    * **SoulSilver:** Summons **Latios**.
    * *Context:* This allows the player to obtain the member of the Eon Duo that is not already roaming the wild in their specific version.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally distributed via a limited-time **Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection** event in 2010. In the current era, it is generally unobtainable without the use of DNS exploits or save editing.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact associated with the lore of the Eon Duo (Latios and Latias) and their connection to the Soul Dew.
* **World Knowledge:** While the JSON refers to it as the "Enigma Stone," its true identity within the game's narrative is a dormant **Soul Dew**, an item that traditionally boosts the Special Attack and Special Defense of Latias and Latios when held. Upon completing the event, the Enigma Stone is effectively replaced by the encounter and the subsequent acquisition of the actual Soul Dew held item.
