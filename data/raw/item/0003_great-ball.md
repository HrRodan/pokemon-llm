## Identity & Utility
**Great-ball** is a **Standard Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation I** (listed in this record under Generation III context).
* **Description:** A high-performance Poké Ball that provides a significantly higher success rate for catching wild Pokémon than a standard Poké Ball. It is a **Consumable** item used specifically for capturing untamed Pokémon; it cannot be used to steal Pokémon from other trainers.
* **Cost:** 600 Poké Dollars (**Accessible/Mid-tier**). It serves as the bridge between the basic Poké Ball (200) and the high-end Ultra Ball (800-1200).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag in a wild encounter, it attempts to capture the target with a **1.5x catch rate modifier**. This makes it 50% more effective than a standard Poké Ball.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard Poké Balls generally cannot be used effectively via Fling in most generations, and this specific data lacks a `fling_power` value).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used for **aesthetic coordination**. In competitive play (VGC/Smogon), the Great Ball provides no mechanical advantage, but trainers often select it to match the color palette of Pokémon like Marill, Azumarill, or Heracross for "ball-matching" purposes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is a common item found by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability (typically between levels 11–60 depending on the specific game version).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at **Poké Marts** in all regions once a trainer has earned a specific number of Gym Badges (usually the second or third badge). It is also frequently found as a hidden item or in item balls throughout the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through retail purchase or the **Pickup** ability, where it is a common reward for low-to-mid-level Pokémon like Meowth, Teddiursa, or Zigzagoon.
