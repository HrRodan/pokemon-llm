## Identity & Utility
**Fightinium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically attuned to Fighting-type energy. When held by a Pokémon that knows a Fighting-type move, it allows the synchronization between Trainer and Pokémon to unleash a devastating Z-Move. It is a **Unique Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; Key Item-adjacent functionality).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder knows a Fighting-type damaging move, this item upgrades it to the Z-Move **All-Out Pummeling**. The power of the resulting Z-Move is scaled based on the base move's original power. If the holder knows a Fighting-type status move, it grants a **Z-Power effect** (e.g., Z-Bulk Up increases Attack further) in addition to the move's normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed by *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Wall-Breaker.** In the Generation VII meta (SM/USUM), Fightinium Z was a staple for physical attackers like **Buzzwole**, **Kartana**, and **Landorus-T** to bypass defensive walls. It provides a one-time "nuke" that ignores accuracy checks and penetrates protection moves (dealing 25% damage through *Protect*).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Mega Stones, this item is not restricted to specific species; any Pokémon capable of learning a Fighting-type move (such as *Close Combat* or *Focus Blast*) can utilize it. It requires the Trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained as a reward for completing the **Melemele Island Grand Trial**. It is gifted to the player by Kahuna Hala after his defeat.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, non-consumable item that remains in the player's inventory across battles.
* **Lore context:** Representing the fighting spirit of the Alola region, the Fightinium Z is one of the primary elemental crystals used to prove a trainer's mastery during the Island Challenge.
