## Identity & Utility
**TM183 (Super Fang)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask DLC)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the move **Super Fang** to compatible Pokémon. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use item in practice but can be reproduced infinitely if the player has the necessary materials and League Points (LP). 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires crafting via the **TM Machine** using 3,000 LP, 3 Dedenne Fur, and 3 Tandemaus Fur).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Super Fang**. Super Fang is a Normal-type physical move that deals **fixed damage** equal to exactly **50% of the target's current HP**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Niche Staple.** Super Fang is exceptionally powerful in competitive formats (VGC and Smogon) for "chunking" defensive walls. Since it ignores the user's Attack stat and the target's Defense stat, it is a reliable way for utility Pokémon (like **Maushold** or **Pachirisu**) to pressure bulky threats. It is also a premier tool in **Nuzlockes** and general playthroughs for weakening wild Pokémon to facilitate easier capture without the risk of an accidental knockout.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used by Normal-type utility Pokémon and various "fang" themed attackers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Accessible via the TM Machine once unlocked. The recipe is typically obtained by finding the TM in the wild within the **Kitakami region** (The Teal Mask) or by defeating a specific number of trainers in a designated area.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Dedenne** and **Tandemaus**, making these species essential for "farming" this TM's availability.
