## Identity & Utility
**Pichu Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A tuft of soft fur shed or dropped by the Pichu evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM). While it has a nominal sell value, its primary purpose is resource management for move tutoring.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is notably used in the synthesis of Electric-type moves such as **TM048 (Volt Switch)** and **TM072 (Electro Ball)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials in this category typically cannot be used with the move Fling and have no battle-ready effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression and customization item used for team building outside of active battle. It has no utility when held by a Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a modern "drop item" mechanic that rewards players for interacting with specific species in the wild.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Collected in the **Paldea region**, the **Land of Kitakami**, and the **Terarium**. It is acquired automatically after defeating or catching wild Pichu.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally "held" by the Pokémon in a way that requires the Thief or Covet moves; instead, it is a guaranteed drop rewarded upon the conclusion of an encounter with wild **Pichu**. It can also be found as a sparkling item on the ground in Pichu-populated habitats like South Province (Area One).
