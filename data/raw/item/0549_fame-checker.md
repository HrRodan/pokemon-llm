## Identity & Utility
**Fame Checker** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation III (Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen)**.
* **Description:** A specialized digital notepad that records and stores information, rumors, and facts about prominent figures in the Kanto region. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a database for NPCs. As the player interacts with specific characters or reads books/signs throughout the world, "entries" are unlocked for 24 famous individuals (including Gym Leaders, the Elite Four, and major characters like Prof. Oak, Bill, and Mr. Fuji). Collecting all six entries for a person rewards the player with a short message or quote from that character.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely narrative and completionist tool used during a single-player playthrough to deepen the lore of the game world.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on Pokémon evolution or battle stats. It serves exclusively as a tracking mechanism for world-building.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*, the Fame Checker is obtained from the player's rival, **Blue**, after defeating him at the Route 22 encounter (or, if skipped, it is given later in the game). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is unique to the player's inventory and is not influenced by the **Pickup** ability or any item-stealing moves.
* **Lore Context:** The Fame Checker was a feature unique to the Kanto remakes, designed to provide more personality and backstory to characters who had limited dialogue in the original Generation I games. It acts as a precursor to more advanced NPC tracking systems seen in later generations.
