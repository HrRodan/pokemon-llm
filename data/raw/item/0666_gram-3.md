## Identity & Utility
**Gram 3** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An important delivery letter intended for a specific Wingull. It is a **Key Item** that functions as a quest objective; it cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon in battle. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; Unique Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Gram 3 serves as one of three components (alongside Gram 1 and Gram 2) required to complete a delivery sidequest on **Unova Route 13**. When all three grams are returned to the Wingull belonging to the NPC on Route 13, the player is rewarded with **TM89 (U-turn)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists strictly for overworld progression and quest completion. However, the reward for the quest (TM89 U-turn) is a top-tier competitive staple.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It specifically interacts with the Wingull delivery script on Route 13 in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found on **Route 13** in the Unova region. In *Black and White*, it is typically found by interacting with a Treasure Hunter or found on the ground in the seaside area.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, Key Items like Gram 3 cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or stolen using **Covet/Thief**.
* **Lore Context:** This item represents the classic "fetch quest" mechanic prevalent in Unova's post-game, encouraging players to explore the nooks and crannies of the coastal routes to obtain powerful technical machines.
