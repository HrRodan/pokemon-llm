## Identity & Utility
**Relic-band** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An ancient bracelet crafted by a civilization roughly 3,000 years ago. It serves no functional purpose in battle or exploration and is classified as "vendor trash"—an item intended solely to be sold for a high profit. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot** be purchased from standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is realized only upon selling it to specific NPCs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Relic-band has no active effect. Its primary utility is its high resale value. While it sells for a nominal amount at standard shops, it can be sold to the **Maniac (Item Maniac)** or the **Billionaire in Undella Town (Villa Owner)** for a massive **100,000 Poké Dollars**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages. It is strictly a financial resource used to fund the purchase of competitive consumables like Vitamins or TMs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with any specific Pokémon abilities. It is not part of the "Pickup" ability loot table in most generations, making it a rare, fixed-location find.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in the **Abyssal Ruins** in the Unova region. Navigating the ruins requires the HM Surf and Dive. The Relic-band is part of a set of ancient artifacts (alongside the Relic Crown, Relic Statue, etc.) that represent the peak of Unovan archeological finds.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is typically found as a hidden item or inside treasure chests within ancient ruins.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Unova games (*Black, White, Black 2, White 2*), the Relic-band is one of the most efficient ways to hit the money cap. Because the "Maniac" collectors in Undella Town pay premium prices for "Relic" items, this item is a cornerstone of the late-game economy for players looking to buy expensive items like Protein or Calcius in bulk.
