## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR6859** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. It forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn regardless of the usual den rotation. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Promotional/Not for sale**). While it has a nominal data value, it is exclusively acquired via serial code distributions (often as a pre-order or retail bonus).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone structure in the Wild Area's Meetup Spot), it triggers a **Max Raid Battle** against a specific Pokémon. This raid persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured. 
    * *Note:* This specific crystal (SGR6859) was historically used to encounter **Jangmo-o** in *Pokémon Shield* or *Pokémon Sword*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for facilitating rare encounters and obtaining Pokémon with specific Hidden Abilities or high IVs through the resulting Max Raid.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is functionally similar to a Wishing Piece but guarantees a specific, predetermined encounter rather than a random one.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** promotions. These were typically bundled with the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield* Dual Pack or via specific retail collaborations (such as those with Amazon or GameStop).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability. It is a finite, event-only resource.
