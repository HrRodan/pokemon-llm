## Identity & Utility
**Gigantamix** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare and mysterious spice used specifically within the Pokémon Camp cooking mechanic. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily used to create "Gigantamax Curry." While it has a high internal cost value, it is not typically found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 15,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as the key ingredient in Pokémon Camp, it results in **Gigantamax Curry**. This specialized dish restores the party's HP and PP to maximum, cures status conditions, and provides a massive boost to Pokémon friendliness and experience points. It is the only ingredient that unlocks the 151st entry in the Galar Curry Dex.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Moderate damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as its effects are restricted to the overworld camp mechanics and cannot be used during a battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Curry Dex** system; using it allows the player to achieve the "Charizard Class" ranking more easily due to its high-quality modifier.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Gigantamix cannot be purchased from standard vendors or the Ingredient Sellers in the Wild Area. It is a **rare drop** rewarded to players for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles**, particularly those featuring 3-star to 5-star Gigantamax-capable Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is exclusively gathered through Galar's Raid Den system, making it one of the most difficult ingredients to farm for completionists.
* **Lore context:** The spice is implied to be infused with the same energy that allows Pokémon to Gigantamax, explaining its ability to make even a small portion of curry appear "gigantic" and offer superior restorative properties.
