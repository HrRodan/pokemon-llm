## Identity & Utility
**Medicine-pocket** is a System/Internal item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* data structure).
* **Description:** This is a non-functional, internal placeholder item used by the game's engine to define or categorize the "Medicine" section of the player's bag. It is a **System/UI** item that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** None. As an internal data entry categorized as "unused," it possesses no gameplay mechanics. It serves as a organizational anchor for the inventory UI rather than a consumable or held item.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item does not exist within the playable space of VGC, Smogon, or standard playthroughs. It is purely a back-end data artifact.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities (such as Pickup or Klutz).

## Acquisition & Lore
