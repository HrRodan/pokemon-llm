## Identity & Utility
**Water Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious crystalline fragment that glows with a blue, aquatic hue. It is a **Consumable Specialty Item** used specifically to manipulate the Terastal phenomenon. While it has a defined internal cost, it is primarily a collected resource rather than a standard store-bought item.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily serves as a resale value if not used for crafting/mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Water Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded to the chef at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali**. This allows the player to change a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to **Water**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta-Relevance.** While the item itself is not held in battle, it is a mandatory resource for competitive team building in Gen IX (VGC and Smogon). Changing a Pokémon's Tera Type to Water is a common defensive strategy to lose existing weaknesses or an offensive strategy to boost Water-type moves like Hydro Pump or Tera Blast (Water).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Terastal mechanic**, the signature gimmick of the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Tera Raid Battles:** Primarily obtained as a reward for defeating Water-type Raid Bosses (higher star ratings yield more shards).
    * **Overworld:** Found as sparkling dropped items throughout the Paldea region and the Terarium (Indigo Disk).
    * **Special Locations:** Often rewarded by NPCs or via the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or certain Hold Items, these shards are gathered through environmental interaction and raid participation rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
