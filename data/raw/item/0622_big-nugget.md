## Identity & Utility
**Big Nugget** is a **Loot/Valuable** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A massive piece of pure gold that emits a lustrous gleam. It is a **Consumable (Sale)** item that cannot be bought from standard Marts; its sole purpose is to be liquidated for high currency yields. It represents the "Super" tier of the standard Nugget.
* **Cost:** 40,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value Treasure**). While the internal cost is 40,000, it typically sells for 20,000 at standard shops and up to 30,000 to specialized collectors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as "vendor trash" designed to be sold for profit. In specific regions like Unova, it can be sold to the Ore Collector (Maniac) for a premium price of **30,000 Poké Dollars**, significantly higher than the standard sale price.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** **130** (Extremely High). It is one of the most powerful items to use with the move **Fling**, though this consumes the high-value item permanently.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Resource Only.** It has no passive held-item benefits. In a competitive or "Item Clause" environment, it is never used except for gimmick one-shot Fling builds. In Nuzlockes, it is a critical resource for purchasing expensive Vitamins (Protein, Iron, etc.) to optimize EVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is a high-tier reward for the **Pickup** ability, usually only obtainable by Pokémon at Level 81 or higher.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a hidden item in late-game areas (e.g., Abyssal Ruins, Resolution Cave) or rewarded by NPCs for completing difficult tasks, such as defeating the Morimoto NPC or clearing specific Battle Facility streaks.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Garbodor** (5% chance). This provides a lore-based "trash to treasure" connection, implying Garbodor occasionally consumes or integrates high-value minerals into its body of refuse. It is frequently farmed by players using the **Thief** or **Covet** moves.
