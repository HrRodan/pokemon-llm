## Identity & Utility
**Jam** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A sweet, fruit-based condiment used primarily during the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a **Consumable overworld item** that can be bought in bulk from food vendors. 
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Highly Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a condiment in sandwich making. It provides a significant boost to the **Sweet** flavor profile. When used in recipes, it typically contributes to **Egg Power**, **Item Drop Power**, and **Catching Power**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** (Direct Combat). However, it is a staple for **Competitive Breeders** because it is a primary ingredient in "Egg Power" sandwiches (like the Jam Sandwich), which significantly increases the speed of finding Pokémon Eggs at Picnics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the Paldean **Meal Power** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at retail outlets throughout the Paldea region, including **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Sure Cans**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or traditional held items, Jam is a processed culinary good and must be purchased from urban markets.
