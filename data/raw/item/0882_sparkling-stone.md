## Identity & Utility
**Sparkling Stone** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A sacred, shimmering stone entrusted to the player by a Guardian Deity of Alola (Tapu Koko). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It serves as the mystical catalyst required to harness Z-Power.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Sparkling Stone is a prerequisite for the player to obtain the **Z-Ring** (Sun/Moon) or **Z-Power Ring** (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon). Once the player receives the stone from Tapu Koko, Island Kahuna Hala refines it into a wearable ring.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the stone itself does not appear in battle, it is the **narrative enabler** for the entire Z-Move mechanic. In the context of Generation VII competitive play (VGC 2017–2019 and Smogon), the possession of the resulting Z-Ring allows Pokémon to utilize powerful one-time Z-Moves when holding a corresponding Z-Crystal.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities. It functions strictly as a story-gated progression item to unlock the region's central combat mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as part of the main storyline. In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the player receives the stone from **Tapu Koko** after rescuing "Nebby" (Cosmog) at the Mahalo Trail.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is unique and is **never** found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore Context:** The stone is considered a gift from the Alolan deities. Its "sparkle" represents the bond between humans and Pokémon, which is necessary to manifest the "Z-Power" derived from the region's energy. In the Alolan trials, it signifies a trainer's worthiness to participate in the Island Challenge.
