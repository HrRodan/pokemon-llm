## Identity & Utility
**TM48 (Technical Machine 48)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation III** (though the TM numbering system exists from Generation I).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In its most modern iterations (Generation V and onwards), it is associated with the move **Round**, whereas in previous generations it taught **Skill Swap**, **Fire Punch**, or **Rock Slide**. It is a **Consumable** item in early and the most recent generations (Gen 9), but was **Infinite Use** between Generations V and VII.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon that cannot learn it through leveling up. The move taught varies significantly by the game version:
    * **Generations V–VII:** Teaches **Round** (Normal-type, Special, 60 BP). If multiple Pokémon use Round in the same turn, its power doubles and they move immediately after the first user.
    * **Generations III–IV:** Teaches **Skill Swap** (Psychic-type, Status), which swaps the user's Ability with the target's.
    * **Generation II:** Teaches **Fire Punch**.
    * **Generation I:** Teaches **Rock Slide**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle; TMs are generally restricted from the Fling mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Round:** Primarily a "gimmick" move used in Double Battles. It requires a specific team composition to be effective, allowing slower teammates to "speed up" their attack order.
        * **Skill Swap:** A niche but high-ceiling competitive move in VGC/Doubles, used to reset Intimidate, pass beneficial abilities like *Levitate* to allies, or remove detrimental abilities like *Truant* or *Defeatist*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon (the "All-Machines" category), often used to provide coverage or utility moves to Pokémon that lack them naturally.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Department Stores** (such as Celadon, Goldenrod, or Lilycove) or found in the overworld. In Generation V, it is specifically obtained in the Battle Subway or at the Shopping Mall Nine. In Generation IX, it is crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon Materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and must be found in the overworld, received from NPCs, or purchased via Marts/Battle Points.
