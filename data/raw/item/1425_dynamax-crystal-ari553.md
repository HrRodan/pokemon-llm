## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ari553)** is a **Special Event Item (Dynamax Crystal)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specific event-triggering consumable used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to appear. It is a single-use consumable that disappears after the raid is triggered or at the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but functionally **Not for Sale**; these are distributed via external serial codes and promotional events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Causes a specific Pokémon (determined by the internal ID "ari553") to appear as a Max Raid Battle encounter at the Watchtower Lair. This encounter persists until the end of the calendar day. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A.** This is a utility item for the overworld. Its competitive value lies entirely in the Pokémon captured from the resulting raid, which may possess Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), or the Gigantamax factor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, it is the primary mechanism for accessing specific Max Raid encounters that may not be available through standard Den resets.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through standard Marts or gameplay loops. It is typically acquired via **Serial Code distributions** (e.g., pre-order bonuses, retail promotions, or magazine inserts like CoroCoro). 
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item exists outside the standard Pokémon ecology and is treated as a promotional key-consumable.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals contain concentrated Dynamax energy capable of forcing a Power Spot to manifest a specific localized projection of a Pokémon.
