## Identity & Utility
**Lechonk Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea region).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Lechonk evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Resource** used specifically at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. While it has no direct utility in battle or the overworld, it serves as a critical currency for move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Resource Grade). It is generally more valuable when converted into League Points (LP) or used in crafting than when sold for cash.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, it is notably used to create early-to-mid-game moves such as **TM001 (Take Down)** and **TM014 (Acrobatics)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used as a held item in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is strictly relegated to the **pre-battle preparation phase**, allowing trainers to customize movepools for competitive builds.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting reagent.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching a wild **Lechonk** or its evolution, **Oinkologne**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag automatically upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Lechonk line. 
* **Context:** As Lechonk is one of the most common early-route Pokémon in the Paldea region, Lechonk Hair is often the first crafting material a trainer will encounter, serving as an introduction to the Generation IX crafting mechanics.
