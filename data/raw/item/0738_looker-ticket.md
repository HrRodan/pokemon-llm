## Identity & Utility
**Looker Ticket** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A unique, handmade ticket created by the International Police officer Looker, famously decorated with a "liberal amount of glittery paint." It is a **Key Item** that is non-consumable and **cannot** be bought or sold at any Poké Mart.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Unique Acquisition/Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the trigger and progression tool for the **Looker Bureau postgame questline** in Pokémon X and Y. Possession of the ticket (or the events surrounding it) allows the player to access the various "Chapters" of the Looker sub-story in Lumiose City.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld narrative progression and has no impact on competitive battling or Pokémon stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It interacts exclusively with the game's script to unlock post-Champion content involving the characters Looker and Emma.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained in **Lumiose City** during the postgame. After the player defeats the Elite Four and becomes the Kalos Champion, they receive a message on their Holo Caster from a "mysterious stranger." Upon visiting the Looker Bureau (located in a vacant building in the Magenta Plaza), Looker provides the player with the quest details associated with this ticket.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. This is a unique story item tied to a specific NPC event.
* **Lore Context:** The item’s "handmade" and "glittery" description highlights Looker’s somewhat eccentric and hands-on investigative style, distinguishing it from official International Police equipment. It serves as a symbol of the player's recruitment as Looker's assistant.
