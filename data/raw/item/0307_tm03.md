## Identity & Utility
**TM03 (Technical Machine 03)** is a **Learning Machine** introduced in **Generation I**, though its specific contents have shifted significantly across the franchise's history.
* **Description:** A single-use or infinite-use (depending on Generation) data disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move it cannot learn through leveling up. It represents a high-value instructional tool for customizing movepools.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Luxury Item**). The high price tag reflects its status as a late-game or high-utility tactical asset in most regional marketplaces.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. The move contained within TM03 has historically changed across generations:
    * **Gen I:** **Swords Dance** (Boosts Attack by two stages; highly valuable for physical sweepers).
    * **Gen II:** **Curse** (Variable effects based on Typing; a cornerstone of competitive stall/setup).
    * **Gen III–IV:** **Water Pulse** (60 BP Water move with a 20% confusion chance).
    * **Gen V–VIII:** **Psyshock** (80 BP Psychic move that calculates damage based on the target’s Physical Defense; a competitive staple for special attackers to bypass "Special Walls" like Blissey).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be effectively used with Fling; if attempted, they typically have a base power of 10 and no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Depending on the Generation, TM03 is often a **Competitive Staple**. In Gen I, Swords Dance is essential for setup. In Gen V onwards, Psyshock is mandatory for Special Attackers in Smogon/VGC formats to handle high-Special Defense targets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited to the "Compatible" list, which varies by the move contained within the disc.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available at Department Stores (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove) or high-end vendors like the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree for BP. In Gen V (Black/White), it is notably found in the Giant Chasm.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found held by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased, found as overworld loot, or received from Gym Leaders (In Gen III, it is given by Wallace/Juan after defeating the Sootopolis Gym).
* **Historical Context:** While modern TMs in most games are infinite-use, in earlier generations (I-IV) and certain remakes (BDSP), TM03 is consumed upon use, necessitating careful resource management for Nuzlocke or competitive team building.
