## Identity & Utility
**Yellow-apricorn** is a specialized crafting material categorized under the **Apricorn-box** group, primarily associated with the Johto region (introduced in Generation II and featured in the Generation IV remakes).
* **Description:** A yellow Apricorn characterized by an "invigorating scent." It serves as a raw material that can be processed by a craftsman into specialized Poké Balls. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that is generally collected for free from the environment rather than purchased.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; though rarely sold in shops, this value represents its internal economic weight).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Yellow Apricorn's sole function is to be given to the NPC **Kurt in Azalea Town**. After a 24-hour waiting period, Kurt converts the Apricorn into a **Moon Ball**, a specialized Poké Ball that has a 4x catch rate modifier when used on Pokémon that evolve using a **Moon Stone** (e.g., Nidorina, Nidorino, Clefairy, Jigglypuff, Munna).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely Low; provides no additional status effects or significant damage when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive battling (VGC/Smogon). Its value lies entirely in "Aesthetic/Apriball" collecting and breeding, as Pokémon caught in Moon Balls can pass down the ball type to their offspring.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution directly. It is a prerequisite for obtaining the Moon Ball, which is a key item for collectors specializing in "Apri-mons."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by harvesting **Apricorn Trees** found throughout the Johto region (e.g., Route 31, 42, and Violet City). In *HeartGold/SoulSilver*, players must possess the **Apricorn Box** to collect and carry them.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is exclusively gathered from the overworld map. 
* **Lore context:** The art of turning Apricorns into Poké Balls is a traditional Johto craft practiced almost exclusively by Kurt. Before the mass production of modern Silph Co. or Devon Corp Poké Balls, Apricorn-based balls were the standard tool for trainers.
