## Identity & Utility
**Choice Scarf** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An iconic "Choice" series item designed for high-level tactical play. It provides a massive boost to the holder's agility at the cost of tactical flexibility. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that is generally not found in standard Poké Marts, usually requiring specialized currency or post-game access.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Interpretive: **Moderate/Premium price**; typically localized to Battle Frontier or Battle Point exchanges rather than common shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon’s **Speed is increased by 50% (1.5x)**. However, the holder is "locked" into the very first move it selects. This restriction remains until the Pokémon is switched out of battle or the item is removed/suppressed (e.g., via Knock Off or Klutz).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; Flinging this item is generally disadvantageous unless passing a detrimental lock to an opponent).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Tier-1 Competitive Staple.** It is the premier tool for "Revenge Killing," allowing a Pokémon to outspeed and eliminate a threat that has already taken damage. It is also used on "Speed Control" leads and to "Scarf-lock" opponents by using **Trick** or **Switcheroo** to force a defensive wall into a single, ineffective move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It has specific interactions with **U-turn** and **Volt Switch**; if a user is switched in via one of these moves and holds the Scarf, it remains locked into that pivoting move if it was the last move used.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally acquired through post-game Battle Facilities (Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, Battle Maison, Battle Tree) for Battle Points (BP). In some regions, it is a rare find in the overworld or a reward for specific NPC quests.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon in standard encounters (`total_held_by: 0`). This rarity reinforces its status as a professional trainer's tool rather than a natural occurrence.
