## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PHE99)** is a **Special Event Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specific variety of Dynamax Crystal used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once consumed, the designated Pokémon will appear as a raid boss until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot be bought** through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily used for internal game logic as these are distributed via serial codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it activates a red beam of light, forcing a specific Max Raid encounter (determined by the crystal's ID) to spawn. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) raid encounters to obtain specific Pokémon, often with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but the raids triggered by these crystals are often the primary method for obtaining **Gigantamax-capable** species or Pokémon with high individual values (IVs).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events, pre-order bonuses, or movie ticket distributions. They are not found in the overworld or sold by NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. Unlike standard Max Raid Dens which reset based on Wishing Pieces or natural daily cycles, a Dynamax Crystal provides a **guaranteed, specific encounter** that persists even if the player loses the battle, until the midnight reset.
* **Context:** In the Galar narrative, these crystals are highly condensed forms of Galar Particles, capable of localizing the Power Spot phenomenon at a specific ruin.
