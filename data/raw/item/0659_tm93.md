## Identity & Utility
**TM93 (Technical Machine 93)** is a move-teaching device introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a data-storage disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. Historically, it is most recognized for teaching **Wild Charge**, though its contents shifted to **Eerie Impulse** in the Sword & Shield era. As a Technical Machine, its usage (single-use vs. infinite) depends on the specific region's technology.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a compatible Pokémon a powerful or tactical Electric-type move. 
    * **Move 1 (Wild Charge):** A physical Electric-type attack (90 BP) that deals 1/4 recoil damage to the user.
    * **Move 2 (Eerie Impulse):** A status move that harshly lowers the target's Special Attack stat by two stages.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Wild Charge:** A mandatory coverage move for physical attackers that lack better Electric options (e.g., Arcanine, Zacian, Luxray).
        * **Eerie Impulse:** A high-level support move in VGC and doubles formats, used to neutralize Special Attacking threats like Kyogre or Calyrex-Shadow.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Compatibility is broad among Electric-types and physical "bruiser" Pokémon (like Arcanine or Tauros) when teaching Wild Charge.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Unova (Black/White)**, it is purchased at the Victory Road Pokémon Center. 
    * In **Galar (Sword/Shield)**, it is found in the Rose Tower/Battle Tower area. 
    * In **Paldea (Scarlet/Violet)**, it teaches **Flash Cannon** (note: TM numbering often shifts between generations).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through Department Stores, TM Machines, or as a reward for exploration.
* **Generational Context:** TM93 represents the transition of TMs from rare, single-use treasures to standard, mass-produced tactical tools. Its relatively low cost of 1,000 Poké Dollars makes it an easy mid-game pickup for players needing to bolster their team's type coverage.
