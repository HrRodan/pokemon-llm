## Identity & Utility
**Punching Glove** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized protective glove designed to be held by a Pokémon. It augments the striking power of punches and provides a physical barrier between the attacker and the target. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **Can** be bought at specific retail locations.
* **Cost:** 15,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the power of "punching moves" (moves affected by the Iron Fist ability, such as Meteor Mash, Drain Punch, and the Elemental Punches) by **10%**. 
* **Contact Negation:** Crucially, this item changes the mechanics of punching moves so the holder **does not make contact** with the target. This protects the user from negative "contact" effects, such as **Rocky Helmet** chip damage, **Rough Skin/Iron Barbs**, and status-inflicting abilities like **Flame Body**, **Effect Spore**, or **Static**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard damage, no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a niche but effective choice for physical attackers who rely on moves like *Jet Punch* or *Drain Punch*. While the 1.1x damage boost is lower than a Life Orb or Choice Band, the ability to bypass **Rocky Helmet** and **Rough Skin** makes it a strong anti-meta pick in VGC and Smogon formats, especially for Pokémon like **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike** or **Iron Hands**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item provides a multiplicative boost that **stacks** with the **Iron Fist** ability (e.g., on Hitmonchan or Melmetal), making punching moves significantly more oppressive.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, it can be purchased from **Delibird Presents** in Cascarrafa after the player earns four Gym Badges. It is also awarded by the Pokémon League representative at the East Province (Area Three) Watchtower after defeating seven trainers in the area.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon; this is a manufactured tool designed for professional Pokémon battling.
