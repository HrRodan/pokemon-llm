## Identity & Utility
**Barboach Slime** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item consists of the slippery, protective film secreted by Barboach. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** used at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. While it can be sold at marts, its primary value lies in its use as a reagent.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component in the crafting recipes for various TMs. Specifically, it is utilized for Ground- and Water-type moves (such as **TM133 Earth Power** and **TM149 Earthquake** in the Paldean region).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no strategic application in VGC or Smogon formats; it is purely a resource for move acquisition during the main game or preparation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "TM Materials" pocket, which is separate from standard hold items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in regions featuring the **TM Machine** mechanic (Paldea and the Kitakami/Blueberry Academy areas). It is obtained by defeating or catching members of the Barboach evolutionary line.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Barboach** and **Whiscash**. Players typically farm this item in muddy ponds or wetlands where these Pokémon spawn frequently.
