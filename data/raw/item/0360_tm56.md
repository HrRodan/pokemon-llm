## Identity & Utility
**TM56** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** It is a data-disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. As a Machine category item, it is consumed upon use in earlier generations but became infinite-use in Generation V through VIII, and craftable in Generation IX. This specific TM is most historically associated with the move **Fling**, though its contents changed to **Stealth Rock** in the *Let's Go* series.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Fling (Gens IV–VII, VIII–IX):** The user throws its held item to attack. The move's power and secondary effects (like flinching or status conditions) depend entirely on the item being held.
    * **Stealth Rock (Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee):** Sets an entry hazard of levitating stones that damages opponents upon switching into battle based on their type weakness to Rock.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The TM itself cannot be Flung; it is a teaching tool).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Fling:** Highly niche. Used in specific strategies to trigger items like the *Flame Orb* (to burn an opponent) or *Iron Ball* (for maximum damage).
        * **Stealth Rock:** A mandatory competitive staple in almost every singles format (Smogon/6v6) for chip damage and breaking *Sturdy/Focus Sashes*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to Pokémon within the specific move's "learnset."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In its debut (**Sinnoh**), it is gifted by a man on Route 222.
    * In **Unova**, it is found in Mistralton Cave.
    * In **Galar**, it is found in the Glimwood Tangle.
    * In **Paldea**, it is craftable at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials (specifically Combee Honey and Happiny Dust).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; TMs are typically found as overworld "Poke Ball" items, received from NPCs, or purchased at Department Stores/League Staff vendors.
