## Identity & Utility
**Griseous Core** is a **Gameplay / Transformation Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A large, glowing orb of matter that seems to harbor the power of the Distortion World. It is a **Non-consumable Special Item** that cannot be bought or sold. While it functions as a Key Item in its debut title, it serves as a **Held Item** in traditional battle formats to alter the morphology of a specific Legendary Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on or held by **Giratina**, it triggers a form change from its **Altered Forme** to its **Origin Forme**. 
    * In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, this is a permanent toggle used from the bag.
    * In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, it must be held by Giratina to maintain the Origin Forme.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Type Boost:** While held, it increases the power of **Ghost-type** and **Dragon-type** moves by **20%**.
    * **Ability Modification:** Changing Giratina to its Origin Forme swaps its ability from **Pressure** (or Telepathy) to **Levitate**, granting it immunity to Ground-type moves.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Staple (Ubers).** This item is mandatory for running Giratina-Origin, a premier offensive defogger and ground-immune tank in high-tier competitive play. It offers a unique niche by providing both a damage multiplier and a crucial ability change that distinguishes it from the bulkier, grounded Altered Forme.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically interacts with **Giratina**. It does not trigger evolution but manages "Forme Change."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Pokémon Legends: Arceus:** Obtained after defeating/catching Giratina at Turnback Cave following the main story and Request 102: "Daybreak."
    * **Pokémon Scarlet & Violet:** Available via the **Porto Marinada auction** if the player has a Giratina in their party or boxes.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique artifact associated with the creation trio (Dialga, Palkia, Giratina) and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore Context:** The Griseous Core represents the stabilized essence of the Distortion World, allowing Giratina to maintain its true, serpentine form outside of its home dimension. It is the modern mechanical equivalent to the **Griseous Orb**, though the Core specifically facilitates the transformation in newer engine iterations.
