## Identity & Utility
**Pamtre Berry** is a **Baking-only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A rare, ornamental berry used primarily as a high-tier ingredient for crafting **Pokéblocks** and **Poffins**. Unlike medicinal berries, it has no direct restorative properties and is designed for the gardening and Contest sub-games. It is a **Consumable/Plantable** item that is technically purchasable but rarely sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its value lies in its rarity and growth cycle rather than its price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively for planting in soft soil or as an ingredient in baking sweets (Pokéblocks in Hoenn/ORAS and Poffins in Sinnoh). It is highly effective for increasing a Pokémon’s **Beauty** and **Cute** conditions for Pokémon Contests.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Natural Gift:** When held, it allows the move Natural Gift to become a **Steel-type** attack with a base power of **90** (Gen IV–V) or **100** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-existent.** It has no passive trigger in battle (like healing or status cure). Its only utility in a competitive environment is as a specific Steel-type coverage option via *Natural Gift*, though this is rarely optimal compared to traditional held items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily interacted with through the **Berry Planter** or **Berry Pots**, and its growth rate is notably slow, often requiring significant time and watering to yield a high harvest.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained through special means rather than Marts. In Hoenn, it is famously acquired from the **Berry Master’s Wife** by telling her the specific phrase "CHALLENGE CONTEST." In Sinnoh, it can be found in the **Amity Square** or gifted by NPCs. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be cultivated by the trainer or received as a gift from NPCs who recognize the trainer's dedication to Contests.
* **Lore Context:** Known for its striking appearance, the Pamtre Berry is often associated with the high-society world of Pokémon Contests rather than the rough-and-tumble nature of the Pokémon League.
