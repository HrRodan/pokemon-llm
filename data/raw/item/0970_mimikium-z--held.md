## Identity & Utility
**Mimikium Z** is a **Z-Crystal (Signature Held Item)** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically tuned to the Pokémon Mimikyu. When held by Mimikyu, it allows the transformation of a standard move into a powerful, cinematic Z-Move. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought, sold, or traded** via standard markets.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is a **Mimikyu** and knows the move **Play Rough**, this crystal upgrades that move into the signature Fairy-type Z-Move: **Let's Snuggle Forever**. 
    * **Base Power:** 190.
    * **Mechanism:** This move deals massive physical damage and ignores accuracy checks, but can only be used once per battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Generational Staple (Gen 7).** In Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon competitive formats (VGC 2018/2019 and Smogon Gen 7), Mimikium Z was the premier item for Mimikyu. It allowed Mimikyu to utilize its "Disguise" ability to safely set up a Swords Dance and then fire off a 190-power nuke to eliminate key threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Strict Requirement:** Only functions when held by Mimikyu. 
    * **Protection:** In battle, Z-Crystals are immune to being removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, and are unaffected by the ability *Sticky Hold* or *Klutz*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is exclusive to **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is obtained after the player completes the trial at the **Abandoned Thrifty Megamart** on Ula'ula Island. The player must follow a Mimikyu into the back room to receive the crystal.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item tied to a specific story event and cannot be farmed from wild Pokémon or found via the **Pickup** ability.
