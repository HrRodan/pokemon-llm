## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1165** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-based consumable used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that persists until midnight of the day it was activated. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; technically "Cheap" but typically acquired via serial code or promotion).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the stone pillar at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it beam-activates a Max Raid Battle. The specific encounter for the Tau1165 variant is historically associated with version-exclusive Pokémon (typically **Larvitar** for players of Pokémon Sword, or **Jangmo-o** for players of Pokémon Shield).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for catching Pokémon and has no function in competitive battles. However, the Pokémon caught via this crystal are often used in competitive play, as they typically feature high IVs or specific Hidden Abilities common to Max Raid encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the Raid den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal gameplay. It was distributed via **Serial Code** as a promotional bonus (notably for purchasers of the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack*). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a digital distribution item meant to bridge version gaps by allowing players to encounter Pokémon not normally found in their version of the game.
