## Identity & Utility
**Academy Bottle** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's picnic set. It is a **Cosmetic Overworld** item that allows players to change the visual theme of their picnic table. Based on its naming convention, it represents the school spirit of the Naranja or Uva Academy.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale** or acquired through specific progression/special event triggers). In-game variants are typically purchased at "Picnic Knacks" shops for 1,000 Poké Dollars, but the base "Academy" version is often a default or special acquisition.

## Effect & Mechanics

* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on the competitive meta (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held by a Pokémon and provides no combat utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not interact with Pokémon evolution or abilities like Pickup. It is categorized strictly as a player-character customization tool.
