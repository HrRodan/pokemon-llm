## Identity & Utility
**Bramblin Twig** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Bramblin evolutionary line. It is categorized as a crafting component primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a small amount of currency.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient in the creation of Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, it is a required component for crafting various moves, most notably **TM029 (Hex)**, **TM155 (Spite)**, and **TM111 (Giga Drain)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **No Competitive Utility.** As a material item, it cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle to provide stat boosts or tactical advantages. Its value is strictly limited to out-of-battle progression and move-pool customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it is a drop from the Bramblin line, it is **not** an evolution item. Bramblin evolves into Brambleghast through the "Let's Go" walking mechanic (1,000 steps), not through the consumption of these twigs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Bramblin family. It is typically stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is guaranteed to drop from:
    * **Bramblin:** Found commonly in the **Asado Desert** and **East Province (Area Three)**.
    * **Brambleghast:** Found in the same arid regions, though less frequently than its pre-evolution.
* **Lore Context:** The twig represents a piece of the dried, tangled vine that makes up the Tumbleweed Pokémon’s body, reflecting its Ghost/Grass typing through its use in crafting eerie or life-draining moves like Hex and Giga Drain.
