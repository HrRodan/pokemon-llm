## Identity & Utility
**Shinx Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Shinx evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting resource used at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Resource** that cannot be used directly from the bag for healing or held by a Pokémon for battle effects.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource value; primarily used for LP exchange or crafting rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) and other materials at a TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in the Fling mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the **out-of-battle economy** and team preparation by enabling the creation of TMs to expand a Pokémon's movepool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone or a "baby trigger" item. It is part of the crafting ecosystem introduced to provide a gameplay loop between catching/defeating wild Pokémon and move acquisition.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts. It is acquired exclusively as a drop after battling wild Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item/Drops:** Dropped by wild **Shinx**, **Luxio**, and **Luxray** upon being defeated or caught. Unlike traditional "Held Items," these are added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag and are frequently farmed in areas like the South Province of Paldea.
