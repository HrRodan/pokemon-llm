## Identity & Utility
**Surprise-mulch** is a specialized **Mulch** item introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A fertilizer used specifically in the cultivation of Berries. It is a consumable overworld item used to treat soil before planting a Berry. While highly effective in its home region of Kalos, it is documented as being unsuitable for the soil in other regions like Hoenn and Alola, where it serves no functional purpose.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a patch of soil, it significantly **increases the chance of Berry mutation**. This occurs when two different species of Berries are planted in adjacent plots, potentially resulting in a third, rare variety of Berry (e.g., crossing a Mago and Iapapa Berry to produce a Pomeg Berry).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard physical damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the "Berry Field" gardening mechanic and holds no value in VGC or Smogon formats, as its effects are limited to the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a core component for players aiming to complete the Berry Dex or farm specific Berries used for EV reduction or competitive held items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is primarily acquired at the **Berry Fields on Route 7**, where it can be purchased or created using the Mulch Maker by composting fallen Berries. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** The existence of Surprise-mulch highlights the region-specific agricultural mechanics of Kalos. Its obsolescence in later titles (as noted in its Sun/Moon flavor text) reflects the shift away from complex Berry mutation mechanics in subsequent generations.
