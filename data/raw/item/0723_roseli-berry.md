## Identity & Utility
**Roseli-berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A held berry that mitigates damage from incoming Fairy-type moves. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically valued at a low cost, though it is primarily obtained through cultivation or foraging rather than standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it is consumed to **halve the damage** taken from a single **super-effective Fairy-type attack**. It activates before the damage is dealt, potentially turning an OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) into a survival.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no secondary status effect when flung).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fairy-type** attack with **60 Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **niche competitive item** frequently used on Dragon, Dark, or Fighting-type Pokémon (such as Garchomp, Roaring Moon, or Urshifu) to lure and survive powerful Fairy-type moves like Moonblast or Play Rough, allowing the holder to retaliate or set up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Like most berries, its effectiveness is negated by abilities like **Unnerve** or **Klutz**, and it can be recycled via the move **Recycle** or the ability **Harvest**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired through specialized Berry Fields (X/Y), mutation mechanics, or given by NPCs who appreciate Fairy-type lore. In later generations, it is often found under sparkling trees or in wild Berry piles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently, there are **no common wild Pokémon** recorded as holding this item naturally. It is most reliably gathered through **Berry cultivation** or the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets depending on the game version.
* **Context:** Introduced specifically to balance the newly added Fairy-type in Generation VI, providing a defensive countermeasure against the "Dragon-slaying" element.
