## Identity & Utility
**Acro-bike** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized folding bicycle designed for technical maneuvers and obstacle navigation. Unlike the standard bicycle or the speed-focused Mach Bike, the Acro-bike prioritizes agility and trick-based traversal. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases movement speed outside and in caves (faster than Running Shoes, but slower than the Mach Bike). Its defining feature is the ability to perform **tricks** to navigate the environment:
    * **Bunny Hops:** Holding the B-button allows the player to hop in place or move while hopping. This is required to cross thin white rails or "stepping stone" bridges.
    * **Wheelies:** Tapping the B-button allows the player to ride on the back wheel, which can be used to jump up or down specific ledges.
    * **Side Jumps:** Allows for lateral jumping across specific gaps.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusively for overworld traversal and accessing optional areas within the story (e.g., sections of the Safari Zone and Sky Pillar).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. However, it is essential for reaching certain "Secret Base" locations and rare item spawns that are blocked by rail-based puzzles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained from **Rydel's Cycles** in Mauville City. In the Hoenn-based games (*Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire*), the player must choose between the Acro-bike and the Mach Bike, though they can return to the shop to swap them at any time. In the remakes, fulfilling specific requirements allows the player to carry both bikes simultaneously.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. As a unique Key Item, it is never found on wild Pokémon and is unaffected by the **Pickup** ability.
