## Identity & Utility
**Choice Specs** is a **Choice Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon. These distinctive glasses provide a massive boost to mental focus and power, significantly increasing Special Attack while narrowing the user's focus to a single technique. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is generally not available in early-game shops.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range**). While it has a cash value, it is most commonly acquired through specialized Battle Facilities using non-currency points (BP/LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon's **Special Attack is increased by 50% (1.5x)**. In exchange, the holder is restricted to using only the first move it selects in battle. This "lock" remains in effect until the holder is switched out, the battle ends, or the item is removed/exchanged.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; generally a poor candidate for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** It is the premier item for "Special Wallbreakers." In both Smogon and VGC formats, it is used to allow powerful attackers (e.g., Chi-Yu, Flutter Mane, Kyogre) to OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) opponents that would otherwise survive a hit. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Trick/Switcheroo:** A common high-level tactic involves using *Trick* to give Choice Specs to a defensive "Wall" (like Blissey or Toxapex). This forces the defensive Pokémon to lock into a single move (often a non-damaging status move), effectively neutralizing their utility for the rest of the match.
    * **Pivot Moves:** Users often run *Volt Switch* or *U-turn* with this item to deal heavy damage and switch out, resetting the move lock and maintaining momentum.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, Choice Specs are found in late-game areas or purchased from the **Battle Frontier, Battle Maison, or Delibird Presents** (in Paldea). They are treated as professional-grade equipment for elite trainers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found on wild Pokémon**. It is an artificial tool specifically designed for competitive Pokémon battling and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability.
