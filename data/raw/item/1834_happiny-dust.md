## Identity & Utility
**Happiny Dust** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Happiny evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at the TM Machine. While it has a listed cost, it is typically gathered through gameplay rather than purchased.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily used as a secondary currency for move acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required component at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to craft specific TMs. It serves as a "recipe ingredient" alongside League Points (LP).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the dust itself has no utility in battle, it is essential for crafting high-value competitive TMs such as **TM080 (Metronome)**, **TM120 (Psychic)**, and **TM161 (Trick Room)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the Happiny line rather than a catalyst for their growth.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the Paldea region (and associated DLC areas) by defeating or catching wild **Happiny**, **Chansey**, or **Blissey**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a **guaranteed drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter with the following Pokémon:
    * **Happiny:** Commonly found in early-game grassy areas.
    * **Chansey:** Often found in North Province or near Fairy-type Team Star bases; a primary source of EXP farming.
    * **Blissey:** Rare spawns in high-level areas.
* **Context:** Because Chansey and Blissey are frequently targeted by players for "Power Leveling" due to their high EXP yield, Happiny Dust is often one of the most abundant materials in a trainer's inventory during the mid-to-late game.
