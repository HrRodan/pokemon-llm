## Identity & Utility
**Utility Umbrella** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A sturdy, specialized umbrella that protects the holder from the mechanical effects of specific weather conditions. It is a permanent **Competitive Held Item** that is commercially available.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced tactical gear).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon ignores the effects of **Rain** and **Harsh Sunlight**. This applies to both the damage modifiers and secondary mechanics associated with these weather types:
    * **Rain Mechanics:** The holder does not receive the 50% damage boost to Water-type moves or the 50% damage reduction to Fire-type moves. Moves like *Thunder* and *Hurricane* do not benefit from perfect accuracy against the holder.
    * **Sun Mechanics:** The holder does not receive the 50% damage boost to Fire-type moves or the 50% damage reduction to Water-type moves. It also prevents *Solar Beam* and *Solar Blade* from skipping their charging turn when used by or against the holder.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Mid-tier physical damage with no additional effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **niche defensive staple**. It is most commonly used on dedicated walls (like Blissey) in formats where weather-based offenses (such as Rain teams led by Kyogre or Sun teams led by Groudon/Koraidon) are dominant. It allows a Pokémon to "ignore" the massive power multipliers that weather-based sweepers rely on.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Ability Interactions:** The umbrella negates the holder's weather-based abilities. For example, a Pokémon with *Chlorophyll* will not get a Speed boost, and a Pokémon with *Solar Power* will not lose HP, but also will not receive the Special Attack boost.
    * **Exclusions:** It provides **no protection** against the damage or effects of Sandstorm, Hail, or Snow.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Galar), it is purchasable at the Pokémon Center in central Hammerlocke. In subsequent generations, it is usually found in high-end departmental stores or shops catering to competitive trainers.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a piece of human-made utility equipment rather than a natural occurrence in the wild.
