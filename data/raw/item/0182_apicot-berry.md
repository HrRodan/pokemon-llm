## Identity & Utility
**Apicot-berry** is a **In-a-pinch Stat-booster Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable Berry designed for competitive and tactical play. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that triggers automatically in response to low health. While it has a nominal value of 80 Poké Dollars, it is typically categorized as a "rare" berry not sold in standard Poké Marts, requiring cultivation or specific end-game acquisition.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap, but generally not for sale; primarily obtained through farming or special events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **25% (1/4) or less** of its maximum, the Berry is consumed to raise the Pokémon's **Special Defense by one stage**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Using Fling consumes the berry and applies the +1 Special Defense boost to the *target*).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it deals **Ground-type** damage with a base power of 100 (Gen IV-V) or 80 (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **Niche Competitive Item**. It is most effective on "Sub-Seed" or "Endure" sets designed to force the 25% HP threshold. It synergizes exceptionally well with the **Unburden** ability (e.g., on Drifblim or Sceptile) and the **Ripen** or **Cheek Pouch** abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Activates the **Gluttony** ability early (at 50% HP instead of 25%).
    * Can be used as an ingredient in Pokéblocks or Poffins, typically providing a "Very Bitter" profile for raising the **Smart** contest condition.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game locations such as the Battle Frontier, Berry Master's house, or via specific Berry mutations (notably in Gen VI). In many titles, it is a "rare" berry given by NPCs for high-level accomplishments or via the Pickup ability at very high levels (e.g., Level 91-100 in certain games).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. Players must rely on Berry planting mechanics to increase their stock once a single specimen is acquired. In some generations, it can be obtained by using the move **Thief** or **Covet** on specific trainers in rematch battles.
