## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CYG7528)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item designed for use in the Pokémon Sword and Shield Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is categorized as a single-use event facilitator rather than a standard medicine or held item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; typically not purchasable through standard Marts and acquired via promotional serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair**, the crystal radiates a beam of light, forcing a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Corviknight** (indicated by the internal code *cyg7528*). The raid persists regardless of defeat until the encounter is won or the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item used for out-of-battle encounter generation. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess **Hidden Abilities** or high **Individual Values (IVs)**, making it a valuable tool for breeding competitive-ready Corviknight.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed as a **promotional bonus**, often tied to retail pre-orders (such as the Corviknight serial code distribution) or special events. It is not available through organic gameplay or standard NPC vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is managed via the "Other Items" or "Key Items" pocket depending on the specific game version, though it is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid.
* **World Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent condensed Galar particles, allowing a trainer to summon a Dynamax phenomenon at a dormant Power Spot (the Watchtower Lair) outside of the natural raid rotations.
