## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CRU4763** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area). Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that remains active until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; technically categorized as a cheap item, but it is **Not for Sale** in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty den in the Watchtower Ruins, it summons a specific Pokémon (determined by the crystal's unique ID) for a **Max Raid Battle**. This encounter typically features rare Pokémon, Gigantamax forms, or version-exclusives that may not normally appear in that location.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld. Its competitive value is indirect, as it allows players to capture Pokémon with specific Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors required for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used to facilitate a **Max Raid Encounter**. It is consumed immediately upon the successful activation of the den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event-Exclusive.** Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or GAME) or as bonuses for purchasing the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* Expansion Pass or Dual Pack. They are not found through natural exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a digital distribution item.
