## Identity & Utility
**Stardust** is a **Loot/Valuable Item** introduced in Generation II (with refined data recorded in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A lovely, red sand with a loose, silky feel. It is categorized as "Vendor Trash," meaning it serves no functional purpose in battle or the overworld other than being sold for profit. It is a **Consumable (Sale)** item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Not for sale**). While its internal cost is 3,000, its primary utility is its resale value.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Stardust is used exclusively for currency generation. In standard shops, it typically sells for **1,500 Poké Dollars** (standard 50% rule) or **1,000 Poké Dollars** depending on the specific game version. 
* **Specialist Value:** In certain regions, specialized NPCs (such as the Ore Collector/Item Maniac) will purchase Stardust for a premium price of **2,000 Poké Dollars**, making it more efficient to save for these specific vendors.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats and should not be held by a Pokémon in a competitive setting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is part of a value hierarchy: **Stardust < Star Piece < Comet Shard.**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as a hidden item in beach environments (buried in sand) or crater-like locations (such as Mt. Moon or Meteor Falls).
* **Wild Held Item:** Stardust is frequently held by celestial-themed Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Staryu**, **Starmie**, **Lunatone**, and **Solrock**. 
* **Farming Context:** Trainers often use the abilities **Frisk** (to identify the item) and **Thief** or **Covet** (to steal the item) to farm Stardust for quick cash. It can also be found via the **Pickup** ability at mid-level tiers.
