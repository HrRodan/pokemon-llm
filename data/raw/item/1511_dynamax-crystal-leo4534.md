## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LEO4534** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid boss. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; the nominal value is a placeholder as it is obtained via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the player can use this crystal to activate a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **LEO4534** crystal triggers an encounter with **Jangmo-o** (and its evolutionary line). The encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is a field-use item).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle effect, it is highly valuable for competitive players as Max Raid encounters often yield Pokémon with **High Individual Values (IVs)**, **Hidden Abilities**, and rare **Technical Records (TRs)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically designed to facilitate the acquisition of the Jangmo-o line, which is typically exclusive to *Pokémon Sword*. This crystal allows players (including those on *Pokémon Shield*) to encounter the Pokémon regardless of version.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional bonus. Specifically, LEO4534 was provided via a serial code included with the **Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack** (often referred to as the "Steelbook Edition"). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly digital distribution item.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are crystallized fragments of Galar Energy. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which attract random Pokémon to a den, these specific crystals are "tuned" to the frequency of a particular species, forcing a guaranteed spawn.
