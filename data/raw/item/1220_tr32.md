## Identity & Utility
**TR32 (Crunch)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** It is a single-use teaching device that imparts the move **Crunch** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike the infinite-use TMs of the same generation, this TR is consumed upon use. It is primarily used to provide physical attackers with high-value Dark-type coverage.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive; often purchased using Watts in its debut region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Crunch**. Crunch is a Physical Dark-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 20% chance to lower the target's Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage when thrown using the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** Crunch is the gold standard for Physical Dark-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) or coverage. It is frequently seen on competitive heavy-hitters like **Tyranitar**, **Gyarados**, and **Zacian** to threaten Psychic and Ghost-type opponents.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Not used for evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR32 is not typically found in standard Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 3,000–5,000 Watts (depending on daily rotation) or as a reward for defeating Dark-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured technical record found via Galar's Raid ecosystem.
