## Identity & Utility
**Crabrawler Shell** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological byproduct shed by members of the Crabrawler evolutionary line. As a material categorized under TM-Materials, it is a non-consumable resource in battle but serves as a vital crafting component at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common resource; often converted into League Points (LP)).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, it is combined with League Points (LP) to create powerful moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the crafting economy and does not impact competitive Pokémon builds outside of the initial acquisition of move-teaching TMs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone or a trigger for baby Pokémon. It is primarily used for crafting physical-based moves that align with Crabrawler’s themes, such as **TM089 (Bulk Up)** and **TM110 (Liquidation)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Crabrawler** or **Crabominable**.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item in the traditional sense, it is "gathered" by interacting with wild populations. Crabrawler are frequently found near trees (specifically berry trees) and beach biomes in the Paldea region.
* **Lore:** These shell fragments are tough and durable, reflecting the resilient nature of the Boxing Pokémon. Trainers collect them from the aftermath of territorial bouts between Crabrawler.
