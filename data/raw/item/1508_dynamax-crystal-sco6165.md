## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (sco6165)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-specific Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar).
* **Description:** A specialized single-use item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Once used, the specific Pokémon associated with this crystal will appear as a raid boss until the end of the day. It is a consumable event item that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Placeholder cost; effectively **Not for sale** as it is an event distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive den in the Wild Area’s Watchtower Ruins), it activates a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (the "sco6165" variant historically corresponds to specific retail distributions, such as those for Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax-capable species).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for the overworld. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for providing guaranteed access to high-IV (Individual Value) Pokémon or those with Hidden Abilities, which are essential for breeding competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** or **Mystery Gift** events (often as a pre-order bonus or through retail partnerships like GameStop or Pokémon Center). It is not available through natural gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Acquisition" item, representing a concentrated mass of Galar's Wishing Star energy tailored to attract a specific species.
