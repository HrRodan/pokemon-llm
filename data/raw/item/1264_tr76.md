## Identity & Utility
**TR76 (Stealth Rock)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that teaches the move **Stealth Rock**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic mechanics of move-teaching items for high-value competitive moves.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderate cost; often acquired via Watts in the Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Stealth Rock**. This move sets an entry hazard on the opponent's side of the field. When an opposing Pokémon switches in, they take Rock-type damage based on their type effectiveness:
    * **1x Weakness:** 12.5% Max HP.
    * **2x Weakness:** 25% Max HP.
    * **4x Weakness:** 50% Max HP (e.g., Charizard, Volcarona).
    * **Resistant:** 6.25% or 3.125% Max HP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; not recommended for Fling strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Defining Staple.** Stealth Rock is arguably the most important entry hazard in competitive singles (Smogon). It breaks "Focus Sashes," punishes frequent switching (pivoting), and is a mandatory inclusion on most "Lead" or "Tank" Pokémon (e.g., Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Hippowdon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching tool. In Generation VIII, TRs are often farmed through Max Raid Battles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR76 is primarily obtained as a reward from **Max Raid Battles** involving Rock-type Pokémon. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts, though its inventory rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is an artificial data recording used by trainers to enhance a Pokémon's movepool.
* **Historical Context:** Stealth Rock has transitioned between being a TM (Gen IV), a Move Tutor move (Gen V-VII), and a TR (Gen VIII), reflecting its status as a high-tier utility move that developers periodically restrict or make more difficult to obtain.
