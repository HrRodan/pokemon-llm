## Identity & Utility
**Pokeblock Case** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized storage container designed to hold Pokéblocks—nutritional treats created by mixing Berries in a Berry Blender. It is a **Key Item** and **cannot be bought or sold**. It functions as an essential tool for trainers participating in the Pokémon Contest circuit.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the inventory management system for Pokéblocks. It allows the player to view the quantity and "feel" (density/quality) of their treats. Without this item, a trainer cannot participate in the Berry Blending process or enter Pokémon Contests in the Hoenn region.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as its effects are restricted to the Pokémon Contest sub-game and the Safari Zone.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Contest Stats:** Used to feed Pokémon to raise their Coolness, Beauty, Cuteness, Smartness, and Toughness. This is indirectly required for evolving **Feebas into Milotic** (which requires high Beauty) in original Generation III and IV games.
    * **Safari Zone:** In the Hoenn Safari Zone, the case allows players to place Pokéblocks in "Feeders" to attract wild Pokémon with specific Natures.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained as a gift from an NPC within a **Contest Hall** (commonly found in Slateport City or Lilycove City, depending on the specific game version). In the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire (ORAS) remakes, it is gifted by Lisia.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique tool granted to the player to signify their status as a Pokémon Coordinator.
* **Lore context:** The case is described as releasing a single Pokéblock when shaken, emphasizing its role as a dispenser for treating Pokémon during grooming or before stage performances.
