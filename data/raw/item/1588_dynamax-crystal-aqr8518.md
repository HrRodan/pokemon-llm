## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (AQR8518)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that functions similarly to a Key Item but is categorized under its own unique class for event distributions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inexpensive/Nominal**). While it has a technical cost in the game data, it cannot be purchased from standard Marts; it is exclusively acquired via special promotional codes (serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), it causes a specific Pokémon—typically a version-exclusive or rare encounter—to appear as a Dynamax Raid boss. The raid remains active until 11:59 PM of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no battle effect, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), and reward the player with valuable items like Exp. Candies and TMs/TRs upon defeat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via serial codes, often as a pre-order bonus (such as the Dual Pack bonus) or through retail collaborations (e.g., GameStop/Target promotions). These codes were the only way to obtain these specific crystals.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item that cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or other in-game means.
* **World Knowledge:** The "AQR" prefix in the internal name often corresponds to specific distribution sets. For example, similar crystals (like *★And15* or *★And458*) were used to encounter Larvitar and Jangmo-o in the opposite versions they were native to, helping players complete their Pokédexes without trading.
