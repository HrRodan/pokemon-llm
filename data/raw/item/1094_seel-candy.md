## Identity & Utility
**Seel Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable growth item packed with energy. Unlike standard candies that affect specific stats, this item is tailored to the Seel evolutionary line, increasing all attributes simultaneously. It is a **Consumable** item that is technically purchasable, though its primary acquisition is through gameplay mechanics.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Seel** or **Dewgong**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. In the *Let's Go* series mechanics, these points contribute to **Awakening Values (AVs)**, which can boost each stat by a maximum of 200 points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* titles. Because it uses the AV system rather than the traditional Effort Value (EV) system, it is not used in standard VGC or Smogon formats. Within its own game, however, it is essential for "maxing out" a Pokémon for Master Trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution; it is purely for stat enhancement. It only functions on Seel and its evolution, Dewgong.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Seel Candy cannot be found in traditional Poké Marts across most regions. In the Kanto region of *Let's Go*, it is primarily obtained as a reward for catching Seel or Dewgong, or by "transferring" captured Seel/Dewgong to Professor Oak.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense. Instead, it is gathered through **Catch Combos** (repeatedly catching the same species) or via the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral when taking a Seel for a stroll. It is a primary reward for "farming" the Seel evolutionary line.
