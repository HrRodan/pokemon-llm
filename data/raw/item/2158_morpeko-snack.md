## Identity & Utility
**Morpeko Snack** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting component dropped by the Pokémon Morpeko. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that serves as an ingredient for the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine). It cannot be used directly in the overworld or held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 15 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Low-value sell item; primarily used for crafting or conversion into League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Morpeko Snack is used exclusively at the TM Machine to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). By combining these snacks with League Points (LP) and other materials, trainers can teach new moves to their Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no direct utility in competitive battles (VGC or Smogon). Its value lies entirely in the "preparation" phase of competitive play, allowing trainers to access movesets required for a viable team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not sold at Poké Marts. It is acquired by **defeating or catching wild Morpeko**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item, it is a guaranteed drop from the **Morpeko** line. In the Paldea region's ecosystem (specifically within the Kitakami region of the DLC), Morpeko are the primary source for this material.
* **World Knowledge:** Like other Gen IX materials, the Morpeko Snack represents the "remnants" or "essences" of the Pokémon. In the context of the *Teal Mask* expansion, players must farm these snacks to craft specific TMs that were added to the expanded TM catalog.
