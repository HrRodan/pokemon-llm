## Identity & Utility
**TM09** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation I** (though specific metadata identifies this iteration with Generation III's technical index).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. In its most modern and prominent iteration (Gen V onwards), it teaches the move **Venoshock**. It is a **Consumable/Multi-use** item (depending on the specific game's engine) that **can be bought**.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price tag typically reflects its status as a high-tier TM found in late-game Department Stores or specialized TM shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. The move contained within TM09 has shifted significantly across the franchise's history:
    * **Gen V–IX:** **Venoshock** (Poison-type, Special, 65 Base Power). Its power doubles to 130 if the target is already poisoned.
    * **Gen III–IV:** **Bullet Seed** (Grass-type, Physical, Multi-hit).
    * **Gen II:** **Psych Up** (Normal-type, Status).
    * **Gen I:** **Take Down** (Normal-type, Physical).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard TMs generally cannot be used with Fling or have a negligible power of 10; the provided data lists this as `null`).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * *Venoshock:* A **Niche Synergy** move. It is highly effective in "Toxic Stall" or "Venom Drench" compositions, particularly when paired with **Toxic Spikes**. It is a staple for Poison-type specialists looking to capitalize on status-heavy pressure.
        * *Bullet Seed (Historical):* A **Competitive Staple** for Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (e.g., Breloom), as it breaks Focus Sashes and Substitutes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility. It cannot be used on Pokémon with the ability **Klutz**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired via high-end vendors like the **Lumiose City TM Shop** or **Veilstone Department Store**. In many regions (such as Unova), it is gifted by the Poison-type Gym Leader (e.g., Roxie) to reward the player for mastering status-based strategies.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or Evolution Stones, TMs are artificial human-made disks and are exclusively found as overworld items (Poké Balls on the ground), rewards, or retail purchases.
