## Identity & Utility
**TR09 (Thunder)** is an **All-Machines (Technical Record)** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** It is a single-use teaching device that grants a compatible Pokémon the move **Thunder**, a high-intensity Electric-type attack. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, functioning as a high-value consumable resource for move-set optimization.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While valued at a high price, in its debut generation, it is primarily traded for Watts at Watt Traders or earned through high-tier Raid encounters.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Thunder**. 
    * **Move Stats:** 110 Power / 70% Accuracy / Special Category.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.
    * **Field Synergy:** The accuracy becomes 100% (never-miss) during **Rain** and drops to 50% during **Harsh Sunlight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 110. This is an exceptionally high Fling value, making it one of the most powerful items to use with the move Fling for immediate raw damage, though it consumes the machine.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact Staple.** TR09 is essential for Special Attackers on **Rain Teams** (e.g., Pelipper, Zapdos, Kingdra). Its high base power makes it a preferred choice over Thunderbolt when accuracy can be mitigated or when maximum damage output is required to secure KOs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed after one successful use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR09 is frequently found as a reward for defeating **Electric-type Pokémon** in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts (W), with the stock rotating daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through the Galar region's Max Raid infrastructure or the Cram-o-matic (if using specific recipes in the Isle of Armor).
