## Identity & Utility
**Wing Ball (Lawing-ball)** is a **Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball designed with a lightweight aerodynamic frame. It is the mid-tier upgrade in the Feather Ball family (Feather Ball < Wing Ball < Jet Ball). It is a **Consumable** item used exclusively in the overworld of ancient Hisui for long-distance captures. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In its native game, it is primarily obtained through **Crafting** or purchased at the Jubilife Village general store for 300-600 Poké Dollars rather than found in modern Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When thrown, the Wing Ball travels in a fast, straight line with very little gravity arc, allowing the Trainer to snipe Pokémon from a great distance. It features an increased catch rate against Pokémon that are **flying high in the air** or are otherwise distant.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine without the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusive to the *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* overworld mechanics and cannot be held by Pokémon in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a vital tool for completing Research Tasks related to "catching Pokémon while they are in the air."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Crafting:** Can be crafted using 1 **Apricorn**, 1 **Sky Tumblestone**, and 1 **Iron Chunk**. The recipe is unlocked upon reaching the **Sixth Star Member** rank in the Galaxy Expedition Team.
    * **Purchase:** Sold by the Ginkgo Guild or the Jubilife Village general store once the player has progressed sufficiently in the story.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike modern Poké Balls, these are historical artifacts crafted from natural Hisuian materials.
* **Lore Context:** Before the standardization of Poké Ball technology, the Wing Ball represented a breakthrough in capturing aerial species that were previously unreachable with heavy Lead-type or standard Poké Balls. Its design focuses on velocity over impact force.
