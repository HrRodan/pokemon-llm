## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal OPH6603** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An event-exclusive consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of the Galar region. Once consumed, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but this is a placeholder value as the item is distributed via Serial Code and cannot be bought in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), it causes a beam of light to appear, initiating a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This particular crystal (OPH6603) is associated with the **Gigantamax Orbeetle** encounter.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is used to acquire Pokémon with **Gigantamax Factors**, high IVs, and Hidden Abilities, which are essential for the VGC and Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Max Raid Den** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, this crystal guarantees a specific encounter regardless of the den's natural spawn pool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed as a promotional reward, typically through serial codes provided by retailers (such as the "Best Buy" or "GameStop" promotions) during the *Pokémon Sword & Shield* life cycle. It is not available through regular exploration or the Cram-o-matic.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is managed strictly through the "Other Items" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag until taken to the Watchtower Ruins.
