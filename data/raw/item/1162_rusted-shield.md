## Identity & Utility
**Rusted Shield** is a **Species-Specific** transformation item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An ancient, weathered shield used by a legendary hero to save Galar from the Darkest Day. Despite its "rusted" appearance, it serves as a catalyst for legendary power. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold, functioning as a vital piece of legendary equipment.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; Unique Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Zamazenta**, the Pokémon undergoes a Forme Change from its "Hero of Many Battles" state into its **"Crowned Shield"** form. This transformation occurs immediately upon entering battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Stat Modification:** While transformed, Zamazenta's Base Defense and Special Defense are significantly increased, and its Base Speed is slightly reduced.
    * **Type Change:** Changes Zamazenta’s typing from pure **Fighting** to **Fighting/Steel**.
    * **Move Transformation:** If Zamazenta knows the move **Iron Head**, it is replaced by **Behemoth Bash** during battle, which deals double damage to Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed targets.
    * **Ability Interaction:** Triggers the ability **Dauntless Shield**, which boosts Zamazenta's Defense stat by one stage upon entering the field.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Forme-altering items generally cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Legendary Staple.** This item is mandatory for utilizing Zamazenta in its most defensive and viable form in Ubers or Restricted VGC formats. It provides essential resistances and bulk.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon but is hard-coded to Zamazenta. It cannot be removed via *Knock Off* or stolen via *Thief* if held by Zamazenta.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as part of the post-game story arc in *Pokémon Shield* (or via event/trade in *Pokémon Sword*). It is found deep within the **Slumbering Weald** at the shrine of the legendary heroes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact tied to the Galar region's mythology.
* **Lore:** Legend tells that Zamazenta used this shield alongside Zacian (holding the Rusted Sword) to stop Eternatus and end the disaster known as the Darkest Day. Over millennia, the shield lost its luster until reunited with its rightful master.
