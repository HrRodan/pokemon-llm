## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2216** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area of Galar. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Restricted**; effectively priceless as it is typically obtained via promotional serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty den at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area) with this crystal in their bag, it initiates a **Max Raid Battle**. This allows the player and up to three other participants to challenge a specific Pokémon—historically, the **Gem2216** variant was associated with promotional distributions for **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for "Out-of-Battle" Raid encounters to secure rare Pokémon, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax-capable species.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the Watchtower Lair raid. If the player loses the raid, they can re-challenge it as many times as needed until the day ends.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** as a pre-order bonus or through retail partnerships (such as Amazon, GameStop, or Pokémon Center promotions) during the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* era. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique digital key assigned to specific event distributions to grant early or exclusive access to Gigantamax encounters that might otherwise be difficult to find or version-locked.
