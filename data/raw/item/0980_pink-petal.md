## Identity & Utility
**Pink-petal** is a **Key Item** (Quest Item) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A delicate, pressed flower petal received from the Trial Captain Mina. It is a mandatory quest objective during the Alola Island Challenge in *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is purely progression-based, signifying the start or progress of a specific trial.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Pink Petal serves as a collection component for Mina's Trial. Once the player collects all seven colored petals (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, and Purple) by defeating or interacting with various Trial Captains across Alola, they are combined to create the **Rainbow Flower**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for overworld story progression and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the "Mina's Trial" script. Once the Rainbow Flower is crafted from this and the other petals, it triggers the battle with the **Totem Pokémon Ribombee**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*. It is obtained on **Poni Island** at Seafolk Village.
* **Source:** Given directly to the player by **Captain Mina** at the start of her trial. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, as it is a unique story-related object.
* **Context:** The Pink Petal represents Mina’s specialty in the **Fairy-type**. While the other petals are earned by traveling to meet other captains (like Ilima, Mallow, or Sophocles), the Pink Petal is the anchor of the quest, symbolizing the artistic and free-spirited nature of the Poni Island Trial Captain.
