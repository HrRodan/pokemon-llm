## Identity & Utility
**TR81 (Foul Play)** is a **Machine (Technical Record)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use teaching device used to instruct a Pokémon in the move **Foul Play**. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, TRs are consumed upon use, making them a resource-intensive method of move tutoring. 
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive; typically traded for Watts in-game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Foul Play**. This Dark-type physical move is unique because it calculates damage using the **target's Attack stat** rather than the user's. This makes it devastating against physical sweepers regardless of the user's offensive capabilities.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 95 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** It is an essential tool for defensive Pokémon, supports, and "Prankster" ability users (such as Umbreon, Mandibuzz, or Sableye). It allows naturally weak attackers to deal massive damage to high-Attack opponents, effectively punishing physical set-up sweepers who use moves like Swords Dance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, particularly Dark-types and those with "shady" or "clever" thematic profiles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR81 is primarily obtained by defeating Dark-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price (usually 3,000 - 5,000 Watts). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered through the Galar region's Raid system or via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion by combining specific items.
