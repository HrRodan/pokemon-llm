## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal cru4700** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter that remains active until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Trigger** item that **cannot be bought** via standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**System Value / Not for sale**). While the internal data assigns a nominal cost, this item is exclusively obtained through external serial code distributions (e.g., pre-order bonuses or retail promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific Pokémon Den in the Wild Area), the player can use this item to activate a Max Raid Battle. In the case of code **cru4700**, this typically corresponds to a specialized encounter, most notably **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a standard battle; it is a field-use trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Preparatory.** While the crystal itself has no direct combat utility, the Pokémon captured through these raids often possess **Hidden Abilities**, high individual values (IVs), and the **Gigantamax Factor**, making them highly valuable for building competitive VGC or Smogon teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid** mechanic. It allows players to bypass the randomness of standard Wishing Pieces to secure a specific, often rare, encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional **Serial Code** via participating retailers (such as GameStop or GAME) or as a bonus for purchasing specific Pokémon Sword and Shield expansions/guides. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-exclusive distribution item. 
* **Context:** The "Watchtower Lair" is the only location where these crystals function. Lore-wise, these crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles that can summon a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax entity to a dormant Power Spot.
