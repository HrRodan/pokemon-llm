## Identity & Utility
**Mild-mint** is a **Nature-mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herbal item that, when used, changes a Pokémon's stat growth patterns. Specifically, it aligns the Pokémon's stats with the **Mild** nature, regardless of its original nature. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is generally not available for standard Poké Dollars in most shops, typically requiring specialized currency or endgame access.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Specialized Acquisition**). *Note: While the internal value is 20, these are typically purchased for 50 BP in Battle Towers or 20,000 Poké Dollars in later regions like Paldea.*

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the Pokémon's stat multipliers. It increases the growth rate of **Special Attack** by 10% and decreases the growth rate of **Defense** by 10%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Competitive Staple.** Mints revolutionized the competitive scene by allowing players to "fix" the stats of Legendary, Shiny, or Gift Pokémon that cannot be easily bred. The Mild Mint is specifically used for **Mixed Attackers** who need high Special Attack but prioritize Special Defense over physical Defense.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It strictly affects stat growth. It does **not** change the name of the Pokémon's actual Nature (for the purposes of flavor text or Berry preferences/confusion), only the numerical stat values.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sword/Shield), it is primarily obtained at the **Battle Tower** for Battle Points (BP). In Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), it is more accessible via **Chansey Supply** shops after the player has earned enough Gym Badges, or as a rare drop in high-level Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is an artificial or rare cultivated herb found in high-tier training facilities or as a reward for elite trainers.
