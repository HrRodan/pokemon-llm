## Identity & Utility
**Darkinium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola Region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically attuned to Dark-type energy. When held by a Pokémon that knows a Dark-type move, it allows the use of a powerful Z-Move. As indicated by its "bag" designation and 0 cost, it is a **Key Item / Special Acquisition** that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Quest Reward**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pokémon, it upgrades any **Dark-type damaging move** into the Z-Move **Black Hole Eclipse**. The power of the resulting Z-Move scales based on the base move's original power. 
* **Secondary Mechanics:**
    * **Z-Status Moves:** If the base move is a Status move (e.g., *Memento* or *Dark Void*), using the Z-Power provides a secondary effect (such as fully restoring the HP of the replacement Pokémon) in addition to the move's standard effects.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed or stolen by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* while held in battle.
    * **Battle Attributes:** This item is a **Generation VII exclusive mechanic**. It does not function in games prior to or following the Alola-based titles.
* **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VII).** In the Sun/Moon era, Darkinium Z was frequently used by offensive threats like Hydreigon, Tyranitar, or Krookodile to bypass defensive checks with a one-time high-damage nuke. It was also notable for Z-Parting Shot or Z-Memento strategies to provide momentum and healing.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the Darkinium Z is obtained as a reward for completing the **Ula'ula Island Grand Trial**. It is gifted to the player by **Kahuna Nanu** after he is defeated in battle.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item tied to the player's progress through the Island Challenge. 
* **Lore:** Z-Crystals are fragments of Necrozma's body that fell to Alola in ancient times. The Darkinium Z specifically resonates with the "darkness of the soul," allowing a Trainer and Pokémon to manifest their shared will as a gravitational singularity.
