## Identity & Utility
**Vulpix Candy** is a **Species-Specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized energy-dense candy designed specifically for the Vulpix evolutionary line. It is a consumable medicine that is used from the bag to permanently enhance a Pokémon's potential. It cannot be used on species outside its specific lineage.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Vulpix** or **Ninetales** (including their Alolan regional variants), it increases all of the Pokémon's stats—HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed—simultaneously by 1 Awakening Value (AV).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine where the move Fling is not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/System-Specific. AVs (Awakening Values) are a mechanic unique to the *Let's Go* series. While they provide massive stat boosts for the main story and "No Restrictions" online battles, they are generally excluded from standard competitive formats like VGC or Smogon to maintain traditional stat balance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the "Gold Standard" of the *Let's Go* candy system. Unlike generic candies (Quick Candy, Tough Candy, etc.) which have level requirements and size tiers (S, M, L), a Species Candy has no level restriction and provides a universal stat boost.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Kanto region (LGPE), these are primarily earned by:
    1. **Catching Vulpix:** Achieving "Catch Combos" increases the likelihood of receiving Species Candy.
    2. **Professor Oak:** Transferring multiple Vulpix to the Professor rewards the player with these candies.
    3. **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking with a Vulpix in the physical accessory can generate these as rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an abstraction of "species essence" gathered through training and research. It is most efficiently gathered by players farming Vulpix on Route 5, 6, 7, or 8 (Kanto) or in the Seafoam Islands (Alolan Vulpix trade).
