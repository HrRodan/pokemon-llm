## Identity & Utility
**Ghostium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is the bag-stored representation of the Ghost-type Z-Crystal. It converts Z-Power into crystals that upgrade a Pokémon's Ghost-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Key Item / Special Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one **Ghost-type move**, it allows the use of the Ghost-type Z-Move: **Never-Ending Nightmare**. 
    * If the base move is a damaging move, Never-Ending Nightmare deals massive damage based on the original move's power.
    * If the base move is a status move (e.g., *Confuse Ray* or *Destiny Bond*), it becomes a **Z-Status move**, providing secondary effects such as clearing the user's lowered stats or drawing in attacks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Gen VII Context).** In Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, Ghostium Z was a competitive staple. It allowed Ghost-type attackers like **Mimikyu**, **Aegislash**, and **Marshadow** to bypass defensive checks with a high-damage "nuke." A key property of Z-Crystals is that they **cannot be removed** by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, and they are unaffected by the ability *Sticky Hold*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is required for any Pokémon to access Ghost-type Z-Power. It is specifically bypassed by the ability **Klutz** (the user cannot use the Z-Move) and is ignored if the Pokémon is Mega Evolved or transformed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Alola region, the Ghostium Z is obtained as a reward for completing the **Trial of Acerola** at the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart on Ula'ula Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. As a Z-Crystal, it is a unique item tied to the player's "Z-Ring" or "Z-Power Ring" and cannot be traded to other players if held by a Pokémon.
