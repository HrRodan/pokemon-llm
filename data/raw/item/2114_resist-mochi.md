## Identity & Utility
**Resist Mochi** is a **Vitamin** (Consumable Medicine) introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask).
* **Description:** A specialized snack-like medicine that enhances a Pokémon's performance. It is a consumable item used to increase a Pokémon's base points (Effort Values) in the Defense stat. It is treated as a modern alternative to traditional vitamins like Iron.
* **Cost:** 125 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily obtained through gameplay rewards rather than standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases a Pokémon's **Defense Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. Like other Gen IX vitamins, it can be used until the Pokémon reaches its maximum EV cap (252 in a single stat or 510 total), making it more flexible than the EV-enhancers of older generations that capped at 100.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard for Mochi items).
    * **Competitive Use:** High utility for competitive training. It allows players to precisely tune the bulk of their Pokémon (specifically physical durability) without the need for manual EV grinding through wild battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a stat-enhancement tool. It functions similarly to **Iron** but is often preferred by players who engage in the Kitakami region's activities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for completing various difficulty levels of the **Ogre Oustin'** mini-game in the **Kitakami** region. It can also be obtained through certain auction house rotations or as rewards in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via mini-game performance or as a gift from NPCs in the Kitakami Hall area. Unlike berries, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
