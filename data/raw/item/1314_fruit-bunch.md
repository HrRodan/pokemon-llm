## Identity & Utility
**Fruit Bunch** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A bundle of syrupy, tropical fruits used exclusively as a cooking component during Pokémon Camp. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased from specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 2200 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for specialized cooking ingredients).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Pokémon Camp cooking minigame, it serves as the primary ingredient to create **Fruit Curry**. Depending on the berries added alongside it, the quality can range from Koffing Class to Charizard Class, restoring HP, PP, and increasing the Pokémon's friendliness and Experience Points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect in battle. It is strictly a "Playthrough" or "Nuzlocke" utility item used to heal the party without using traditional medicines.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several region-specific ingredients (Galar) that fill the Curry Dex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained from **Ingredient Sellers** located in the Wild Area (such as those at the Rolling Fields or Hammerlocke Hills). The stock of these NPCs rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike berries, which can be farmed from trees, Fruit Bunches are typically acquired through commerce or as hidden "sparkling" items on the ground in the Galar Wild Area and Expansion Pass zones.
* **World Knowledge:** The Fruit Bunch is associated with the "Sweet" flavor profile. Using it is the only way to register the various "Fruit Curry" entries in the player's Curry Dex.
