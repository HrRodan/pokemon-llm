## Identity & Utility
**TM08** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** that has been a staple in the series since Generation I, though it has taught different moves throughout history. In its most prominent and modern form (introduced in Generation III), it teaches the move **Bulk Up**.

* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. This item allows a Pokémon to learn **Bulk Up**, a non-damaging Fighting-type move. It is a **Consumable** (in most early and very recent generations) or **Infinite Use** (Gens V-VIII) item depending on the specific game's mechanics.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). The high price point reflects its status as a high-tier stat-boosting move often found in late-game Department Stores.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Bulk Up**. When used in battle, Bulk Up raises the user’s **Attack** and **Defense** stats by one stage each (+50% per stage). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Bulk Up is a foundational setup move for "Bulky Sweepers." It allows physical attackers to increase their damage output while simultaneously becoming harder to revenge-kill with physical moves. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like Corviknight, Annihilape, and Great Tusk in Smogon and VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Fighting-types, as well as physically imposing Pokémon from other types (e.g., many Ground, Steel, and Fire types).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Generation III (Hoenn):** Given by Gym Leader Brawly in Dewford Town after earning the Knuckle Badge.
    * **General:** Frequently sold at major **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Lilycove City, or the Battle Frontier) for its premium 50,000 price tag.
    * **Historical Note:** While currently Bulk Up, TM08 taught **Body Slam** in Generation I and **Rock Smash** in Generation II.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM08 is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally found as a stationary item ball on the overworld or purchased via specialized vendors/marts.
