## Identity & Utility
**Wellspring Mask** is a specialized **Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (The Teal Mask DLC).
* **Description:** A mysterious, teal-colored mask imbued with the power of water. It is a **Signature Form-Change Item** specifically designed for the Legendary Pokémon **Ogerpon**. As a unique story-related item, it has no commercial value and cannot be discarded or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item status**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Ogerpon**, it triggers a permanent form change into **Wellspring Mask Ogerpon**. This transformation alters Ogerpon's secondary typing from pure Grass to **Grass/Water**. Additionally, while holding this mask, all of Ogerpon's attacks receive a **1.2x (20%) damage multiplier**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Ability Modification:** In this form, Ogerpon gains the **Water Absorb** ability, granting it an immunity to Water-type moves and healing it upon contact.
    * **Terastal Phenomenon:** If Ogerpon Terastallizes while holding the Wellspring Mask, it becomes a pure **Water-type**. Its ability immediately shifts to **Embody Aspect**, which provides a **+1 Special Defense boost** upon Terastallization.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling, and it cannot be removed from Ogerpon by moves like Knock Off or Thief).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Wellspring Mask Ogerpon is widely considered one of the strongest forms of Ogerpon in VGC and Smogon formats due to its excellent defensive typing, Water Absorb utility, and the bulk provided by the Special Defense boost during Terastallization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon but is mandatory for accessing the specific stats and movepool (Ivy Cudgel becomes Water-type) associated with the Wellspring form.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a fixed story event item during the climax of the **The Teal Mask** expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*. It is retrieved by the player after defeating the Titan Pokémon and progressing through the Kitakami folklore questline.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item; only one exists per save file, and it is never found on wild Pokémon. It cannot be obtained via the Pickup ability.
