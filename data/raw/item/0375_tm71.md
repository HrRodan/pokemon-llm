## Identity & Utility
**TM71 (Technical Machine 71)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** A specialized data disc used to instantly teach a Pokémon a powerful move. While it has historically contained the move **Stone Edge** (Gen IV–VII, Gen IX), it briefly contained **Wonder Room** during the Galar (Gen VIII) cycle. It is a high-value consumable or reusable item depending on the specific region's regulations.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Very Expensive**). This high price point reflects its status as a top-tier offensive tool.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Stone Edge** to a compatible Pokémon. Stone Edge is a premier Physical Rock-type move with 100 Power, 80% Accuracy, and an increased critical-hit ratio.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have negligible power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite Offensive Staple.** In competitive formats (Smogon and VGC), Stone Edge is the standard physical Rock-type coverage for heavy hitters like Tyranitar, Terrakion, and Landorus-T. Despite its notorious 80% accuracy—often joked about as "Stone Miss" in the community—its high base power and crit rate make it essential for checking Flying-type threats like Zapdos or Charizard.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, primarily focusing on Rock, Ground, Fighting, and "Large Monster" archetypes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game locations, such as **Victory Road**, or purchased for a high price at major department stores (e.g., Shopping Mall Nine or the Lilycove Department Store). In the Paldea region, it can be crafted at a TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. TMs are man-made technological artifacts and must be found in the overworld or acquired from Move Tutors and Marts. In most playthroughs, this represents a significant financial investment for the player.
