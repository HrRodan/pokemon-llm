## Identity & Utility
**Watercress** is a Sandwich Ingredient introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A fresh, leafy vegetable with a distinct peppery and bitter profile. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** used exclusively in the Picnic sandwich-making mechanic. It is readily available for purchase and serves as a foundational filling for various recipes.
* **Cost:** 270 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a filling in a sandwich, it modifies the resulting **Meal Powers**. It provides a significant boost to the **Bitter** flavor profile. Depending on the combination of other ingredients, it is frequently used to target **Humungo Power**, **Catching Power**, and **Item Drop Power**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. Its utility is strictly limited to the **overworld/preparation phase**. In a competitive or shiny-hunting context, it is used to craft sandwiches that increase the odds of finding specific Pokémon types or sizes (e.g., increasing the encounter rate of Flying-type Pokémon in certain recipes).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts solely with the **Picnic** mini-game mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Can be purchased at **Deli Cioso** shops located throughout the Paldea region (such as those in Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). It usually becomes available after the player has earned at least three Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is sourced exclusively through retail vendors within the Paldean economy.
