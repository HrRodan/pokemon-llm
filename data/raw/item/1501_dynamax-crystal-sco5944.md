## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO5944** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Galar. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. As a member of the "Dynamax Crystal" category, it functions as a localized encounter-trigger rather than a traditional held item or medicine.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap; however, this is a nominal value as the item is typically acquired via external promotional codes and is **not for sale** in standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), a pillar of light is produced. This triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. Based on the "SCO5944" designation (associated with the Japanese Pokémon Secret Member Club), this crystal specifically triggers an encounter with **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of catching Pokémon. It is highly valued in playthroughs for providing early or guaranteed access to a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, defeat of the raid boss allows the player to attempt to catch a Pokémon that would otherwise require high-tier raid luck or late-game progress.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **Promotional/Event item**. It was originally distributed via serial code to members of the "Pokémon Secret Member Club" in Japan who pre-ordered *Pokémon Sword* or *Pokémon Shield*. It cannot be found through normal gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is a "Key-like" consumable that is removed from the Bag upon successful activation at the Watchtower Lair.
* **Lore Context:** The SCO series of crystals represents some of the earliest Gigantamax encounters made available to players, serving as a bridge between the base game experience and the specialized Max Raid mechanics.
