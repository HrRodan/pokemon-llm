## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Def 2** is a **Miracle Shooter (Wonder Launcher)** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An upgraded variant of the standard X Special Defense. It is a specialized, consumable battle-only item that sharply boosts defensive capabilities. Unlike standard items, it is tied exclusively to the Wonder Launcher mechanic and cannot be used from the bag in standard overworld or traditional battle scenarios.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via point accumulation during Wonder Launcher battles).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a battle via the Wonder Launcher, it raises the target Pokémon's **Special Defense stat by two stages (+2)**. This effect is lost if the Pokémon is withdrawn from battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is restricted to the "Wonder Launcher" sub-format of Generation V. Because standard VGC and Smogon formats prohibit the use of items from the Bag/Launcher during matches, this item has no presence in the competitive meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on Pokémon evolution and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it cannot be "held."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to **Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2**. It is not found in Poké Marts. Instead, it is "purchased" dynamically during a battle using 5 points generated by the Wonder Launcher system.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital/mechanical construct of the Unova region's advanced battle technology rather than a physical medicinal item found in nature.
