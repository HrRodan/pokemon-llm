## Identity & Utility
**Squawkabilly Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Parrot Pokémon, Squawkabilly. It is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, these feathers are essential for creating moves associated with Squawkabilly’s biological traits, such as high-speed maneuvers or wind-based support.
    * **Specific TMs:** Used to craft **TM060 (U-turn)**, **TM097 (Fly)**, **TM113 (Tailwind)**, and **TM164 (Brave Bird)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used as a held item in battle; has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** (Directly). However, it is vital for the "pre-game" competitive loop, as it allows players to teach meta-relevant moves like *U-turn* and *Tailwind* to their roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Squawkabilly**. They are commonly found in grassy areas and urban environments early in the Paldean journey.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "Held Item," it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Squawkabilly** (all colors: Green, Blue, Yellow, and White Plumage). It is best gathered by using the **"Let's Go!" Auto-Battle** feature to quickly clear groups of wild birds.
