## Identity & Utility
**Tauros Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clump of hair dropped by a Tauros. It is a consumable crafting material used primarily at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a non-holdable item specifically designed for the crafting economy of the Paldea region.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard material value; typically exchanged for 100 League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, players must combine Tauros Hair with League Points (LP) to create moves such as:
    * **TM001 (Take Down)**
    * **TM006 (Scary Face)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in active combat; its value is entirely foundational, allowing players to teach competitive moves to their team via crafting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Tauros. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item," it is dropped by:
    * **Kantonian Tauros** (in applicable Paldean biomes/events).
    * **Paldean Tauros** (Combat Breed, Blaze Breed, and Aqua Breed).
* **Context:** In the ecology of the Paldea region, materials like Tauros Hair represent the gathering-and-crafting loop introduced to streamline move accessibility. It reflects the rugged nature of the Wild Bull Pokémon.
