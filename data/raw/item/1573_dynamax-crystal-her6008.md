## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal HER6008** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that is not found in standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically priced as **Cheap**, but it is an event-exclusive item and cannot be purchased from standard Poke Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell area of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Gigantamax-capable Pokémon—specifically **Sandaconda**—to appear in a Max Raid Battle. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in the Fling move).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for encounter generation. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for providing a guaranteed path to a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was a central mechanic in Gen VIII VGC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanics of the Galar Wild Area. Unlike standard Raids, the encounter triggered by this crystal is unique to the player who uses it and can be attempted multiple times until defeated or until the daily timer expires.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-only item**. Dynamax Crystal HER6008 was primarily distributed via serial codes through various retail partnerships (such as GameStop or Micromania) during special promotional periods for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via the **Mystery Gift** function.
* **Lore context:** The "HER" prefix in the name refers to the internal coding for specific event distributions. These crystals represent a concentrated form of Galar's Wishing Stars, stabilized to summon a specific powerful entity to a dormant Power Spot.
