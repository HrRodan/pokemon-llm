## Identity & Utility
**Custap Berry** is a specialized **In-a-pinch Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A rare berry designed for high-stakes battle scenarios. It is a **Holdable Consumable** that triggers when the user's health is critically low. While it can technically be sold, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible by price, though its actual availability is usually limited to special events or late-game battle facilities).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **1/4 (25%) or less** of its maximum, the Berry is consumed. On the very next turn, the holder is guaranteed to move first within its specific priority bracket, effectively bypassing the Speed stat for one turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; not recommended for use with Fling).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with Natural Gift, it becomes a **Ghost-type** move with **100 Base Power** (Gen VI+) or 80 Base Power (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple** for "Suicide Leads" and certain wall-breakers. It is frequently paired with the **Sturdy** ability or the move **Endure** to ensure the Pokémon survives at 1 HP, allowing it to use a high-impact move (like *Explosion*, *Stealth Rock*, or *Destiny Bond*) first on the following turn regardless of the opponent's Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts specifically with abilities like **Gluttony** (which allows the berry to be eaten at 50% HP instead of 25%) and **Harvest** or **Recycle**, which can allow the user to regain the priority-boosting effect multiple times.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, the Custap Berry is one of the rarest berries in the franchise, often restricted to **Event Distributions**, high-tier rewards in **Battle Frontiers/Subways**, or specific late-game mechanics like the **Dream World** or **Poke Pelago**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It must typically be obtained through special NPC trades, berry masters, or internal game events. Its rarity in the "wild" reinforces its status as a tactical tool for advanced trainers rather than a common medicinal fruit.
