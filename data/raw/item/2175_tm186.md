## Identity & Utility
**TM186 (High Horsepower)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **High Horsepower**. In the Generation IX system, TMs are single-use but can be manufactured using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable/Machine** item that cannot be purchased with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; requires League Points (LP) and materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **High Horsepower** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** High Horsepower is a powerful **Ground-type Physical move** with 95 Base Power and 95% Accuracy. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier / Staple.** High Horsepower is a premium Ground-type coverage move for physical attackers. In **VGC (Doubles)**, it is often preferred over Earthquake because it is a single-target move, allowing the user to deal massive damage to an opponent without hitting their own ally. It is commonly used by Pokémon like Rillaboom, Mamoswine, and Ursaluna.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time use item per craft, though it can be recreated infinitely as long as the player has the necessary materials.

    * **Crafting:** Can be manufactured at any TM Machine using **8,000 LP**, **5 Mudbray Mud**, **3 Phanpy Nails**, and **3 Hippopotas Sand**.
    * **Location:** Found as a collectible item in the overworld within the **Terarium (Blueberry Academy)** during the *Indigo Disk* DLC events, or rewarded through specific NPC interactions in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials for crafting are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Mudbray**, **Phanpy**, and **Hippopotas** (often optimized via the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature).
