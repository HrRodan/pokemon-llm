## Identity & Utility
**Medichamite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to bridge the bond between Trainer and Pokémon. It is a **Held Item** that enables a specific transformation in battle. It cannot be bought or sold at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically acquired through exploration or post-game events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Medicham, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** during battle, transforming it into **Mega Medicham**. This process grants a significant increase to its Attack and Speed stats and retains the devastating **Pure Power** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. While it can be used with Fling, doing so is counter-productive as it consumes the stone and prevents Mega Evolution for the remainder of the match.
    * **Mechanic Immunity:** As a Mega Stone, it cannot be removed from Medicham by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, nor can it be traded away via *Trick* or *Switcheroo* if held by the correct species.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Wallbreaker.** In competitive formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as Smogon National Dex or Gen VII OU), Medichamite is mandatory for Medicham. Mega Medicham is feared for its "Pure Power" boosted High Jump Kick, which can OHKO a vast majority of the metagame.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to the Medicham evolutionary line. It does not trigger a permanent evolution but rather a temporary, battle-only form change.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in significant spiritual or high-altitude locations. In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is found in Laverre City; in *Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, it is located on the exterior of Mt. Pyre. In later generations (Gen VII), it is often purchased using Battle Points (BP) at the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that must be discovered by the player or gifted by NPCs. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability.
