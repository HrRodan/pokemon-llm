## Identity & Utility
**Poison Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** (Specialized Enhancement Item) introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized fragment of Tera Jewel energy. It is a consumable resource used to manipulate the Terastal phenomenon. Unlike standard held items or medicines, it functions as a crafting/service currency used to alter a Pokémon's core competitive attributes.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; however, its value is significantly higher than its sell price due to the grind required to accumulate the necessary quantity for use).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Poison Tera Shards are collected, they can be exchanged at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon's **Tera Type to Poison**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High / Meta-Defining.** Tera Shards are essential for high-level VGC and Smogon formats. Changing to a **Poison Tera Type** is a popular defensive maneuver, allowing a Pokémon to gain resistances to Fairy, Fighting, and Grass while becoming immune to the **Toxic** status condition and removing **Toxic Spikes** upon entry (if the Pokémon becomes grounded). It is frequently used on defensive anchors like Garganacl or Ting-Lu to flip their weaknesses.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used to modify the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic. It is not affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way during battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily earned as rewards for defeating **Poison-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star or higher). They are also found as rare sparkling pickups in the overworld of Paldea, particularly within the **Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero)** and the **Tagtree Thicket**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In the *Indigo Disk* DLC, these can be farmed efficiently using the **Item Printer** in the League Club Room, where they are produced as a byproduct of processing Pokémon materials.
