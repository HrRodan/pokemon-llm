## Identity & Utility
**TM99** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation VI**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. According to its current iteration (Gen VIII onwards), it teaches the move **Breaking Swipe**, a Dragon-type physical attack where the user swings its tail to strike multiple opponents. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** (depending on the specific game version) teaching tool that **Can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Breaking Swipe** (formerly **Dazzling Gleam** in Gen VI-VII). 
    * *Move Effect:* Deals physical damage and provides a guaranteed 100% chance to lower the Attack stat of all targets hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot effectively be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility in Doubles/VGC.** Breaking Swipe is a staple support move in competitive doubles because it hits both opposing Pokémon and reduces their physical damage output simultaneously, providing excellent board control.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited to Pokémon with the biological capability to perform the move (generally those with tails or draconic traits).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available for purchase at Pokémon Centers, TMs Marts, or craftable via the TM Machine in Paldea (Gen IX) using specific Pokémon materials. Its low price point of 1000 makes it an easily mass-produced utility item.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or certain Hold Items, TMs are artificial human-made devices and must be found in the overworld or purchased from vendors.
