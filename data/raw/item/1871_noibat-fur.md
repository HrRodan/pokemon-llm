## Identity & Utility
**Noibat Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX**.
* **Description:** A tuft of fur shed by Noibat. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used exclusively at TM Machines in the Paldea region. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for a passive effect.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). At a TM Machine, players exchange this material along with League Points (LP) to create permanent move-teaching items. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it has no utility in active competitive matches (VGC or Smogon). However, it is essential for the "Prep-Phase" of competitive play, as it is required to craft high-value moves for a team's movepool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource tied to the **Noibat** and **Noivern** evolutionary line.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a reward after defeating or catching wild Noibat or Noivern. It can also be obtained as a reward from Tera Raid Battles involving these species.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Noibat** and **Noivern**. Players typically farm this material in mountainous or cave biomes where Noibat colonies reside to mass-produce TMs such as *Air Slash* or other Flying/Dragon-type maneuvers.
