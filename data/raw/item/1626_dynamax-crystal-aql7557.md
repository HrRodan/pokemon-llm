## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQL7557** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, single-use event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. By offering it at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, a specific Pokémon will appear for the player to challenge. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through traditional in-game means.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal placeholder cost**; typically distributed via serial codes rather than sold in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell area of the Wild Area), it forces a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal variable in its description). The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no effect in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for the overworld to facilitate the acquisition of specific Pokémon, often those with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax forms.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is functionally a "Raid Trigger" that bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces at the specific Watchtower location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a **Promotional Item**. These specific crystals (designated by alphanumeric codes like AQL7557) were historically tied to retail distributions (such as GameStop or Best Buy), pre-order bonuses, or magazine inserts (like CoroCoro). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is an external tool provided to the Trainer via Mystery Gift or special event distribution and cannot be farmed using abilities like **Pickup** or **Thief**.
