## Identity & Utility
**Shadow Mail** is a **Messaging Item (Mail)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A decorative stationery item featuring a "cute Duskull print." It is a consumable messaging tool that can be held by a Pokémon to facilitate communication between players. Once a message is written, it becomes a held item that persists through trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a custom message from a preset list of vocabulary. When held by a Pokémon, this message is sent to another player during a trade. The recipient can read the message, store it in their PC, or erase it to make the stationery reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Item Protection:** While a Pokémon is holding Shadow Mail, it **cannot be placed into a PC Box**. Additionally, the item is "sticky"—moves that remove or steal items (such as *Thief*, *Covet*, *Knock Off*, or *Trick*) will **automatically fail** against the holder.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically used as a niche "anti-meta" choice in older generations to prevent a Pokémon from losing its item to *Knock Off* or *Trick*, though it offers no statistical or tactical benefits otherwise. In modern titles, Mail has largely been phased out or replaced by more functional items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely functional for social interaction and item-loss prevention.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Pokémon Marts in the Hoenn and Kanto (FireRed/LeafGreen) regions. Its low price point makes it an easy-to-acquire aesthetic collectible for fans of Ghost-type Pokémon like Duskull.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased by the Trainer or received via trade from another player.
* **Lore:** Shadow Mail represents the social era of the Game Boy Advance, where physical trading via Link Cable was the primary method of player interaction, allowing Trainers to leave "calling cards" for one another.
