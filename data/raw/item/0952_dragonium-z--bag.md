## Identity & Utility
**Dragonium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (categorized here as a Bag/Key Item) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade Dragon-type moves. In the bag, it serves as the permanent source of the crystal that can be "given" to multiple Pokémon. It is a **Key Item/Z-Crystal** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a **Dragon-type move**, and the Trainer possesses a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring, it allows the use of the Dragon-type Z-Move: **Devastating Drake**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Gen VII Specialist).** In Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon, Dragonium Z was a premier competitive choice for Dragon-type wallbreakers (like Garchomp or Kommo-o) to bypass defensive checks with a one-time high-damage nuke. 
    * **Immunity:** As a Z-Crystal, it cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, and cannot be swapped via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone. However, it is essential for specific Pokémon to maximize their offensive presence in the Alola-region games. It interacts with the **Z-Power Ring** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the main story in the Alola region. Specifically, it is typically found at the **Vast Poni Canyon** on Poni Island after completing the trial of the Dragon-type Totem Pokémon (Totem Kommo-o).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind treasure representing the bond between the Trainer, the Pokémon, and the Alola region's natural power.
* **Semantic Note:** This specific entry (`dragonium-z--bag`) refers to the item as it exists in the player's permanent inventory, which acts as the "master" copy from which the held item version is derived for party members.
