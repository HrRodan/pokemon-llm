## Identity & Utility
**TM59** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. In its debut (Gen IV), it taught **Dragon Pulse**, while in subsequent generations (Gen V–VI), it transitioned to teaching **Incinerate**. It is a **Consumable/Multi-use** item (depending on the generation) that is generally available for purchase or found in high-tier locations.
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Expensive**). This high price point typically categorizes it as a late-game luxury purchase, often found in Department Stores or high-level TM shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. 
    * **Dragon Pulse (Gen IV):** A powerful, reliable Special Dragon-type move with 85–90 base power and no negative side effects.
    * **Incinerate (Gen V–VI):** A Fire-type move that destroys the target's held Berry or Gem, making it unusable for the remainder of the battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Dragon Pulse:** Historically a competitive staple for Special Attackers (like Latios or Hydreigon) seeking consistent Dragon-type coverage without the Special Attack drop of Draco Meteor.
        * **Incinerate:** Primarily a niche utility move used in lower tiers or VGC to disrupt opponents relying on Sitrus Berries or Type-resist Berries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, particularly Dragon-types (for Dragon Pulse) or Fire-types/draconic Pokémon (for Incinerate).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Gen IV:** Found at the **Victory Road** or purchased at the **Veilstone Department Store**.
    * **Gen V–VI:** Often found in the overworld (e.g., **Relic Castle** in B/W or **Route 14** in X/Y).
    * The move taught by TM59 changed significantly in Generation VII to **Brutal Swing**, though the provided data emphasizes the transition from Dragon Pulse to Incinerate.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon; TMs are man-made devices. Unlike Berries or Evolution Stones, they cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
