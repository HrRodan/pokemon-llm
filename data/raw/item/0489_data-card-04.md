## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 04** is a **Data Card** (Key Item/Collectible) introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically within *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** This item serves as a specialized storage device for tracking specific athletic achievements. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon. It is used exclusively to view historical performance metrics within the Pokéathlon system.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale** for standard currency; acquired via Athlete Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the cumulative number of times the Trainer’s Pokémon have performed a **jump** during Pokéathlon events (such as Hurdle Dash, Pennant Capture, or Disc Catch).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has zero utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. Its value is strictly limited to the Pokéathlon mini-game completion and stat-tracking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it stays in the Key Items pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (located north of Goldenrod City in the Johto region). It is typically purchased from the **Athlete Shop** using **Athlete Points (AP)** earned by competing in events. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability. It is a unique record-keeping tool tied to the player's save profile.
* **Context:** Data Cards were a feature designed to provide "completionist" depth to the Pokéathlon, allowing players to track their progress across 27 different statistical categories. Card 04 specifically highlights the "Jump" stat, which is a primary attribute for several Pokéathlon events.
