## Identity & Utility
**Ghost Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystalline shard that glows with a spooky, translucent purple light. It is a specialized **Consumable Resource** used specifically to manipulate a Pokémon's Terastal phenomenon. While it has a nominal value, it is not a standard "Held Item" used for immediate stat boosts, but rather a currency for permanent modification.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Moderate value; primarily acquired through gameplay rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Ghost Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon’s **Tera Type to Ghost**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively used with Fling in a competitive context).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Significance.** Changing a Pokémon to a Ghost Tera Type is a premier defensive strategy used to gain immunity to Normal and Fighting-type moves (such as Extreme Speed or Close Combat). It is also used offensively by Ghost-type attackers to gain a 2x STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) on powerful moves like Shadow Ball or Astral Barrage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the **Terastal** mechanic. It interacts indirectly with the move **Tera Blast**, which becomes a Ghost-type move upon Terastallization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for completing **Tera Raid Battles** (specifically against Ghost-type Raid Bosses). They can also be found as sparkling overworld pickups in the **Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero)** or earned via the **Academy Ace Tournament** and **Ogre Oustin'** minigame.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. This item is gathered through environmental exploration and raid participation rather than through the **Pickup** ability or "Thief" mechanics.
