## Identity & Utility
**Bridge Mail D** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** This stationery features an illustration of a bright-red drawbridge, specifically modeled after the **Driftveil Bridge** (also known as the Charizard Bridge) in the Unova region. It is a **Consumable/Social** item that can be bought at specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message using a predetermined list of words and attach it to a Pokémon. This message is then delivered to another player upon trading the Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically used as a **niche defensive utility**. While held, the Pokémon **cannot be placed in the PC**, and more importantly, moves that remove or swap items—such as **Knock Off, Thief, Covet, Trick, and Switcheroo**—will automatically fail. This makes the holder immune to item-disruption strategies, though at the cost of not being able to hold a performance-enhancing item like a Life Orb or Leftovers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used for social communication and item-loss prevention. Once the message is erased by the recipient, the item is consumed/cleared.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Unova), it is typically purchased from the **Bridge Mail Vendor** located on the **Marvelous Bridge**. It is part of a thematic set of stationery representing the five major bridges of Unova (Village, Skyarrow, Smile/Marvelous, Driftveil, and Tubeline).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. 
* **Regional Context:** The "D" in Bridge Mail D stands for **Driftveil**, highlighting the red suspension bridge that connects Driftveil City to Route 5. In later generations, Mail items were largely phased out of the main series games in favor of expanded online communication features.
