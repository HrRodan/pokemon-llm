## Identity & Utility
**TM166 (Electro Shot)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Electro Shot**. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is primarily acquired through crafting or as a reward within the Blueberry Academy Terarium.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Electro Shot**, a high-power Electric-type Special move.
    * **Move Power:** 130
    * **Accuracy:** 100%
    * **Mechanic:** The user gathers electricity on the first turn, raising its **Special Attack** by one stage, and attacks on the second turn. If it is **raining**, the move skips the charging turn and attacks immediately.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs in Generation IX cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier / Staple.** This TM is essential for **Archaludon**, its signature user. In VGC (Double Battles) and Smogon formats, it is a cornerstone of "Rain Teams," allowing Archaludon to output massive damage and gain offensive boosts instantly under Pelipper's Drizzle ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While not an evolution item, this move is the defining characteristic of **Archaludon** (the evolution of Duraludon), emphasizing its role as a bridge between defensive typing and offensive pressure.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found in the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy. Once obtained, it can be replicated at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To craft TM166, the player typically requires:
    * 10,000 LP
    * 5x Duraludon Tarnish
    * 3x Magnemite Screws
    * 3x Tynamo Slime
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. The materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating wild **Duraludon**, **Magnemite**, and **Tynamo** lines.
