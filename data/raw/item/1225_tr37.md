## Identity & Utility
**TR37 (Technical Record 37: Taunt)** is a **Technical Record (Move Teaching Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use teaching item that imparts the move **Taunt** to a compatible Pokémon. Once used, the record is consumed and disappears from the inventory. It is specifically designed for high-utility tactical expansion of a Pokémon's movepool.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (or equivalent in Watts). It is a **Moderate Investment** item, typically purchased from Watt Traders in the Wild Area rather than standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a compatible Pokémon, it teaches the move **Taunt**. Taunt is a Dark-type status move that prevents the target from using any non-damaging moves (Status moves) for three turns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling with this item provides negligible damage and no secondary effect, making it a poor choice for Fling-based strategies.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite Competitive Staple.** The move taught by TR37 (Taunt) is one of the most important tactical moves in both VGC (Doubles) and Smogon (Singles) formats. It is the primary tool used to shut down "Stall" teams, prevent the opponent from setting up hazards (like Stealth Rock), and stop recovery moves or Trick Room.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time consumable move-teaching mechanic, distinct from the infinite-use TMs (Technical Machines) found in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR37 is primarily acquired in **Pokémon Sword & Shield**. It is most commonly obtained by exchanging **Watts** with **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area. The inventory of these traders rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. However, it is frequently rewarded to players for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles**, specifically against Dark-type Pokémon or high-star difficulty encounters.
* **Lore Context:** Technical Records represent a "return to form" of the original single-use TM mechanic from earlier generations, used for more powerful or competitively significant moves in the Galar region.
