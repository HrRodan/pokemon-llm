## Identity & Utility
**Sitrus Berry** is a **medicine (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A consumable Berry that functions as a mid-to-high-tier healing item. It is a **holdable-active** item that can be used manually from the bag or held by a Pokémon for automatic reactive healing. It represents a significant upgrade over the Oran Berry, transitioning from flat HP restoration to percentage-based scaling.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap; though typically acquired via foraging/growth rather than retail).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores **1/4 (25%) of the Pokémon’s maximum HP**. 
    * **Held Mechanism:** Automatically consumed when the holder’s HP drops to **50% or below**.
    * **Manual Use:** Can be used on a party Pokémon to restore 1/4 max HP instantly outside of or during battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Target receives the 1/4 HP healing effect upon being hit).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it deals **Psychic-type** damage with 60 Base Power (80 BP in Generations IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple**. It is frequently used in VGC (Doubles) and Smogon formats on bulky attackers and support Pokémon to avoid specific 2HKOs (two-hit knock-outs). It is particularly powerful when paired with abilities like **Harvest** (for infinite recycling), **Ripen** (to double the healing to 50%), or **Unburden** (to boost Speed upon consumption).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution but is a primary target for the **Pickup** ability and interacts with HP-check abilities like **Gluttony** (though Sitrus triggers at 50%, whereas Pinch Berries require Gluttony to trigger early).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry trees across all regions (Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, etc.). In many titles, it is the highest tier of "standard" HP-restoring Berries before moving into "Pinch Berry" territory (like Figy or Magost).
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently carried by "Regional Rodent" evolutions and common mammals, including **Raticate, Furret, Linoone, Bibarel,** and **Audino**. It is often farmed by players using the **Pickup** ability or the move **Thief** on these wild encounters.
