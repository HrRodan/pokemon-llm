## Identity & Utility
**Aerodactylite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to interact with the Life Force of a specific Pokémon. When held by an Aerodactyl, it triggers a transformation into Mega Aerodactyl during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Held Evolution Item** that **cannot be purchased** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). As a Mega Stone, it is treated as a high-value treasure or Key Item-adjacent property that is generally found through exploration or gifted by NPCs rather than traded as a commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers **Mega Evolution**. In battle, it allows Aerodactyl to transform into Mega Aerodactyl, significantly increasing its Attack, Defense, Special Defense, and Speed stats. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Ability Change:** Upon Mega Evolution, Aerodactyl’s ability changes to **Tough Claws**, which increases the power of contact moves by 30%.
    * **Fling Power:** 80. While it has a respectable base power for the move Fling, using it is highly discouraged as it consumes the stone and prevents Mega Evolution for the remainder of the encounter.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility/Sweeper.** Mega Aerodactyl is a premier "Speed Tier" benchmark in competitive formats (like Smogon's UU or Gen 7 OU). It functions as a powerful revenge killer and cleaner, utilizing its 150 base Speed and Tough Claws-boosted moves like *Wing Attack*, *Iron Head*, and the elemental fangs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Aerodactyl. It does not disappear after use in battle, but only one Pokémon per team may Mega Evolve per match. It is unaffected by effects that steal or remove held items (like Thief, Covet, or Knock Off) once the Mega Evolution has been triggered.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through endgame content or specific side-quests. 
    * In **X/Y**, it is obtained in Ambrette Town from a scientist in the Fossil Lab. 
    * In **Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon**, it is purchased at the Battle Tree for Battle Points (BP).
    * In **Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee**, it is purchased from the Stone Salesman at the Pokémon League.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard evolutionary stones, Mega Stones are unique artifacts and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild ancient Pokémon.
