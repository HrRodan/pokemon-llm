## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (pav7790)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a technical price in the code, it is functionally priceless as it is typically obtained via serial code or special promotion rather than a Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the empty Watchtower Lair den, a pillar of red light appears, spawning a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. The "pav7790" variant specifically targets **Gigantamax Corviknight**. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate a specific encounter. It provides an opportunity to catch a Pokémon with its Hidden Ability or Gigantamax Factor, which may then be used in competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a single-use item; once the crystal is used to activate the den, the item is removed from the Bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** as a promotional bonus (notably through various retail partnerships or pre-order bonuses for the Sword & Shield expansions). It cannot be found in the wild or purchased from Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized under "Other Items" or "Treasures" depending on the specific game version's bag sorting, but it acts as a **Key Item-adjacent consumable** for the Galar Wild Area mechanics.
