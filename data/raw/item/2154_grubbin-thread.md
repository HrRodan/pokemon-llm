## Identity & Utility
**Grubbin Thread** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Grubbin evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon, but serves as a resource for the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine).
* **Cost:** 25 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low sell value, its primary "currency" value is found in the League Points (LP) and material requirements for crafting specific TMs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at TM Machines to craft various Technical Machines. It has no direct effect on stats, health, or status when held or used from the bag.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly a crafting resource and provides no tactical advantage in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. It is essentially "bag filler" until used at a Pokémon Center.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone and does not trigger evolution. It is not compatible with abilities like Pickup or Klutz for any unique mechanical benefit beyond its base identity as a material.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching members of the Grubbin evolutionary line in the wild. It is primarily found in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy) or specific regions where Grubbin is native.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item; rather, it is a guaranteed or high-probability **drop** upon the conclusion of a battle with wild **Grubbin**, **Charjabug**, or **Vikavolt**. It is commonly farmed by players looking to mass-produce TMs such as *X-Scissor* or other Bug/Electric-type moves associated with this Pokémon family.
