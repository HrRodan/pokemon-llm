## Identity & Utility
**Reset-Urge** is a **Miracle-shooter** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** A specialized battle-only consumable designed for use within the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic. It is used to clear stat modifications from an ally. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that **cannot** be bought with standard currency or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; it is acquired via points accumulated during specialized battles).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during a battle, it selects another friendly Pokémon at random and removes all of its stat changes (resetting Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion to stage 0).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a specialized sub-menu and cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** format in Generation V. Because standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon) prohibit the use of Bag items, Reset-Urge is restricted to casual or specific local wireless battles utilizing the Launcher mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It functions similarly to the move **Haze**, but is targeted specifically at a friendly ally to clear negative stat drops (e.g., drops from using *Draco Meteor* or *Close Combat*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Only accessible during Link Battles (Multiplayer) when the **Wonder Launcher** setting is turned on. Players earn points each turn and "buy" the item mid-combat to use it immediately. It does not persist in the player's permanent inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon; it is a digital construct of the Unova region's advanced battle technology.
