## Identity & Utility
**Eevee Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of soft fur shed by an Eevee. It is a consumable crafting reagent used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create TMs. Unlike traditional items, it is not used directly on a Pokémon but serves as a currency-like resource for move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In-game, these materials are often exchanged for League Points (LP) or used as specific ingredients.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a necessary ingredient for crafting specific TMs at Pokémon Centers. Specifically, it is required to craft TMs such as **TM011 (Water Pulse)**, **TM027 (Aerial Ace)**, and others associated with Eevee's versatile move pool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item cannot be held in battle and provides no statistical or tactical advantage. It is strictly a progression and customization tool for the single-player campaign and team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "TM Materials" pocket, distinguishing it from Held Items or Medicine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild members of the Eevee evolutionary line after being defeated or caught. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a traditional held item. Instead, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Eevee**. In the Paldea region, farmers and trainers gather these materials as part of the regional crafting economy. It is most efficiently gathered by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where Eevee spawns, such as the outskirts of Cortondo or Medali.
