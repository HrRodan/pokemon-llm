## Identity & Utility
**Dragonium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power designed to interface with a Trainer's Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring. It is a **Special Held Item** that is not consumed upon use, allowing a Pokémon to tap into powerful Z-Move energy once per battle. It **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a Dragon-type move, it allows the use of the Dragon-type Z-Move: **Devastating Drake**. 
    * If the base move is an **attacking move**, Devastating Drake deals massive damage based on the base move's power.
    * If the base move is a **status move** (e.g., Dragon Dance), it converts it into a **Z-Status move**, adding secondary effects (e.g., Z-Dragon Dance clears the user's lowered stats before applying the standard Dragon Dance boosts).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals **cannot be used with Fling**, nor can they be removed from a Pokémon in battle via *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017-2019 and Smogon SM). It was frequently used on powerful Dragon-types like **Garchomp**, **Dragonite**, and **Kommo-o** to secure one-hit knockouts (OHKOs) against bulky threats that would otherwise survive a standard attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It requires the Trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** to function. It is ignored by the ability *Klutz* (the user can still use the Z-move) and cannot be intercepted by *Embargo* or *Magic Room*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, the player receives this crystal at the **Vast Poni Canyon** after defeating the Totem Pokémon (Kommo-o). In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained during **Mina's Trial**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique, key-item-adjacent tool awarded only to Trainers who complete specific Alolan trials. It cannot be traded to games outside of the Seventh Generation.
