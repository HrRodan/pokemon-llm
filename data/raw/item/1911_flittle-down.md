## Identity & Utility
**Flittle Down** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by Flittle and its evolution. It is a consumable crafting reagent used specifically at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that cannot be bought from standard Poke Marts, though it can be exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars/LP (**Cheap/Common Reagent**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component in the crafting recipes for various Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points and other materials, it allows the player to "print" specific move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials cannot be held by Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios. Its value is strictly limited to out-of-battle move pool customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag rather than the "Items" or "Held Items" pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Flittle evolutionary line. It is a standard progression resource in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item, it is consistently dropped by wild **Flittle** and **Espathra** upon their defeat or capture. Because it is a material and not a held item, it cannot be stolen during battle using moves like Thief or Covet; it is awarded during the post-battle summary.
