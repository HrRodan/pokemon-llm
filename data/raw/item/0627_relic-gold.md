## Identity & Utility
**Relic Gold** is a **Loot/Treasure** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An ancient gold coin minted by a civilization approximately 3,000 years ago. It serves no functional purpose in battle or exploration and is classified as "vendor trash"—an item intended solely to be sold for high profit. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot** be bought from standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 60,000 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Expensive**). While its internal cost is 60,000, it typically sells for 30,000 at standard shops, and significantly more when sold to specialized collectors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item acts as a high-value financial asset. Its primary utility is being sold to the **Maniac** (Item Maniac) or specific NPCs like the billionaire in Undella Town (Generation V) for a premium price (often up to 30,000 or more depending on the specific game's economy).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no tactical application in VGC or Smogon formats and should never be held in a competitive match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with specific Pokémon abilities beyond being a valid target for **Thief** or **Covet** if held by an opponent in the overworld.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in the **Abyssal Ruins** in the Unova region. It is part of the "Relic" series of artifacts (Relic Copper, Silver, Gold, Vase, Band, Statue, and Crown).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered as hidden loot or found in treasure chests within ancient ruins.
* **Lore Context:** The Relic Gold provides world-building flavor regarding the ancient history of the Pokémon world, specifically hinting at the "King" mentioned in the Abyssal Ruins' encrypted messages. In Unova, the billionaire in Undella Town is the primary buyer, seeking these items to complete his collection.
