## Identity & Utility
**Bright Powder** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that casts a "tricky glare," effectively lowering the accuracy of incoming moves. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that is used primarily in battle to provide a passive defensive layer through evasion.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). It is often available in post-game shops like the Battle Frontier or late-game Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held in battle, any move targeting the holder has its accuracy multiplied by **0.9x**. This translates to a flat **11.11% increase in evasion** for the holder.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no secondary effect when thrown using the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically a controversial "hax" item. While generally permitted in official VGC (Video Game Championships) formats, it is often banned or discouraged in community-run formats (like Smogon) under "Evasion Clauses." It is most effective on "stalling" Pokémon or those that already utilize evasion-boosting moves like Minimize or Double Team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. However, its effectiveness is notably countered by Pokémon with the **No Guard** ability or moves that bypass accuracy checks (e.g., Aerial Ace, Aura Sphere).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in Battle Facilities (Battle Subway, Battle Maison, Battle Tree) for BP (Battle Points) or sold in specialized shops in the late-game of various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature item for specific bug-type Pokémon. It can be found held by wild **Wurmple**, **Volbeat**, and **Illumise**. Given Wurmple’s commonality in early-game routes, it can be efficiently farmed using moves like **Thief**, **Covet**, or the **Frisk** ability.
