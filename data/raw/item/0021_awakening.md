## Identity & Utility
**Awakening** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation I** (noted in this record via Generation III data).
* **Description:** A spray-type medicine used to rouse a single Pokémon from the clutches of sleep. It is a **consumable** item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle to immediately negate the "Sleep" status condition.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a party Pokémon, it immediately **cures the Sleep status**, allowing the Pokémon to act on the same turn if used in battle (provided the trainer uses their turn to administer the item).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low physical damage; flinging this item does not transfer the status-curing effect to the target).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Staple.** In formal competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), items from the "Medicine" bag are prohibited. Competitively, players use **Chesto Berries** or **Lum Berries** as held items to achieve the same result automatically. In Nuzlockes, it is a vital, low-cost tool for surviving encounters with "Sleep-spamming" wild Pokémon or trainers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interaction with Pokémon evolution. It is a "countable" item, allowing trainers to stack large quantities in the bag for long treks through caves or forests.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Standard stock at **Poké Marts** across all major regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, etc.). It is typically unlocked very early in the game's progression, often available immediately after the first Gym Badge is acquired.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a frequent find for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability (such as Meowth, Zigzagoon, or Phanpy) at lower level tiers (typically levels 1–10).
* **Lore context:** As a "spray-type" medicine, it represents the standard of portable Pokémon healthcare, providing a specialized alternative to the more expensive and versatile Full Heal.
