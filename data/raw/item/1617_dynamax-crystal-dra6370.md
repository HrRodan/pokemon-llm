## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (dra6370)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized promotional item used in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair. While it has a technical cost associated with it, it is not a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Technical placeholder; typically acquired via serial codes rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), this crystal activates a pillar of light that remains active until the end of the day. This allows the player to challenge a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Duraludon**—in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used solely for encountering and catching rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon for the player's collection or team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly. However, it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that possesses the **Gigantamax Factor**, which cannot be obtained through standard evolution or breeding without the Max Soup (found in the Isle of Armor).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (dra6370) was primarily distributed via **promotional serial codes**, such as those found in *CoroCoro Comic* or through pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* Expansion Pass. It is not available through standard Poke Marts or gameplay loops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. As a digital-only distribution item, it is typically delivered via the **Mystery Gift** function.
* **Context:** These crystals were designed to provide players with early or guaranteed access to Gigantamax forms that were otherwise rare or locked behind limited-time Max Raid events. Once the raid is completed or the day ends, the item is consumed and the pillar of light disappears.
