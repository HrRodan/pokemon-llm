## Identity & Utility
**Griseous-orb** is a **Species-Specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically Pokémon Platinum).
* **Description:** A glowing, legendary orb specifically tuned to the frequency of the Distortion World. It is a **Held Item** that serves as a permanent transformation trigger for the Legendary Pokémon **Giratina**. It is a unique artifact that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Giratina**, it grants a **1.2x (20%) damage multiplier** to the holder's Dragon-type and Ghost-type moves. Furthermore, it causes Giratina to transform from its Altered Forme into its **Origin Forme**, shifting its base stats to be more offensive and changing its Ability to **Levitate**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Note: The item cannot be Flinged if held by Giratina, and no other Pokémon can effectively hold it in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Mandatory Core Item.** It is the exclusive requirement for using Giratina-Origin in competitive tiers (Ubers/VGC). While it provides a smaller power boost than a Life Orb, it is essential for Giratina's bulkier, ground-immune Origin Forme profile.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Forme Change:** Directly triggers the transformation of Giratina. If the item is removed (via Trick or Knock Off, though these moves often fail against it in specific generations), Giratina reverts to its Altered Forme.
    * **Restrictions:** In older generations (Gen IV), this item was restricted from being traded or used in certain wireless communication modes to prevent game-breaking synchronization issues between *Diamond/Pearl* and *Platinum*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in locations where the boundary between the Pokémon world and the Distortion World is thin. Notable locations include the **Distortion World** or **Turnback Cave** after defeating/catching Giratina.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a fixed world-event item acquired through exploration or legendary encounters.
* **Lore context:** The Griseous Orb represents the "gray" or "shady" essence of the Distortion World, acting as a physical anchor that allows Giratina to maintain its true form outside of its home dimension. It completes the trio of orbs alongside the Adamant Orb (Dialga) and Lustrous Orb (Palkia).
