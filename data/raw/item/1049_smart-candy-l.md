## Identity & Utility
**Smart Candy L** is a **Vitamin (Stat-Enhancer)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically appearing in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.

* **Description:** A large, energy-dense candy used to permanently increase the **Special Attack** stat of a Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought or sold, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than traditional shops. It represents the "Large" tier of the Smart Candy family, sitting between the standard Smart Candy and the Smart Candy XL.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon's **Special Attack Awakening Value (AV)** by 1 point. Unlike traditional Effort Values (EVs) found in other generations, AVs allow a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat, making this item vital for maximizing raw power in the Kanto-reimagined meta.
* **Usage Constraint:** This item is level-locked. It can only be administered to Pokémon that are **Level 30 or higher**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game environment where the move Fling and held items are not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** It is a mandatory requirement for "Max Stat" competitive formats within *Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee*. It is irrelevant to standard VGC or Smogon formats, as the AV system and the item itself do not exist in the core Series 8-9 or 1-7 mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Transfer Reward:** Primarily obtained by transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak. 
    * **Catch Combos:** High "Catch Combos" of Pokémon that yield Special Attack stats (like Gastly, Abra, or Magnemite) frequently reward the player with Smart Candies of various sizes.
    * **Poke Ball Plus:** Can be earned by taking a Pokémon for a "Stroll" in the physical Poké Ball Plus peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a reward for catching or transferring species.
* **Context:** In the *Let's Go* ecosystem, the "L" variant is designed for mid-to-late game progression, allowing trainers to optimize their special attackers once they reach the mid-30s level threshold.
