## Identity & Utility
**TM79** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. 
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike many items, the contents of TM79 have shifted significantly across different regions/generations, ranging from Dark-type offensive coverage to Ice-type tactical strikes and Normal-type revenge attacks. It is a **Consumable** (in early generations and Gen 8/9) or **Reusable** (Gen 5–7) item that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. Based on the provided data and historical context:
    * **Generation IV:** Teaches **Dark Pulse** (Special Dark-type move with a flinch chance).
    * **Generations V–VII:** Teaches **Frost Breath** (Special Ice-type move that always deals a critical hit).
    * **Generation VIII:** Teaches **Retaliate** (Physical Normal-type move that doubles in power if an ally fainted the previous turn).
    * **Generation IX:** Teaches **Dazzling Gleam** (Special Fairy-type spread move).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly variable. **Dark Pulse** and **Dazzling Gleam** are high-tier competitive staples for Special Attackers in both Smogon and VGC formats. **Frost Breath** is a niche pick often used to manually trigger a teammate's *Anger Point* ability. **Retaliate** is common in playthroughs or niche "revenge killer" sets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is limited to Pokémon with compatible movepools.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City, Goldenrod City) or via TM Crafting Stations in more recent generations. In its debut (Gen IV), it was famously found in **Victory Road**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through exploration, gym leader rewards, or specialized shops.
* **Technological Context:** As part of the "all-machines" category, it represents the standardized method of move distribution developed by Silph Co. and other regional tech conglomerates.
