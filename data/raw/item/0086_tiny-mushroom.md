## Identity & Utility
**Tiny Mushroom** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation II** (indexed in Generation IV in this dataset).
* **Description:** A small, red-capped mushroom characterized as a rare collector's item. It is a **Consumable/Loot** item that **cannot** be bought from standard Poké Marts; it is intended primarily for sale or specific NPC exchanges.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Moderate value**). While its purchase price is listed as 500, its primary utility is its sell price (250 Poké Dollars) or higher when sold to specialty "Maniac" NPCs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Primarily functions as "Vendor Trash" with no direct impact on a Pokémon's stats or health. However, in *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*, two Tiny Mushrooms can be traded to the Move Maniac in Island Two to allow a Pokémon to relearn a forgotten level-up move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats and should not be held in competitive play. It is strictly an economy-focused item for story progression and resource management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a value hierarchy: **Tiny Mushroom < Big Mushroom < Balm Mushroom.**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as hidden items in forest environments (e.g., Viridian Forest, Petalburg Woods) or obtained as a reward from the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently held by fungal-themed Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Paras**, **Parasect**, **Shroomish**, **Breloom**, **Foongus**, **Amoonguss**, **Morelull**, and **Shiinotic**. 
* **Special Markets:** In certain regions, specialized NPCs (like the Hungry Maid or Item Maniacs) will purchase these for 500 Poké Dollars, doubling the standard sell rate.
