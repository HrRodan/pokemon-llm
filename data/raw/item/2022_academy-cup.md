## Identity & Utility
**Academy Cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A cosmetic accessory used to customize the player's picnic layout. It belongs to the "Picnic Knacks" sub-category of items used to personalize the aesthetic of the player's outdoor camp. It is a **Consumable/Key-style Decorative** item that serves no functional purpose in battle or exploration.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale / Special Acquisition**). While similar picnic items are often sold at "Picnic Knacks" vendors in major Paldean cities (like Cascarrafa or Mesagoza), a cost of 0 typically indicates it is a milestone reward or a default item associated with the Naranja or Uva Academy.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When setting up a picnic, the player can select the Academy Cup to change the appearance of the cups on the picnic table. This is a purely visual modification and does not influence the "Egg Power," "Catching Power," or other buffs provided by sandwiches.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists outside the competitive battling circuit (VGC/Smogon) and is strictly for the "Picnic" minigame and social play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interaction with Pokémon evolution or abilities. It does not trigger any specific "Pickup" table rewards or ability-based effects.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained within the **Paldea region**. It is likely tied to the player's enrollment in the Naranja Academy (Scarlet) or Uva Academy (Violet). Players use these items to express their school pride during the "Academy Ace Tournament" storyline or while adventuring in the Great Crater of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a human-made accessory provided through the school system or specialty boutique shops.
