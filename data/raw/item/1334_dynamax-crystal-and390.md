## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AND390** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used within the Galar region. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Ruined Watchtower area of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Dynamax Pokémon to appear for a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; effectively **Not for sale** through standard in-game vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this item at the Watchtower Lair triggers a unique Max Raid Battle. Unlike standard Max Raid dens which require Wishing Pieces or natural resets, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific encounter designated by the crystal's ID (typically associated with event distributions).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is used specifically in the overworld).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is purely administrative/collection-based, allowing players to access specific Pokémon, often those with Hidden Abilities or those not normally found in their specific version of the game (Sword or Shield).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is a consumable; once the raid is triggered at the Watchtower Lair, the crystal is removed from the inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are **Event-Exclusive items**. They are typically distributed via Serial Codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, GAME, or Pokémon Center) or as pre-order bonuses for expansion passes and game bundles. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a special distribution item intended to drive player engagement with the Max Raid Battle mechanic.
* **Context:** The "AND390" designation refers to the internal indexing for a specific encounter. In the Galar region's lore, these crystals react specifically to the energy signatures of the Ruined Watchtower, focusing Power Spots to manifest specific Pokémon.
