## Identity & Utility
**Jade Orb** is a Plot-Advancement Key Item introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** A lustrous green gemstone steeped in ancient legend, possessing a deep metaphysical connection to the Hoenn region. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought, sold, or held** by a Pokémon. It functions as a specialized quest tool for high-level legendary encounters.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale / Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Jade Orb acts as a summoning catalyst. When the player carries this item to the **Embedded Tower** on Route 47, it resonates with the environment to trigger a static encounter with the Legendary Pokémon **Rayquaza**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld progression and catching legendaries; it provides no combat bonuses and cannot be brought into competitive ladder matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve any Pokémon, it is the third piece of the "Weather Trio" orbs. Unlike the Red and Blue Orbs in later generations (which triggered Primal Reversion), the Jade Orb remains strictly a summoning tool in its only appearance.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Johto remakes (*HG/SS*), the Jade Orb is a late-game reward obtained from **Professor Oak**. To acquire it, the player must typically present both Kyogre (from *HeartGold*) and Groudon (from *SoulSilver*) to the Professor, necessitating cross-version trading.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is a unique, script-generated item that cannot be duplicated or found via the **Pickup** ability. It represents the "mediator" role Rayquaza plays in Hoenn's mythology, balancing the sea and the land.
