## Identity & Utility
**Cyber-ball** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** Despite its name, this is not a device for catching Pokémon. It is a cosmetic and interactive toy used during the **Picnic** mechanic. It serves as a replacement for the default ball that Pokémon play with while the player is camping. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Decorative** item that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Standard price** for picnic customization items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When selected in the Picnic customization menu, it changes the appearance of the ball used for playing with Pokémon to a futuristic "Cyber" aesthetic. Pokémon can kick or push the ball around to increase their **friendship/happiness** levels.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in the Picnic sub-inventory and cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic/social feature with no impact on VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Picnic mechanic**, allowing for social bonding with the party.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities (such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a mass-produced consumer good for trainers.
* **Lore Context:** The Cyber-ball reflects the futuristic themes often associated with the Paldea region (particularly *Pokémon Violet*). It is designed for trainers who prefer a high-tech, digital aesthetic for their team-building exercises.
