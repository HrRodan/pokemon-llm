## Identity & Utility
**Blue-Dish** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A cosmetic customization item used to personalize the player's picnic table. It serves as a decorative element for the sandwich-making environment in the Paldea region. It is a **Non-Consumable/Key-Adjacent** item that is typically acquired through specialized vendors rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale** in standard shops; usually obtained through specific specialized boutiques).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a **Picnic**, the Blue Dish can be selected to change the aesthetic appearance of the tableware. This effect is purely visual and does not influence the "Meal Powers" or the success rate of sandwich recipes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This is a utility/cosmetic item for the overworld picnic mechanic and has no impact on competitive Pokémon battling (VGC or Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts solely with the **Picnic Customization** menu.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, items in the "Picnic" category (like dishes, tablecloths, and water bottles) are purchased at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major cities such as **Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a specialized tool for the Trainer's personal kit, often gathered to complete a full set of picnic aesthetics.
