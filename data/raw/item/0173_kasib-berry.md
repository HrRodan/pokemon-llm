## Identity & Utility
**Kasib Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable held item that provides a defensive buffer against Ghost-type aggression. As a "holdable-active" item, it is consumed automatically upon being struck by a super-effective move.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily sourced through cultivation or foraging rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it halves the damage taken from a single super-effective **Ghost-type** attack. The berry is consumed immediately after the effect triggers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally inefficient for Fling strategies).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Ghost-type** attack with 80 Base Power (Gen IV–V) or 60 Base Power (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **niche defensive staple**. It is frequently used on Psychic or Ghost-type Pokémon (who are often 4x weak to Ghost-type moves) to survive a predicted Shadow Ball or Astral Barrage. It is particularly valuable in **VGC (Doubles)** for Pokémon like Musharna or Indeedee to ensure they can set up *Trick Room* or support moves when facing faster Ghost-type threats like Dragapult or Calyrex-Shadow.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It interacts with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles damage reduction to 75%), **Harvest** (allows for berry restoration), and **Unburden** (doubles Speed once the berry is consumed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in berry patches across Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, and Alola. In most games, it is obtained via specialized Berry NPCs or by mutation/planting.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature held item for the **Duskull line** (**Duskull**, **Dusclops**, and **Dusknoir**). Players can farm this item using moves like *Thief* or *Covet*, or by utilizing a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability to identify holders in the wild.
