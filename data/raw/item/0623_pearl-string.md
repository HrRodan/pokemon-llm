## Identity & Utility
**Pearl String** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova Region)**.
* **Description:** A string of very large pearls that sparkle with a distinct silver color. It is a high-tier "vendor trash" item designed solely to be sold for a significant profit. It is a **Consumable (Economic)** item that **cannot be bought** from standard marts, only found or received.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value Loot**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves no functional purpose in battle or the overworld. Its sole utility is its high sell price. While it has a base cost of 20,000, it can be sold to specialized NPC collectors (such as the Ore Man in Unova's Icirrus City) for a premium—typically **25,000 Poké Dollars**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect). 
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no tactical advantage and should never be held in a competitive setting, as it serves only to increase the player's currency.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is the highest tier in the "Pearl" family of loot items, following the standard *Pearl* and *Big Pearl*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game areas, hidden underwater, or as rewards for high-level raids and side quests. In its debut region (Unova), it is famously found within the **Abyssal Ruins**. In later generations, it may appear as a rare reward from the Pickup ability (at level 91+) or from specialized vendors/events.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon according to standard encounter data; it is typically a static or hidden item found via the **Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine**.
