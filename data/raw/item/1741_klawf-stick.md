## Identity & Utility
**Klawf Stick** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A processed food ingredient specifically used in the Picnic mechanic of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It is a savory, crab-like meat harvested from the naturally shed claws of Klawf. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought at specific retail outlets.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component in Sandwich making to grant **Meal Powers**. It primarily contributes to the **Salty** and **Sour** flavor profiles. 
* **Meal Power Contributions:** When used in a sandwich, it typically boosts:
    * **Encounter Power:** Increases the likelihood of finding specific wild Pokémon.
    * **Humungo Power:** Increases the likelihood of finding large-sized Pokémon.
    * **Item Drop Power:** Increases the materials dropped by wild Pokémon after battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists exclusively for the out-of-battle Picnic mechanic and provides no statistical or tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. It is strictly a crafting/cooking component.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Readily available for purchase at **Deli Cioso** locations throughout the Paldea region, as well as the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. It is typically unlocked after the player has earned a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it is lore-linked to the Pokémon **Klawf**; the sticks are made from the meat within Klawf's claws, which drop off and regrow periodically, ensuring the process is sustainable and harmless to the Pokémon.
* **Context:** In the Paldean economy, it is a common delicacy used by trainers to optimize their shiny hunting and experience grinding through the Meal Power system.
