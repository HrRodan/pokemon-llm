## Identity & Utility
**Apple** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fresh, crisp fruit used primarily as a filling during the Picnic mechanic. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be purchased in bulk for culinary use. It is not a held item or a direct medicine.
* **Cost:** 130 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a Sandwich, the Apple contributes to the dish's **Meal Powers**. It provides a balance of Sweet and Sour flavors. While it has no direct healing or battle effect, it is a key component in recipes that grant:
    * **Encounter Power**
    * **Raid Power**
    * **Exp. Point Power** (Commonly associated with Ice-type or Flying-type recipes depending on the accompanying condiments).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle; it resides in the Ingredients bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Smogon or VGC formats as it cannot be used in battle. Its value is strictly for "shiny hunting" (Sparkling Power) or "EV training" (Exp./Encounter Power) via the Picnic system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component for the Paldean Sandwich system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at food-specific vendors across the Paldea region. It is most commonly purchased at **Sure Cans**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Delibird Presents** locations after the player has obtained a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike the "Sweet Apple" or "Tart Apple" found in Galar (which are Evolution Items), the standard Apple is a common grocery item intended for human and Pokémon consumption during picnics.
