## Identity & Utility
**Black-Glasses** is a **Competitive Held Item (Type-Enhancement)** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A pair of shady-looking spectacles designed to be held by a Pokémon. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that provides a passive offensive multiplier to specific move types. It is widely accessible and can be purchased or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the power of the holder’s **Dark-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage with no additional secondary effects upon flinging).
    * **Competitive Use:** While often outclassed by high-risk items like *Life Orb* (30% boost to all moves) or *Choice Band* (50% Attack boost but locks moves), Black-Glasses are a **Niche/Reliable** choice. They are preferred on Dark-type attackers (e.g., Bisharp, Weavile, or Krookodile) when the trainer wants to boost STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves like **Knock Off** or **Sucker Punch** without incurring recoil damage or being locked into a single move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It functions specifically as a combat multiplier and is unaffected by mechanics that target berries (like *Pluck* or *Bug Bite*), though it is neutralized by the ability **Klutz** or the move **Embargo**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in desert environments, urban back-alleys, or shops specializing in battle gear.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently associated with the **Sandile** evolutionary line. It can be farmed from wild **Sandile**, **Krokorok**, and **Krookodile** (typically a 5% encounter rate), making the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief/Covet** efficient ways to acquire multiple pairs.
