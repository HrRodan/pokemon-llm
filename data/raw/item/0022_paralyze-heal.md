## Identity & Utility
**Paralyze Heal** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** A specialized spray-type medicine designed to treat the paralysis status condition. It is a **consumable** item that can be used both during battle and in the overworld. While it can be held by a Pokémon, it has no passive effect when held; it must be manually administered by a Trainer.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly cures a single Pokémon of the **Paralysis** status condition. When used, it restores the Pokémon's Speed to normal and removes the 25% chance of being "fully paralyzed" (incapable of moving).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Does not apply any secondary status effects when flung; only deals minor damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Staple.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), this item is non-viable because Trainers cannot use items from the Bag. Players instead use the **Lum Berry** or **Cheri Berry** to achieve the same effect automatically while holding the item. In Nuzlockes, it is an essential early-to-mid-game resource to prevent losing a Pokémon to speed-drops or RNG-induced "parahax."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is part of the standard status-recovery suite alongside Burn Heal, Antidote, Ice Heal, and Awakening.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at **Poké Marts** in every region and usually accessible after obtaining the first Gym Badge. It is also frequently found as a hidden item or in Poké Balls scattered throughout the overworld in early-game routes.
* **Wild Held Item:** This specific item is rarely found on wild Pokémon (0 recorded instances in current data); however, the **Cheri Berry** is the natural equivalent often gathered from the environment or via the **Pickup** ability to serve the same function for free.
