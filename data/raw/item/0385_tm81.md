## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **X-Scissor** to a compatible Pokémon. X-Scissor is a Physical Bug-type move with 80 Base Power and no secondary effects, valued for its reliability. 
    * *Note:* In *Sword & Shield* (as per flavor text), it teaches **Bulldoze**, a Ground-type move that lowers the Speed of all hit Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot typically be used with the move Fling in a meaningful way).
    * **Competitive Use:** **X-Scissor** is a staple Bug-type coverage move for physical attackers such as **Scizor**, **Pinsir**, and **Gliscor**. It is preferred in formats where Bug-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) or coverage against Psychic, Dark, or Grass-types is required. **Bulldoze** is used as a utility move in VGC (Doubles) for speed control.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in Generation IV and Generation VIII+, but is reusable in Generations V through VII.
