## Identity & Utility
**Diglett Dirt** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of dirt left behind by a Diglett. This item serves as a crafting resource used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but is primarily used for move-pool expansion.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a specific ingredient required to craft various Technical Machines (TMs). It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to create Ground-type or earth-related moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a progression and customization item used strictly in the overworld to teach Pokémon new moves. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats outside of the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "Materials" pocket of the bag. While it is associated with the Diglett line, it does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional held-item capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop reward after defeating or catching wild members of the Diglett evolutionary line (**Diglett** or **Dugtrio**). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally held. In the Paldea region, it is automatically added to the player's inventory upon the successful conclusion of a battle with a wild **Diglett** or **Dugtrio**. It is a common drop for players farming Ground-type TMs such as *Mud-Slap*, *Bulldoze*, or *Stomping Tantrum*.
