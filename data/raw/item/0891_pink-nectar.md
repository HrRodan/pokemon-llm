## Identity & Utility
**Pink Nectar** is a species-specific utility item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A fragrant nectar gathered from flowering shrubs, specifically associated with Royal Avenue in the Alola region. It is a **Consumable Utility** item used outside of battle to trigger a physiological change in a specific Pokémon species. It is generally available for purchase in regions where the species is present.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to an **Oricorio**, the Pokémon consumes the nectar and changes its form to the **Pa’u Style**. This transformation alters Oricorio’s secondary typing to **Psychic**, making it a Psychic/Flying-type Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Pre-battle Preparation.** The item itself cannot be used during a competitive match. Its utility lies in team building, allowing a player to access the Pa’u Style Oricorio. This form is often considered the most defensive of the Oricorio styles, though it sees less usage in VGC compared to the Sensu (Ghost) or Pom-Pom (Electric) styles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with **Oricorio**. It is single-use and is consumed immediately upon changing the Pokémon's form. It does not facilitate evolution, only a "Forme" change.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally found at the flowering shrubs on **Royal Avenue** in the Sun/Moon series. In newer titles like *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, it is easily accessible through **Delibird Presents** shops once the player has obtained enough Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily an environmental or shop-purchasable resource. In its debut region (Alola), it was tied to the identity of **Akala Island**, where the pink flowers bloom.
