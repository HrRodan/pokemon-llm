## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Cyg7924)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-exclusive consumable used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a single-use mission item that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Placeholder cost; effectively **Not for sale** as it is a distribution-only item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, typically a **Gigantamax Corviknight**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (PvE Only).** While the item itself has no competitive application, the Pokémon caught from the resulting Raid often possess Hidden Abilities, high Individual Values (IVs), or the Gigantamax Factor, which are essential for competitive VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** den. Once the raid is defeated or the day ends, the item is consumed and removed from the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event Distribution item**. It was primarily made available through serial codes provided via pre-order bonuses (such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack) or specific retail/magazine promotions (e.g., CoroCoro or promotional flyers). It is not available via Poké Marts or standard NPC shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. The item is categorized as a "Crystal" but functions similarly to a "Key Item" with a consumable property.
