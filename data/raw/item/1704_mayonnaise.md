## Identity & Utility
**Mayonnaise** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A creamy condiment used specifically as a seasoning for the sandwich-making mechanic during Picnics. It is a consumable ingredient that can be bought in bulk to facilitate various Meal Powers.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the "Make a Sandwich" mini-game, Mayonnaise acts as a seasoning that contributes to the sandwich's final **Meal Powers**. It primarily provides points toward **Egg Power**, **Encounter Power**, and **Capture Power**, depending on the combination of other ingredients used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in a standard battle context; exclusively a Picnic/Inventory item).
    * **Competitive Use:** No direct utility in competitive battles (VGC/Smogon). Its value is strictly "meta-competitive," used to increase the efficiency of breeding (Egg Power) or finding specific Pokémon for training (Encounter Power).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It is one of the many ingredients required to complete the Sandwich Recipe Book.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at food-specific retail outlets across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Deli Cioso** branches and the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, Mayonnaise must be purchased from vendors or occasionally found as a sparkling item on the ground in specific "Picnic-heavy" areas.
