## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Catalog** is a **Gameplay / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized catalog featuring various household appliances designed to attract and house the Pokémon Rotom. It serves as a portable, reusable interface that allows Rotom to transition between its different elemental forms at the player's discretion. As a Key Item, it **cannot be sold or discarded**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, the catalog prompts the player to select one of several appliances for a Rotom in the party to inhabit. This changes Rotom’s form, typing, and signature move:
    * **Microwave Oven:** Rotom-Heat (Electric/Fire) - Learns **Overheat**.
    * **Washing Machine:** Rotom-Wash (Electric/Water) - Learns **Hydro Pump**.
    * **Refrigerator:** Rotom-Frost (Electric/Ice) - Learns **Blizzard**.
    * **Electric Fan:** Rotom-Fan (Electric/Flying) - Learns **Air Slash**.
    * **Lawn Mower:** Rotom-Mow (Electric/Grass) - Learns **Leaf Storm**.
    * **Light Bulb:** Returns Rotom to its base Form (Electric/Ghost).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** While the item itself isn't held in battle, it is the primary method for accessing top-tier competitive threats like **Rotom-Wash** (a premier pivot) and **Rotom-Heat** (an effective check to Steel/Fairy types). It allows players to pivot their team composition without needing to visit a specific "Rotom Room" as in previous generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a **Form Change** mechanic. It interacts exclusively with the Pokémon **Rotom**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sword/Shield:** Obtained from a man in a house in **Wyndon** after defeating him in a series of battles involving various Rotom forms.
    * **Scarlet/Violet:** Purchased via the **Porto Marinada auction** if the player has a Rotom in their party or boxes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The item is a unique tool typically gifted to trainers who demonstrate an interest in Rotom's versatile biology.
