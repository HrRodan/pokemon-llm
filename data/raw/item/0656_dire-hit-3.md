## Identity & Utility
**Dire Hit 3** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized, high-tier battle consumable that greatly increases a Pokémon's critical-hit ratio. Unlike standard items, it is exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic—a points-based item system used during specific multiplayer battle modes in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. It is a **Consumable** that **Cannot** be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via points during active combat).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon during battle, it raises the target’s **critical-hit rate by three stages**. In the context of Generation V mechanics, this significantly boosts the probability of landing a critical hit (shifting the ratio from the base 1/16 to roughly 1/3, or higher if using high-crit moves). The effect is lost if the Pokémon is switched out.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Restricted/Niche.** This item is not legal in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it relies entirely on the "Wonder Launcher" setting being enabled. Within that specific format, it is a powerful "set-up" item used to bypass an opponent's defensive boosts (since critical hits ignore the target's positive defense stages).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It functions similarly to a "Dire Hit," but provides a +3 stage boost instead of the standard +1 or +2 offered by lower-tier variants.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in the overworld or shops. It is generated dynamically within the **Wonder Launcher** interface during Link Battles, Infrared Battles, or Wireless Battles if the "Wonder Launcher" rule is toggled "On." Players must wait for their "Launcher Points" to accumulate over several turns before they can "purchase" and use the Dire Hit 3 mid-battle.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It exists only as digital data within the battle-subsystem of the Unova region's competitive tech.
