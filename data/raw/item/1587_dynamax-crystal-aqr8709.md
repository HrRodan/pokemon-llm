## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQR8709** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair within the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that facilitates access to rare Pokémon encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap; however, it is not traditionally sold in Marts and is primarily obtained through promotional serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), it causes a specific Pokémon—specifically **Gigantamax Sandaconda**—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. This allows the player and invited allies to battle and attempt to catch the Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly in battle. Its utility is purely administrative/event-based, serving as a gateway to acquire a Pokémon with the Gigantamax factor for competitive use in VGC or high-level Raids.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not trigger evolution or interact with standard abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via unique serial codes through specific retailers (such as GAME in the UK or GameStop in other regions) during promotional periods for Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield. It cannot be found through normal gameplay or purchased at standard Pokémon Centers.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a special event resource, meaning it cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief/Covet mechanics. 
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals like the AQR8709 were designed to bridge the gap between physical retail locations and digital gameplay, incentivizing players to visit stores to unlock rare "Gigantamax" encounters that might otherwise be difficult to find in the rotating Den spawns.
