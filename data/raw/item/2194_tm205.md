## Identity & Utility
**TM205 (Endeavor)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current iteration during **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Endeavor**. As a modern Technical Machine, it functions as a single-use crafting recipe in Gen IX, though the move itself is a series staple. It is a **Consumable/Craftable** item that cannot be bought with standard currency in most shops.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or by crafting at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Endeavor** to a compatible Pokémon. Endeavor is a Normal-type physical move that reduces the target's HP to exactly match the user's current HP. If the target has less HP than the user, the move fails.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Strategic/Niche.** Endeavor is the cornerstone of the "F.E.A.R." strategy (Focus Sash, Endeavor, Attack, Rat), allowing a low-level or low-HP Pokémon to instantly cripple a full-health wall or legendary. In VGC and Smogon, it is used by fast "Suicide Leads" or Focus Sash users to ensure they take an opponent down with them or leave them vulnerable to priority moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily taught to Pokémon with high speed or those capable of utilizing the **Sturdy** ability or **Focus Sash** item to survive at 1 HP.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy) within the *The Indigo Disk* expansion. Once found as a physical item in the overworld, it can be replicated at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, crafting this TM typically requires:
    * **5,000 LP**
    * **3x Taillow Plumes** (or similar avian/determined Pokémon materials)
    * **3x Mudbray Mud**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found in specific locations or crafted by the player using materials gathered from the **Pickup** ability or by defeating wild Pokémon.
