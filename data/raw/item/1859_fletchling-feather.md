## Identity & Utility
**Fletchling Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A dropped material shed by members of the Fletchling evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting component used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and has no overworld utility outside of the crafting menu.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily valued for its exchange rate into League Points (LP) or as a crafting ingredient).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) and other materials, it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held; not applicable for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly. Its value lies entirely in the **Metagame Preparation** phase, allowing players to teach essential moves to their competitive roster. Specifically, it is used to craft Flying-type and speed-control moves such as **TM113 (Tailwind)**, **TM027 (Aerial Ace)**, and **TM164 (Brave Bird)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource managed within the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Fletchling line. It is most efficiently gathered using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle mechanic in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Drops:** Dropped by wild **Fletchling**, **Fletchinder**, and **Talonflame**. As a common early-game encounter, this material is easily farmed in suburban and grassy biomes (e.g., South Province Area One).
