## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (SCO6247)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, event-exclusive consumable item used in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific Pokémon Den in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that is typically not available for purchase through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the data lists a cost, this item is essentially "Not for sale" in standard shops, as it is distributed via serial codes or special promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this item at the Watchtower Lair causes a specific Pokémon encounter (Max Raid Battle) to spawn. While the flavor text uses a variable, these crystals (like the similar *★And15* or *★And458*) were historically used to grant early-game access to version-exclusive Pokémon like **Larvitar** or **Jangmo-o**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a competitive battle scenario).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching rare Pokémon or farming Max Raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, and Dynamax Ore).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it facilitates the acquisition of rare Pokémon that may be required for Pokédex completion or competitive breeding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** as a pre-order bonus (such as the Pokémon Sword & Shield Dual Pack) or through retail promotions (e.g., GameStop/EB Games). It is not available at Poké Marts or found in the overworld through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item tied to the player's "Other Items" pocket.
* **Context:** In the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles that can force a Den to become active regardless of the current Max Raid cycle, making them highly prized by collectors and completionists.
