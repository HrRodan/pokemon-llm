## Identity & Utility
**Blunder Policy** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized battle item that rewards tactical risk. It triggers when the holder's move fails specifically due to accuracy or evasion checks. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that can be bought, though it is primarily found in post-game battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate; typically corresponds to a 20 BP purchase price in Battle Towers).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder uses a move that misses its target due to an accuracy or evasion check, the user’s **Speed stat is raised by two stages** (+100%).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High physical damage; no secondary effect when Flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **High-Risk/High-Reward Staple** in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon). It is most effective on Pokémon that utilize powerful but low-accuracy moves like *Hurricane*, *Sing*, *Hypnosis*, *Dynamic Punch*, or *Zap Cannon*. It effectively turns a "whiffed" turn into a massive momentum shift, allowing the user to outspeed and potentially sweep the opponent on the following turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon activation. It does not trigger if the move fails due to the opponent using *Protect*, *Detect*, or if the user is paralyzed/flinched. It specifically requires a failure in the accuracy calculation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at the **Battle Tower** (Galar/Sinnoh) or from specific vendors in the **Isle of Armor** via the Cram-o-matic. In newer regions, it is found in specialized shops like Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; this is a man-made "Policy" item (similar to the Weakness Policy) designed for professional Pokémon battling. It is rarely found in the overworld except as a hidden item in high-level areas.
