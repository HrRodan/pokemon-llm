## Identity & Utility
**Lansat Berry** is an **In-a-pinch Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A rare, serrated berry that acts as a consumable held item. It is designed for high-risk battle strategies, triggering a significant combat buff when the holder's health reaches a critical threshold. While it has a technical cost of 80 Poké Dollars, it is effectively **Not for sale** in standard Poké Marts and is considered a high-tier reward item.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **1/4 (25%) or less**, the Berry is consumed to increase the Pokémon's **critical-hit ratio by two stages** (Focus Energy effect).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. Using Fling will consume the berry and grant the target the increased critical-hit ratio (typically used in Double Battles to buff a teammate).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Flying-type** attack with **100 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a **Niche/Gimmick** item. It is most effective on Pokémon with the **Sniper** ability (like Kingdra or Drapion) or those using high-crit moves. It is frequently paired with **Substitute** or **Endure** to safely reach the 25% HP activation requirement. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is often used in conjunction with the **Starf Berry** as part of a set of rare "Battle Facility" rewards. It is ignored by Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability and can be harvested repeatedly in the overworld once a single specimen is obtained.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, the Lansat Berry is one of the most difficult items to obtain. In its debut (Gen III), it required a **100-win streak in the Battle Tower**. In modern generations, it remains a high-tier reward for long streaks in battle facilities (Battle Tree, Battle Subway, or Battle Tower) or via special events/Global Link distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, making its initial acquisition dependent entirely on high-level competitive play against NPCs.
