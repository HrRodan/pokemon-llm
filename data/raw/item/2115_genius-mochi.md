## Identity & Utility
**Genius Mochi** is a **Vitamin** (Consumable Medicine) introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically in the *The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** A sweet, specialized rice cake that can be fed to a Pokémon to enhance its growth. It is a consumable training item that is primarily obtained through gameplay rewards rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 125 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Specialized Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon's **Special Attack Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. Like modern vitamins, it can be used to raise the Special Attack stat to its maximum cap of 252 EVs, provided the Pokémon has not reached its total EV limit of 510.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** It serves as a direct alternative to Calcium. It is essential for competitive players and "shiny hunters" to quickly build Special Attack-oriented Pokémon (Special Sweepers) like Gholdengo or Flutter Mane without the need for repetitive wild battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use. It works effectively alongside the **Fresh-Start Mochi**, which resets EVs, allowing for precise stat re-customization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily earned as a reward for participating in the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame at Kitakami Hall. The amount and quality of Mochi received depend on the difficulty level cleared (Easy, Normal, or Hard).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is considered a specialty food item unique to the culture of the Kitakami region. It is most efficiently gathered through the minigame or occasionally found as sparkling floor items in the Kitakami wilds.
