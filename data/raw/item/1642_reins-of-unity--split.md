## Identity & Utility
**Reins of Unity (Split)** is a **Key Item** (categorized as "unused" in internal data but functioning as a form-change tool) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** These legendary reins were crafted to restore the bond between the King of Bountiful Harvests and his loyal steed. In this specific "Split" state, the item is used to separate **Calyrex** from its mount. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; Unique Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a **Calyrex (Ice Rider)** or **Calyrex (Shadow Rider)**, it separates the Pokémon into its constituent parts: Calyrex and either **Glastrier** or **Spectrier**. This requires an empty slot in the player's party to accommodate the separated steed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no in-battle effect, it is mechanically essential for competitive players (VGC/Smogon) to toggle between Calyrex's forms (Ice Rider vs. Shadow Rider) to suit different team archetypes or metagame shifts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item functions similarly to the **DNA Splicers** (Kyurem) or **N-Solarizer/N-Lunarizer** (Necrozma), serving as a mechanical toggle for "Fusion" legendary mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the main storyline of the **Crown Tundra** DLC. The player must facilitate the crafting of the reins using the **Radiant Flower** (grown by Calyrex) and a **Black Mane Hair** or **White Mane Hair** (plucked from the steed).
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item tied to the player's inventory and cannot be held by wild Pokémon or transferred via trading while attached to a Pokémon.
* **Lore context:** The Reins of Unity represent the union of mind and body. Without them, Calyrex lacks the power to fully manifest its potential or communicate its will effectively to its steed.
