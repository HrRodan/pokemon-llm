## Identity & Utility
**TM94 (Rock Smash)** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that grants the Fighting-type move **Rock Smash**. Historically classified as an HM (Hidden Machine) in earlier regions, this item transitioned to a TM format starting in Gen V, providing a mix of combat utility and environmental interaction. It is a **Consumable/Infinite-use** item (depending on the specific game version) that is **available for purchase**.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Mid-tier**). The price reflects its status as a permanent move-teaching tool in generations where TMs are not consumed upon use.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Rock Smash** to a compatible Pokémon. Rock Smash is a Physical Fighting-type move with a Base Power of 40. It has a high **50% probability** of lowering the target's Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Tier.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), Rock Smash is rarely utilized due to its low base power. However, it is a staple in **Nuzlocke challenges** and casual playthroughs for its high secondary effect rate, which can help soften defensive walls in the early-to-mid game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a "Field Move." In the overworld, it allows the player to shatter cracked boulders, which may clear paths or reveal hidden items, fossils, and wild Pokémon (such as Dwebble or Shuckle).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Department Stores (e.g., Shopping Mall Nine in Unova) or gifted by NPCs early in the journey to facilitate map exploration. Its presence in every generation from V through IX (including the Indigo Disk) highlights its necessity as a utility move.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be obtained through specialized vendors or specific plot-related NPCs. In games where it is not a TM, the move is often taught via a Move Tutor or HM.
