## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (lib5787)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special, single-use promotional item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Promotional**; though assigned a nominal value in the data, it is not sold in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—historically **Larvitar** (via the ★And15 code)—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The raid remains active until the end of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld. However, it is highly valued by competitive players for early-game access to the Tyranitar evolutionary line, which is a perennial staple in VGC and Smogon formats (Sand Stream support).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates the acquisition of version-exclusive or rare Pokémon. In the case of lib5787, it allows players to encounter Larvitar regardless of their game version (Sword/Shield).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** as a pre-order bonus for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack*. It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a special distribution item, often grouped with "Key Items" in terms of its unique delivery method, though it is consumed upon use.
* **Context:** These crystals were a primary marketing tool for Generation VIII, encouraging early adoption and retail partnerships. The "lib5787" identifier refers to the internal data index for the specific Larvitar encounter.
