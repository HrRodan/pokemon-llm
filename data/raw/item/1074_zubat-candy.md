## Identity & Utility
**Zubat Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically appearing in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with energy. Unlike standard vitamins or Rare Candies, this item is tailored specifically for the Zubat evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally acquired through gameplay loops rather than traditional mart purchases.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal value, its primary worth is in its specialized stat-boosting properties rather than its resale value.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a member of the Zubat family (**Zubat, Golbat, or Crobat**), it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 Awakening Value (AV)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling in the games where it exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is foundational for the "Awakening" system in the *Let's Go* series, where AVs replace the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. In the context of LGPE competitive play (Standard Rules), AVs are often disabled; however, in "No Restrictions" formats, using these candies to max out AVs (+200 to every stat) is mandatory for optimal performance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed to bypass the stat-cap limitations of general candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy), allowing a Zubat-line Pokémon to reach its maximum potential.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Zubat or transferring caught Zubat to **Professor Oak**. It is a reward for "grinding" a specific species, rewarding the trainer for ecological research and persistent catching.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded directly to the trainer upon a successful capture or through the **Pokémon Storage System** transfer mechanic. It serves as the primary mechanic for power progression in the Kanto-region reimagining.
