## Identity & Utility
**Electabuzz Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy-packed candy. Unlike generic candies (like Quick Candy), this item is specifically formulated for the Electabuzz evolutionary line. It is a **consumable enhancement item** used to permanently boost the stats of a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**). While it has a sell price, its primary value is found in its utility rather than its market cost.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Electabuzz family (**Elekid, Electabuzz, or Electivire**), it increases all six of the Pokémon’s stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **+1**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Within the *Let's Go* ecosystem, these candies are the primary method for maximizing **Awakening Values (AVs)**. They are essential for "Master Trainers" and competitive play within those specific titles, though they have no effect in traditional EV-based competitive formats (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the level-based restrictions often found with generic stat candies (like Large or XL candies), allowing for stat growth regardless of the Pokémon's current level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not purchased at standard Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired as a reward for catching wild Electabuzz, transferring Electabuzz to Professor Oak, or by walking with a Pokémon in the Poké Ball Plus peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a reward-tier item granted to the player for successful "catching streaks" or management of the Electabuzz species.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Alola-adjacent *Let's Go* mechanics, species candies represent a more efficient training method than generic stat candies, as they provide a comprehensive +1 to every stat category at once, significantly reducing the grind required to reach the 200 AV cap per stat.
