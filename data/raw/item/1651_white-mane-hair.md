## Identity & Utility
**White-Mane-Hair** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region, specifically the Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** This item consists of mane hair belonging to Glastrier, the "King of Bountiful Harvests’" loyal steed. Described as incredibly strong and flexible, it serves as a critical material for restoring the King's lost power. As a Key Item, it **cannot be sold, traded, or consumed**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The White-Mane-Hair is used exclusively to craft the **Reins of Unity**. When combined with the **Radiant Flower** (grown from Icy Carrots), it allows the player to create the artifact necessary to fuse Calyrex with Glastrier.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and enabling the "Ice Rider" form of Calyrex outside of active battle. Once the Reins of Unity are crafted, this specific material is removed from the inventory.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve a Pokémon in the traditional sense, it is a prerequisite for the **Forme Change** that creates **Calyrex (Ice Rider)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the main questline of the *Crown Tundra* DLC for *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It is given to the player by Calyrex after the player successfully defends the town's crops and chooses to grow Icy Carrots (leading to the encounter with Glastrier).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time story item. Its existence is a testament to the symbiotic relationship between Calyrex and its steed, representing the physical bond required to manifest their combined "Unity" form.
