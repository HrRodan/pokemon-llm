## Identity & Utility
**Rich-Mulch** is a specialized agricultural consumable introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**. 
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer designed to enrich the soil for Berry cultivation. It is a **Consumable** item used specifically in Berry patches. While it exists in the data for various games, its utility is region-locked to specific farming mechanics (notably the Berry Fields of Kalos).
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a soil patch before planting a seed, it **increases the total harvest yield by 2 Berries**. This makes it an efficiency tool for players looking to mass-produce rare Berries for competitive play or healing.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional status effect). 
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be used during a battle and provides no benefit if held. Its value is strictly for **resource management and farming** during the main game or post-game preparation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of four types of Mulch (alongside Boost, Amaze, and Surprise Mulch) used to manipulate Berry growth cycles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is primarily obtained by using the **Mulch Maker** (composting Berries) or purchased at the **Berry Fields**. In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is obtainable but serves no functional purpose as the Pelago system replaced traditional soil patches.
* **Region Limitation:** Interestingly, its flavor text notes it is "unsuitable for the soil in the Hoenn region." This serves as a mechanical explanation for why Mulch cannot be used in *Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, despite those games being part of the same generation as *X and Y*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be manufactured or purchased by the player. Often utilized by players focused on **Nuzlocke preparation** to ensure a steady supply of Sitrus or Lum Berries.
