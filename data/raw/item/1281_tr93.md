## Identity & Utility
**TR93 (Darkest Lariat)** is a **Technical Record (Move Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** This is a single-use instruction manual used to teach a Pokémon the move **Darkest Lariat**. Unlike traditional TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic "consumable" mechanic for high-value moves.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily acquired through the exchange of **Watts** (W) at Wild Area Watt Traders or as a reward for completing Max Raid Battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Darkest Lariat** to a compatible Pokémon.
    * **Move Profile:** A Physical Dark-type attack with 85 Base Power and 100% Accuracy.
    * **Unique Property:** It ignores the target's stat changes (Defense and Evasiveness buffs). This makes it an "unaware-style" physical attack, perfect for cutting through opponents who have boosted their bulk with moves like Iron Defense or Cosmic Power.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 85 (High damage output when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** Darkest Lariat is highly valued in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is famously the signature move of Incineroar but, via TR93, it is taught to physical bruisers like **Snorlax, Grimmsnarl, Rillaboom, and Guzzlord** to provide reliable Dark-type coverage that cannot be walled by defensive setup sweepers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Watt Traders:** Periodically sold by NPCs in the Galar Wild Area for Watts.
    * **Max Raid Battles:** Dropped as a reward for defeating Dark-type Raid Bosses (e.g., Grimmsnarl, Pangoro, Tyranitar).
    * **Cram-o-matic:** Can be synthesized in the Isle of Armor expansion using specific recipe combinations of Dark-type items.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be earned through raid participation or currency exchange, marking it as a "high-tier" reward for active exploration and combat.
