## Identity & Utility
**Aggronite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious evolutionary mineral designed specifically for the Aggron evolutionary line. When held by an Aggron, it enables **Mega Evolution** during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Non-Consumable Held Item** that cannot be purchased through standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Its value is priceless, typically found through exploration or awarded by specific NPCs, and it cannot be sold.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by an Aggron, the player can trigger a transformation into **Mega Aggron** at the start of a turn. This transformation increases Aggron's base stats (specifically boosting its Defense to a massive base 230) and changes its typing from Steel/Rock to **Pure Steel**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: Under standard battle mechanics, Mega Stones cannot be successfully used with the move Fling if the holder is the species that can Mega Evolve with it; they are also immune to being removed by moves like Knock Off or Thief in most generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Defensive Staple.** In the formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Gen VI and VII), Mega Aggron is a premier physical tank. The shift to pure Steel-type, combined with the **Filter** ability (which reduces damage from super-effective hits), makes Aggronite essential for turn-based longevity and stall-oriented teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution. It facilitates a temporary, mid-battle state change. It has no effect when held by any Pokémon other than Aggron.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Pokémon Y), it was a version-exclusive item found in Cyllage Gym. In later titles like Sun/Moon, it was typically obtained as a prize from the **Battle Tree** or via special distributions. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure, often hidden in locations with high geological energy or gifted to those who have mastered the bond between Trainer and Pokémon. Unlike items like the Hard Stone, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
