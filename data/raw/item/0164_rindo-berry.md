## Identity & Utility
**Rindo-berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Berry used to mitigate elemental weaknesses. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be held by a Pokémon to trigger a defensive effect in battle. While it has a technical cost, it is typically acquired through cultivation or foraging rather than direct purchase.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a **super-effective Grass-type attack**, the Berry is consumed to **halve (50% reduction)** the damage taken from that hit. It only activates if the move is super-effective against the holder's current typing.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary status effect).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Grass-type** attack with a base power of 80 (Gen IV–V) or 60 (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche Competitive Staple**, specifically favored by Pokémon with a **4x weakness to Grass**, such as Water/Ground types (**Swampert, Gastrodon, Quagsire**) or Water/Rock types (**Carracosta**). It allows these Pokémon to survive a predicted 4x Grass move and retaliate or set up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It can be used as a cooking ingredient for Poffins or Pokéblocks. It interacts with abilities like **Unnerve** (prevents consumption) and **Harvest** (allows the Berry to be restored after use).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in Berry patches across various regions or obtained from NPCs who give out daily Berries. In many games, once one is found, it can be mass-produced via planting and watering.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a rare held item for several Water-type Pokémon, specifically **Finneon**, **Lumineon**, **Panpour**, and **Simipour**. These can be farmed using the **Thief** or **Covet** moves or gathered via the **Pickup** ability in certain level brackets.
