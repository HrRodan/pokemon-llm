## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PSC8773** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, single-use consumable used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/placeholder cost; strictly an **Event Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch section of the Wild Area) initiates a Max Raid Battle. This specific crystal (PSC8773) was historically used for promotional distributions to allow players to encounter specific Pokémon, such as Gigantamax Copperajah or other event-specific targets.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, it is highly valuable for competitive preparation as it guarantees an encounter with a Pokémon that typically possesses high Individual Values (IVs), a Hidden Ability, or the Gigantamax Factor, which can then be used in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Once the raid is triggered, the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts or through natural exploration. It was distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** provided by retailers (such as Pokémon Center stores or partner retailers) during specific promotional periods.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. Unlike items found via the **Pickup** ability, these crystals are strictly administrative/event-based rewards designed to drive community engagement and store foot traffic.
