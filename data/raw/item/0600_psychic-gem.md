## Identity & Utility
**Psychic Gem** is a **Jewel (Type-Specific Gem)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A single-use, consumable held item imbued with "essence of the mind." It is designed to provide a one-time tactical power boost to Psychic-type offensive maneuvers. In its debut generation, it functions as a "burst damage" tool that is consumed immediately upon the execution of a damaging Psychic move.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically found through exploration rather than standardized Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the first successful damaging **Psychic-type move** used by **1.5×**. The item is consumed immediately after the move hits.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems generally cannot be used effectively with Fling or have 0 power; the item is intended for consumption via move execution).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Gen V Staple:** In its introductory generation, Gems were elite competitive items used to secure specific OHKOs (One-Hit KOs) that would otherwise be impossible. 
        * **Ability Synergy:** Highly effective when paired with the **Unburden** ability. Once the Psychic Gem is consumed, the Pokémon's Speed is doubled.
        * **Legacy Note:** In subsequent generations (Gen VI onward), the power boost of Gems was nerfed from 1.5× to 1.3×, and most Type Gems (including the Psychic Gem) became unobtainable in standard play, making them a "Legacy" item primarily associated with the Unova era.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-enhancement consumable.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically acquired in the Unova region through **Dust Clouds** in caves (Wellspring Cave, Chargestone Cave, etc.). It is rarely sold in shops and is instead treated as a reward for exploration and "treasure hunting" mechanics.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Most trainers must rely on the **Pickup** ability or environmental phenomena (like the aforementioned Dust Clouds) to farm multiple units.
* **Lore:** The item represents a physical crystallization of psychic energy, allowing a Pokémon to tap into a reservoir of mental strength for a single, overwhelming strike.
