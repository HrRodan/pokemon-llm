## Identity & Utility
**Blank Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A stone tablet engraved with a mysterious pattern. It is a fragment of the power of the "Original One." While most plates grant elemental typing, the Blank Plate embodies the **Normal** type. It is a **Key Item** (within its debut game) that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on the Mythical Pokémon **Arceus**, it changes Arceus’s type to **Normal**. It also ensures that Arceus's signature move, **Judgment**, deals Normal-type damage. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in the games where it appears).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-standard.** In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, this item exists to allow Arceus to return to its base Normal-type form within the game's unique "Key Item Plate" UI. In traditional competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), Arceus is Normal-type by default and does not require an item to maintain this state; therefore, the Blank Plate has no utility in standard held-item formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically tied to the **Multitype** ability and the move **Judgment**. It is required for completionists in *Legends: Arceus* to have the full suite of elemental transformations available for the Alpha Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in standard Poké Marts. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is obtained as a reward for completing **Request 66: "The Sea's Legend,"** which involves the mystery of Manaphy and Phione in the Cobalt Coastlands.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact associated with Sinnoh/Hisui creation myths.
* **Lore:** According to Hisuian legend, the plates are fragments of the universe's creation. The Blank Plate represents the "emptiness" or "totality" of the Normal type from which all other types diverge.
