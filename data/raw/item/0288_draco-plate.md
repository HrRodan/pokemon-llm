## Identity & Utility
**Draco Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet inscribed with Dragon-type energy. It serves as a specialized held item that enhances offensive capabilities and alters the physiology of specific legendary Pokémon. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Holdable-Active**, meaning its effects are persistent throughout a battle.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Specialty**). While it has a defined value, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically treated as a rare find or treasure.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held, it increases the power of the holder’s **Dragon-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but results in the loss of the item for the remainder of the battle.
    * **Competitive Use:** In standard play, it is often outclassed by *Dragon Fang* (which provides the same boost) or *Life Orb* (which boosts all moves). However, it is **mechanically mandatory** for **Arceus-Dragon** builds. It is considered a niche item in Smogon/VGC formats unless used specifically to bypass "item clause" or to change Arceus’s form.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Multitype:** If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (Arceus), the holder’s primary type changes to Dragon.
    * **Judgment:** It changes the type of the move **Judgment** to Dragon.
    * **Legendary Lore:** In certain games (like *Legends: Arceus*), it is a Key Item used to bestow the Dragon-type blessing.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through exploration rather than commerce. In its debut region (Sinnoh), it is commonly found via the **Underground** mining mechanic or as a hidden item behind the statue in Eterna City. In subsequent generations, it is often found in marine environments (Abyssal Ruins) or gifted by NPCs after meeting specific criteria.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It is unique and usually limited in quantity per save file, reflecting its status as a fragment of the universe's creation lore.
* **Attributes:** The item possesses the `underground` attribute, highlighting its historical association with archaeology and fossil hunting in the Sinnoh region.
