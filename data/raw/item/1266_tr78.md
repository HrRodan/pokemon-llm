## Identity & Utility
**TR78 (Sludge Wave)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Sludge Wave**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, representing a return to the classic consumable machine mechanic for high-tier moves.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). In the Galar region, these are primarily traded for **Watts** (approx. 5,000–8,000 W) via Watt Traders, reflecting its status as a high-power offensive tool.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sludge Wave** (Poison-type, Special, 95 Base Power, 100% Accuracy). The move strikes all adjacent Pokémon in double battles and has a 10% chance to inflict the Poison status condition.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 95. Using the move Fling with TR78 deals significant damage, matching the base power of the move it contains, though it consumes the item.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Sludge Wave is often preferred over Sludge Bomb in competitive singles (Smogon) because it has slightly higher base power (95 vs 90) and, crucially, it is **not** blocked by the ability *Bulletproof* (which affects "ball and bomb" moves). It is a premier STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) choice for Special Attackers like Nidoking, Gengar, and Nihilego. In VGC (Doubles), its use is more tactical as it hits the user's ally unless they are Steel-type or have the Telepathy ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Poison-type Pokémon and several "pollutant-themed" Pokémon like Muk, Weezing, and Garbodor.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found in the **Galar Region Wild Area**. It is rotated daily through **Watt Traders** and is a common drop from high-level (4-5 star) **Max Raid Battles** involving Poison-type Pokémon (e.g., Toxtricity, Vileplume, or Salazzle).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is exclusively obtained through Galar’s raid economy or specialized vendors. Its presence in the game world is linked to the concentrated energy of Power Spots and Dynamax energy.
