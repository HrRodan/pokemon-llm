## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (lyr7298)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It serves as a beacon to force a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, this crystal is tied to a specific Pokémon species (determined by the internal ID `lyr7298`). It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that is generally not purchasable through standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but functionally a placeholder value as these are typically distributed via Serial Codes or special events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone structure in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. This encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the "Max Raid" PvE (Player vs. Environment) mechanic to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon, often those with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** These crystals were primarily used for event distributions (such as those involving Gigantamax Pokémon like Centiskorch, Sandaconda, or Copperajah) to allow players to face them regardless of standard weather or den RNG.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase in-game. These items were historically distributed through real-world retail partnerships (such as GameStop or Pokémon Center promotions) via Serial Codes.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a digital-only event distribution item.
* **Usage Context:** In the context of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, Dynamax Crystals provided a guaranteed way to host a specific raid for friends or community members, as the Watchtower Lair is dedicated exclusively to these event-driven encounters.
