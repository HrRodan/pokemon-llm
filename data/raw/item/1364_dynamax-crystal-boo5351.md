## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (BOO5351)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a special, single-use consumable event item designed for use in the Galar Wild Area. It is used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** to trigger a Max Raid Battle. It functions as a beacon to summon a specific Pokémon that would otherwise be rare or exclusive to certain events.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). While it has a nominal internal value, it cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts; it is an event-exclusive distribution item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (associated with the internal ID BOO5351) to appear in a Max Raid Battle. This encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and provides no tactical advantage during combat. Its utility is purely for **Acquisition**, allowing players to catch Pokémon that often possess Hidden Abilities, high Individual Values (IVs), or the Gigantamax factor, which are essential for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon successful activation at the designated Raid Den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed as **Event/Promotional items** via serial codes. These were often tied to pre-order bonuses (e.g., the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack), retail distributions (like GameStop or Target), or special movie tie-ins. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a "Key-like" consumable granted through external distributions rather than standard gameplay or the **Pickup** ability.
* **Location Specificity:** The item is geographically locked to the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Galar Wild Area). Using it elsewhere has no effect.
