## Identity & Utility
**Sandwich** is an **Event Item / Core Mechanic** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** While categorized here as an event item, the Sandwich represents the central "Picnic" mechanic of the Paldea region. It is a **Consumable Crafting Mechanic** used to provide temporary, wide-ranging buffs to the player. It cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no direct combat application.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; as a mechanic, it is "Special Acquisition" through crafting or specific vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Consuming a sandwich triggers **Meal Powers** that last for 30 minutes. These powers drastically alter the game world and include:
    * **Sparkling Power:** Increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon.
    * **Encounter Power:** Increases the spawn rate of specific Pokémon types.
    * **Egg Power:** Speeds up the discovery of Pokémon Eggs at Picnics.
    * **Humungo/Teensy Power:** Influences the physical size of wild Pokémon.
    * **Exp. Point/Raid Power:** Boosts experience gain or rewards from Tera Raid Battles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Preparatory.** While it provides no benefit *during* a ranked match, it is the primary tool for competitive players to "hunt" for 0-IV/High-IV Tera Raid specimens and to breed competitive teams quickly via Egg Power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but certain sandwiches are required to trigger the "Picnic" friendship-building mechanics, which can indirectly assist in friendship-based evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Sandwiches are primarily "built" by the player during Picnics using ingredients purchased from shops like **Deli Cioso**, **Sure Cans**, and **Aquarius**. Pre-made sandwiches can also be purchased at **Every Wich Way** restaurant locations across Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. However, the rare **Herba Mystica** ingredients required for high-tier "Sparkling Power" sandwiches are exclusively obtained as rare drops from **5-star and 6-star Tera Raid Battles**.
