## Identity & Utility
**Dire Hit** is a **Stat-Boost Battle Item** introduced in **Generation I** (metadata indicates Generation IV Sinnoh-era data).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable designed for use during combat. It focuses on offensive precision by sharpening a Pokémon's focus to land more frequent critical hits. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that can be bought at most major Department Stores. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during a battle, it raises the critical-hit ratio of the active Pokémon. In modern iterations, this typically increases the crit-stage by **2 levels**. This effect is temporary and resets if the Pokémon is switched out or the battle ends. It also provides a minor boost to a Pokémon's happiness (1/1/0 scale) upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Competitive.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), players cannot use items from the bag. Its utility is strictly limited to **in-game playthroughs, Nuzlockes, and Speedruns** where forcing critical hits can bypass an opponent's defensive stat boosts (like Iron Defense).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is often categorized alongside "X-Items" (like X Attack or X Speed) as part of a trainer's tactical kit for boss battles or Gym Leaders.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, Lilycove City) and occasionally found as floor items in caves or mountainous routes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or found as overworld loot.
* **Strategic Context:** Historically, Dire Hit was less reliable in early generations, but since the critical hit rework in Generation VI, using a Dire Hit often brings a Pokémon very close to a guaranteed critical hit (100% rate) if paired with high-crit moves (like Stone Edge or Slash) or the Super Luck ability.
