## Identity & Utility
**Legendary Clue (?)** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra DLC).
* **Description:** A mysterious note featuring a photograph of a glowing rift appearing above the Max Lair. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It serves as a narrative trigger for post-game content.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon acquisition, this item initiates the final "Legendary Clue" questline in the Crown Tundra. It alerts the player to the presence of **Ultra Beasts** and **Necrozma** within the Max Lair's Dynamax Adventures.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no battle utility and exists solely to advance the storyline and unlock specific legendary encounters in the overworld/Max Lair.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon, but it is required to trigger the appearance of Ultra Beasts in the Galar region, effectively "unlocking" that portion of the National Pokédex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a dropped item on the floor of the Max Lair base camp in the Crown Tundra after the player has completed the first three legendary clues (concerning Calyrex, the Legendary Giants, and the Galarian Legendary Birds). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique story item dropped by the NPC **Peony**.
* **Context:** The item represents the "Legendary Clue ?"—a mystery that even Peony, the expedition leader, was initially unaware of. It bridges the Galar region's lore with the Ultra Beast phenomenon from the Alola region.
