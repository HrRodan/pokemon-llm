## Identity & Utility
**TM18 (Rain Dance)** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation II** (as Rain Dance) and appearing across almost every subsequent region, including Hoenn (Gen III) and Alola.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the ability to manipulate the weather. It teaches the move **Rain Dance**. As a Machine, its usage (single-use vs. infinite-use) depends on the specific game engine, but it is generally a high-value utility item.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). This price point reflects its status as a foundational element for weather-based strategies.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Rain Dance** to a compatible Pokémon. When used in battle, the move summons heavy rain for five turns (eight if the user holds a Damp Rock).
    * *Historical Note:* In Generation I, TM18 taught the move **Counter**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Weather Effects:** Under Rain Dance, Water-type moves deal **1.5x damage**, while Fire-type moves are reduced to **0.5x damage**. It also grants 100% accuracy to the moves *Thunder* and *Hurricane*.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** TM18 is the cornerstone for "Rain Teams." It is used to enable abilities like **Swift Swim** (doubles Speed in rain), **Hydration** (cures status), and **Dry Skin**. While automatic weather setters (like Pelipper with Drizzle) are often preferred, TM18 remains a vital backup or niche pick in VGC and Smogon tiers to override opposing weather (Sun/Sand/Snow).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for teams utilizing Pokémon that require rain to be effective, such as Kingdra, Ludicolo, or Archaludon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in major Department Stores (e.g., Celadon City, Lilycove City, or Veilstone City) or found in coastal/rainy routes. In more recent generations (Gen IX), it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a man-made device. It is generally acquired through purchase, exploration, or as a reward from Gym Leaders specializing in Water-type Pokémon.
* **Context:** Rain Dance is considered one of the "Core Four" weather moves alongside Sunny Day (TM11), Sandstorm (TM37), and Hail/Snowscape. It is often the first weather-setting TM available to players in many regions.
