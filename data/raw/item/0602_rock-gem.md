## Identity & Utility
**Rock Gem** is a **Jewel (Type-Enhancing Gem)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A small, crystalline gem imbued with lithic essence. It is a **Consumable Competitive Held Item** designed to provide a one-time offensive burst. When held by a Pokémon, it automatically triggers upon the use of a damaging Rock-type move, strengthening the attack before being consumed.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its availability is often limited to special find mechanics rather than standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Rock-type move, the **Rock Gem increases the power of that move by 1.5×** (in Generation V) and is consumed immediately. 
    * *Note:* In later generations (Gen VI onwards), the multiplier for Gems was globally reduced to 1.3×, though the Rock Gem itself became largely unavailable in standard gameplay.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item is typically consumed by its own effect before Fling can be utilized; the data lists no Fling power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Historical Staple.** In the Gen V competitive scene, Rock Gems were used to secure specific "One-Hit Knockouts" (OHKOs) on threats like Volcarona or Dragonite. It is highly effective when paired with the ability **Unburden**, as the consumption of the Gem doubles the user's Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any known Pokémon. It specifically interacts with damaging moves like *Stone Edge*, *Rock Slide*, or *Head Smash*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in **Dust Clouds** within caves across the Unova region. In later titles, Gems are often restricted to special Battle Frontier/Battle Tree rewards or are entirely unavailable in standard regional Pokédexes.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be gathered through environmental exploration (specifically the **Dust Cloud** mechanic) or earned through battle facilities.
* **Lore:** Representing the raw power of the earth, these gems are thought to be concentrated shards of elemental energy that shatter upon releasing their stored potential.
