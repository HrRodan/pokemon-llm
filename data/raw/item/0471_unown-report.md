## Identity & Utility
**Unown Report** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically prominent in *HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** A specialized logbook designed to catalog the various shapes and forms of the Symbol Pokémon, Unown. It functions as a specialized "sub-Pokédex" for researchers. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides the trainer with a visual checklist of all discovered Unown forms (A–Z, !, and ?). As the player captures new variations, the report updates to display the corresponding letter/symbol and the associated "word" or meaning attributed to that form.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no combat application and exists purely for collection tracking and post-game completion within the Johto region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Completing pages in the Unown Report is often a prerequisite for triggering specific in-game events, such as opening hidden chambers in the Ruins of Alph or making the "!" and "?" forms appear.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained from a researcher at the **Ruins of Alph** Research Center. In *HeartGold and SoulSilver*, it is typically given to the player after they have captured at least three unique forms of Unown.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique piece of equipment provided by NPCs to assist in archeological research.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents the ongoing scientific effort to decode the mystery of the Unown, which are said to resemble ancient script and possess a strange, collective power when gathered in groups.
