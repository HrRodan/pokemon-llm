## Identity & Utility
**TR10 (Earthquake)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item used to teach the move **Earthquake**. In Generation VIII, TRs represent powerful or high-utility moves that are consumed upon use, unlike the infinite-use TMs of the same era. It is a **Consumable Machine** that can be acquired through specific regional currencies and activities.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). While assigned a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for 8,000 Watts in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the Pokémon the move **Earthquake**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Ground-type, Physical, 100 Power, 100% Accuracy. It hits all adjacent Pokémon in double battles and deals double damage to targets currently using the move Dig.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100. This is a very high Fling value, making it a viable (though expensive) emergency high-damage projectile.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Absolute Staple.** Earthquake is widely considered one of the best moves in the history of competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). Its perfect accuracy, high base power, and excellent offensive typing make it a mandatory inclusion for almost any physical attacker capable of learning it.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a core component of "EdgeQuake" coverage (Stone Edge + Earthquake), a legendary offensive combination in competitive play.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword and Shield**. It is most commonly found as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** against Ground-type Pokémon or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area on a rotating inventory basis.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered via Galar's Raid ecosystem rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
