## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal EQU8131** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It is a single-use consumable that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. While it has a technical cost associated with it, it is not a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but practically a unique promotional item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Duraludon**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until defeated and caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a raid encounter. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess the **Gigantamax Factor**, high Individual Values (IVs), or Hidden Abilities, which are highly valuable for competitive teambuilding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was primarily distributed via **serial codes** through retail promotions (such as GameStop or the Pokémon Center) as a pre-order bonus or special event for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts or in-game vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is an "Event Item" that appears in the "Other Items" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar particles. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which summon random encounters from active dens, a labeled crystal like EQU8131 "tunes" the Watchtower Lair to a specific, powerful frequency to attract a predetermined Gigantamax-capable species.
