## Identity & Utility
**Veluza Fillet** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A thin, firm slice of Veluza meat. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a TM Machine. While it has a cost value, it is primarily an exchange resource rather than a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a specialized currency at the **Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine)**. It is required to craft specific TMs that match Veluza’s movepool and biological themes. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly for overworld progression and move-set customization via the crafting system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is used as a reagent for crafting several TMs, most notably:
    * **TM063 (Psychic Fangs)**
    * **TM124 (Ice Spinner)**
    * **TM197 (Dual Wingbeat)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed or high-probability drop after defeating or catching a wild **Veluza**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is part of the Gen IX **Material Drop** mechanic. It is frequently found in the waters of the **Paldean Sea** and **Casseroya Lake**, where Veluza are known to aggressively pursue trainers using their "Fillet Away" ability.
* **Context:** In the Paldea region, these fillets are common byproducts of the ecosystem, reflecting Veluza's unique ability to shed its own flesh to boost its speed and agility.
