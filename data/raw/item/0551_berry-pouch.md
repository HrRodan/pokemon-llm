## Identity & Utility
**Berry Pouch** is a **Key Item** (Categorized as Gameplay) introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A specialized container designed specifically for carrying and organizing Berries. In the context of the Kanto region (FireRed/LeafGreen), it is treated as a sub-inventory that attaches to the "Key Items" compartment of the player's Bag. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Unique Key Item; Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a dedicated storage interface for all Berries collected by the player. Selecting the Berry Pouch from the Key Items pocket opens a separate sub-menu where Berries can be used, given to Pokémon to hold, or tossed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle inventory management tool used exclusively during the main story of Generation III Kanto games.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the inventory system to prevent the main Bag pockets from becoming cluttered with numerous berry varieties.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*, the player receives the Berry Pouch from a specific NPC (such as the guy in the Pewter City Pokémon Center or during the early-game tutorial phases) to facilitate the gathering of Berries from Berries trees or wild Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool provided to the Trainer. It reflects the era-specific inventory constraints of the Game Boy Advance titles, where the "Bag" had limited slots compared to modern iterations.
