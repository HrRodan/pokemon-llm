## Identity & Utility
**Power Plant Pass** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** This item serves as a specialized ID card required to gain entry to the power plant facility located in the Lumiose Badlands (Route 13). It is a **Key Item** that cannot be sold, traded, or discarded, as it is essential for storyline progression.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to the interior of the **Kalos Power Plant**. Specifically, it unlocks the locked side entrance to the facility, allowing the player to confront Team Flare and restore power to Lumiose City.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely as a narrative gate and provides no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is a one-time plot-progression tool that remains in the player's Key Items pocket even after its primary objective is completed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained in the **Lumiose Badlands (Route 13)**. It is not purchased from a Mart; instead, the player must locate it hidden in the environment. Specifically, it is dropped by a Team Flare Grunt or found near the plant's entrance after an encounter with Team Flare.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. Unlike consumable items, it is unique to the player's inventory and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief.
* **Narrative Context:** The Power Plant Pass represents the heavy security surrounding the Kalos region's energy infrastructure. Its recovery is a turning point in the *Pokémon X & Y* storyline, as it allows the protagonist to stop Team Flare's energy siphoning, which is vital for re-opening the gates to North Lumiose City.
