## Identity & Utility
The **TMV Pass** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized commuter pass required to use the High-Speed Rail (TMV) system. It functions as a permanent travel permit that allows the player to move between Lumiose City and Kiloude City. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be discarded or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story-related item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player unrestricted access to the TMV train at Lumiose Station. This is the primary method of reaching Kiloude City, a location otherwise inaccessible through normal traversal (Fly, Surf, or walking).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and narrative advancement.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities. It serves strictly as a "gatekeeper" item for post-game content.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained in **Pokémon X and Y**. It is gifted to the player by **Professor Sycamore** at the Lumiose Station.
* **Acquisition Context:** The pass is awarded only after the player has entered the **Hall of Fame** (defeated the Elite Four and the Champion). This makes it a critical milestone marker, signaling the transition into the "Post-Game" phase of the Kalos region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind asset provided via a scripted event.
