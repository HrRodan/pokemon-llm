## Identity & Utility
**Chilan Berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A consumable held item that provides a one-time defensive buffer against Normal-type moves. It is classified as a `holdable-active` item, meaning it triggers automatically in response to a specific battle condition.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low purchase/sell value, it is primarily obtained through foraging or cultivation rather than standard Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it is consumed to **halve the damage (50% reduction)** taken from a single super-effective or neutral **Normal-type attack**. Unlike most other type-reduction berries, it triggers on any Normal-type hit because Normal is never "super-effective" against any type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown via Fling).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Normal-type** attack with **60 Base Power** (Gen VI+) or **80 Base Power** (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), it is rarely used compared to berries that resist common coverage types (like Shuca or Yache). Its primary utility is to survival high-damage Normal moves like **Explosion**, **Self-Destruct**, or **Boomburst** from specialized attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. It is compatible with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles the damage reduction) and **Unnerve** (prevents the opponent from eating it).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in berry patches across various regions or received from NPCs (such as the Berry Master).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature held item for the **Rattata** and **Raticate** evolutionary lines. Trainers can farm this berry by using moves like **Thief**, **Covet**, or by catching these wild Pokémon, often facilitated by the **Pickup** ability or **Compound Eyes** to increase encounter rates of held items.
