## Identity & Utility
**Pickle** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A sliced condiment used during the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a **Consumable Material** that is primarily used to influence Meal Powers. It cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and is categorized as a culinary resource rather than a traditional medicine or held item.
* **Cost:** 90 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Highly Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a sandwich filling, Pickles contribute specific values to the sandwich's Meal Power calculations. They are predominantly associated with **Sour** flavors and provide a significant boost toward **Fighting-type** Meal Powers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While it has no utility in a standard 6v6 or VGC battle, it is essential for competitive players to trigger **Egg Power** (for faster breeding) or **Humungo/Teensy Power** (for size-dependent competitive niches).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic/Sandwich** subsystem of the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at retail outlets specializing in foodstuffs. It can be purchased in bulk from **Deli Cioso** locations, **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia, and **Sure Cans** vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, this is a commercially processed item that cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild species.
