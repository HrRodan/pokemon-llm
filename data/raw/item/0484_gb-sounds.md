## Identity & Utility
**GB Sounds** is a **Key Item (Gameplay Utility)** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** A specialized music player that, when activated via a single switch, replaces the current background music with its original 8-bit chiptune equivalent. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold; it remains permanently in the player's inventory once acquired.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Key Items pocket, it toggles a "nostalgia filter" over the game's audio. It swaps the remastered Generation IV orchestral/MIDI arrangements for the original 8-bit tracks from the Game Boy Color era (*Pokémon Gold, Silver, and Crystal*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides a purely aesthetic audio overlay and has no impact on battle mechanics, stats, or RNG.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is a standalone "Game Design" utility intended for veteran players. Note that for tracks added in the remakes that did not exist in the original GBC games (such as certain new routes or facilities), the GB Sounds creates a "demastered" 8-bit style arrangement to maintain consistency.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut games (*HeartGold/SoulSilver*), it is a post-game reward. It is obtained from a Game Freak developer NPC in the Celadon Mansion (Celadon City) only after the player has successfully earned all 16 Gym Badges from both the Johto and Kanto regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind device given to the trainer to celebrate their journey through the reimagined Johto and Kanto regions.
