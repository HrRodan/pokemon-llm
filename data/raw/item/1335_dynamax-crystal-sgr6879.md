## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR6879** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A consumable event-trigger item used exclusively at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of the Galar region. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that cannot be purchased through standard Poke Marts; it is traditionally distributed via serial codes or special promotions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Symbolic/Not for sale**; the low cost is a placeholder for an item intended for event distribution rather than retail).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty Raid Den in the Wild Area), this crystal activates a specific Max Raid Battle. This particular crystal (SGR6879) is programmed to summon a **Gigantamax Copperajah**. The raid remains active until the end of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is used to guarantee an encounter with a Pokémon possessing the **Gigantamax Factor**, high individual values (IVs), and potentially its Hidden Ability, which are essential for building competitive teams in the Sword & Shield era.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon use at the Watchtower Lair. It does not evolve Pokémon, but it is the only way to trigger this specific "Hidden" raid encounter outside of standard den resets or online events.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional bonus. Specifically, the SGR6879 crystal was associated with a **CoroCoro Comic** promotion and retail distributions in various regions (such as GameStop or GAME) to provide players access to a Gigantamax Copperajah raid.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-exclusive resource.
