## Identity & Utility
**Green Shard** is a **Collectible** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A small, vibrant fragment of an ancient implement. While it possesses no direct functional use in battle or the overworld, it is a highly valued "Currency Item" used for bartering with specific NPCs (Move Tutors and Collectors). It is a **Consumable Trade Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate Value). While it has a sell price, its value as a trade resource for rare moves and items far exceeds its monetary worth.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a tradeable resource for various high-value services across different regions:
    * **Hoenn (Gen III):** Can be traded to the Treasure Hunter on Route 124 in exchange for a **Leaf Stone**.
    * **Sinnoh (Diamond/Pearl):** Trading ten shards to the collector on Route 212 yields **TM07 (Hail)**.
    * **Sinnoh (Platinum):** Used as currency for **Move Tutors** on Route 212, Snowpoint City, and the Survival Area.
    * **Johto (HeartGold/SoulSilver):** Traded to Jugglers in Violet City or Fuchsia City for bundles of **Berries** (e.g., Aguav, Lum, Rawst, or Durin, Hondew, Wepear).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** The item itself has no competitive viability in battle. However, it is historically essential for "Move Tutor" access, allowing Pokémon to learn competitive staples like *Seed Bomb* or *Giga Drain* in older generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates evolution for Pokémon requiring a **Leaf Stone** (via the Hoenn trade), such as Gloom, Weepinbell, and Exeggcute.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sinnoh:** Primarily obtained through the **Underground** mining mechanic.
    * **Unova:** Often found in shimmering dust clouds within caves.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Relicanth** (5% chance). Farming Relicanth using the **Thief** or **Covet** moves is the most reliable way to accumulate these shards outside of specialized mini-games like the Underground.
* **Lore:** The item is described as a fragment of an ancient tool, suggesting that Shards may be the shattered remains of ancient Evolution Stones or ceremonial objects from a previous era of the Pokémon world.
