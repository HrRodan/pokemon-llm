## Identity & Utility
**Brave Mint** is a **Nature-Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal herb with a distinct aroma. When consumed, it modifies a Pokémon's stat growth patterns to match the **Brave** nature (+Attack, -Speed). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is typically not available through standard early-game Marts, requiring specialized currency or endgame access.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Note: While the base data lists 20, in-game acquisition typically costs **50 Battle Points (BP)** or **20,000 Poké Dollars** in later generations, making it an **Expensive Specialty Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently alters the Pokémon’s stat multipliers. The **Attack** stat will receive a 10% increase, while the **Speed** stat will receive a 10% decrease. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Niche.** The Brave Mint is a "Quality of Life" staple for competitive players. It is specifically used to optimize **Physical Sweepers** meant for **Trick Room** teams, where a lower Speed stat allows the Pokémon to move first. It is essential for fixing the stats of Legendary or Shiny Pokémon that were caught with sub-optimal natures.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** change the Pokémon's actual Nature (for breeding purposes or Ability interactions like *Synchronize*); it only changes the numerical stat calculation. It does not trigger any evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in post-game locations such as the **Battle Tower** (Sword/Shield) or **Chansey Supply** shops (Scarlet/Violet). It can occasionally be found as a rare sparkling pickup in high-level areas like the Crown Tundra or Area Zero.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, Mints are treated as rare botanical rewards for high-level trainers and are not part of any standard wild Pokémon loot table.
