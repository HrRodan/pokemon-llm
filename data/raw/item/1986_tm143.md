## Identity & Utility
**TM143 (Blizzard)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that provides the knowledge for the move **Blizzard**. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked. It is a **High-Tier Special Attack** machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In the Paldea region, it is acquired via the **TM Machine** using 12,000 LP and specific Pokémon materials (5x Snorunt Fur, 3x Snover Berries, 3x Cryogonal Ice).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Blizzard** to compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Type:** Ice (Special).
    * **Power:** 110 | **Accuracy:** 70%.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to freeze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be flung or have no unique Fling effect in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High.** Blizzard is a staple in competitive play (VGC and Smogon), particularly on "Snow" (formerly Hail) teams. Under the **Snow** weather condition, Blizzard bypasses accuracy checks to become a 100% accurate move. In Double Battles, it hits both opposing Pokémon, making it a premier spread-damage move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily compatible with Ice-type Pokémon, "bulky" Water-types, and various Legendary Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the overworld of the Paldea region (often in snowy/mountainous biomes like Glaseado Mountain) or crafted at any Pokémon Center TM Machine. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required for its creation are gathered by defeating wild **Snorunt**, **Snover/Abomasnow**, and **Cryogonal**.
* **Context:** Historically, Blizzard was TM14 in earlier generations; the shift to TM143 reflects the expanded TM library in the Generation IX "All-Machines" index.
