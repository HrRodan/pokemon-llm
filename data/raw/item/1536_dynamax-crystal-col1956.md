## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (col1956)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-only Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This item is a special consumable used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It serves as a beacon to summon a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Restricted**). While it has a technical cost in the data, it is not sold in Poke Marts and is primarily distributed via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area), it triggers a **Max Raid Battle** featuring a specific Pokémon encounter. The "col1956" variant specifically corresponds to an event distribution for **Gigantamax Meowth** (Galar-form distribution).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is an out-of-battle utility item used for collection and raiding. However, the Pokémon caught from the resulting raid may have competitive value (e.g., Gigantamax-capable Meowth for "Gold Rush" money farming).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the crystal is consumed and the raid remains active until defeated or until the daily reset.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-exclusive item**. It was typically distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Best Buy, or CoroCoro) or as a pre-order bonus for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is never found via the **Pickup** ability or other in-game farming methods; it is strictly a promotional acquisition.
