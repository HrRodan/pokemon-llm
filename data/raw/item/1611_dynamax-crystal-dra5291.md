## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA5291)** is a **Special Event Item** categorized under **Dynamax Crystals**, introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, the specific Pokémon raid remains available until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for Sale/Special Acquisition**). The nominal cost is a technical placeholder; this item is traditionally obtained via serial codes or promotional distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it summons a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. Based on the "DRA" designation and internal indexing, this crystal specifically triggers an encounter with **Duraludon**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld encounter generation and has no utility within a Pokémon battle. Its value lies in providing early or guaranteed access to a Gigantamax-capable or high-IV Pokémon for a player's roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess the **Gigantamax Factor** or Hidden Abilities, which are essential for competitive team building in the Sword & Shield VGC formats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **promotional bonus**. Specifically, DRA5291 was historically associated with serial codes provided via retail partnerships (such as the *Pokémon Sword & Pokémon Shield Double Pack* or specific magazine promotions like *CoroCoro*). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a "gift" item intended to facilitate a unique encounter.
* **Location Context:** The **Watchtower Lair** is the only location where this item can be consumed. Using the crystal ensures a 5-star or specific-tier raid that is otherwise dependent on RNG or wishing pieces.
