## Identity & Utility
**White-apricorn** is an **Apricorn-box** ingredient introduced in **Generation II** (Johto region), with its data refined in Generation IV.
* **Description:** A specialized, odorless fruit used as a raw material for artisan craftsmanship. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that is primarily used to create custom Poké Balls. While it has a technical price value, it is traditionally harvested from the environment rather than purchased at standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the Johto region (HeartGold/SoulSilver), it can be given to the master craftsman **Kurt in Azalea Town**. After a 24-hour waiting period, Kurt transforms the White Apricorn into a **Fast Ball**—a specialized Poké Ball with a higher catch rate for Pokémon with a base Speed of 100 or more, or those prone to fleeing.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility ingredient for the overworld and provides no strategic advantage in a competitive battle setting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Pokéathlon:** In Generation IV, it can be placed in an Apricorn Shaker to create **Aprijuice**, which primarily boosts a Pokémon's **Speed** stat for Pokéathlon competitions.
    * **Evolution:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found on Apricorn trees throughout the **Johto Region**. Notable locations include **Route 38** and the **Pewter City** area in Kanto (HGSS). In some titles, it may be available via the Pokeathlon Dome's Athlete Shop.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be gathered from the overworld or earned through specific mini-game rewards.
* **Lore context:** Apricorns represent the traditional, pre-industrial method of catching Pokémon before the mass production of Poké Balls by corporations like Silph Co. and Devon Corp. The White Apricorn is unique for its lack of scent and its association with speed-enhancing properties.
