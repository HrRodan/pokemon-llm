## Identity & Utility
**TR35** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc that teaches the move **Uproar**. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic one-time-use mechanic for high-value or powerful moves. 
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive; often exchanged for **Watts** in its debut region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Uproar** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Uproar (Move):** A Special Normal-type move with 90 Base Power. The user attacks for three consecutive turns. While the user is in an "uproar," no Pokémon on the battlefield can fall asleep, and any sleeping Pokémon are immediately woken up.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (Notably high damage for a Fling-based attack, though using a TR as ammunition is generally inefficient).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Technical. While Uproar provides solid base power and a hard counter to **Sleep-based strategies** (like *Spore* or *Yawn*), the mechanic of being "locked" into the move for three turns makes the user vulnerable to Ghost-types or defensive pivots. It is often outperformed by *Hyper Voice* or *Boomburst* in standard play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time teaching tool that disappears after a single successful application.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR35 is primarily found in the **Galar Wild Area**. It is not sold in traditional Poké Marts but is frequently available from **Watt Traders** for a variable price in Watts. 
* **Max Raid Battles:** It is a common drop reward for defeating **Normal-type Pokémon** in Max Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a technological artifact distributed through Galar's specialized Raid and Watt-based economy.
