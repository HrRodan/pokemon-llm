## Identity & Utility
**Kommonium Z** is a **Species-Specific Z-Crystal** (categorized as a unique Held Item) introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** A crystallized form of Z-Power that interfaces specifically with Kommo-o's biology. It is a **Held Item** that is not consumed upon use, though its primary function can only be activated once per battle. As a Z-Crystal, it cannot be traded or held by a Pokémon during a trade.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique item obtained through story progression.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If held by a **Kommo-o** that knows the move **Clanging Scales**, the move can be upgraded into the exclusive Z-Move: **Clangorous Soulblaze**.
    * **Clangorous Soulblaze:** A massive Dragon-type area-of-effect attack (185 Base Power) that deals damage to all adjacent opponents. Upon successful execution, it **raises the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple** in Generation VII. This item transformed Kommo-o into a "win condition" Pokémon. The "Omni-boost" (raising all stats at once) while simultaneously dealing heavy spread damage made it a premier threat in both Smogon Singles and VGC 2018/2019 formats.
    * **Mechanic Protection:** This item cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief* or *Magician*, or suppressed by *Embargo* or *Magic Room*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is found at the **Plains Grotto** on Poni Island. It is guarded by a Totem Kommo-o (or found in the pedestal after the trial). 
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** Unlike generic Z-Crystals (like Dragonium Z), the Kommonium Z represents a perfect resonance between the trainer's Z-Ring and the specific life force of the Jangmo-o evolutionary line, allowing for a burst of power that enhances every physical and mental attribute of the Pokémon.
