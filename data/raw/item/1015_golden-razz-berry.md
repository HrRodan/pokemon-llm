## Identity & Utility
**Golden Razz Berry** is a **Catching-Bonus Berry** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** An upgraded, rare variant of the standard Razz Berry. It is used during encounters to drastically increase the success rate of catching a wild Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that is used from the bag during the catch phase rather than held in battle.
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price reflects its status as a "Master-tier" consumable for securing rare or Legendary encounters.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a wild Pokémon, it applies a significant multiplier to the Catch Rate (significantly higher than the standard Razz Berry or Silver Razz Berry). In the *Let's Go* engine, it turns the capture ring color toward green, indicating a much higher success probability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Because it is not designed for traditional held-item combat, its Fling utility is negligible.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item does not exist in the standard competitive circuit (VGC/Smogon) as it lacks a held-effect in battle. It is a specialized utility item for **completionists and Shiny hunters.**
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard berries (e.g., Oran, Lum), it cannot be held by Pokémon to trigger effects in battle. It is strictly a trainer-to-wild-Pokémon interaction tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Let's Go*, it is primarily found as a rare hidden item in high-level areas like **Cerulean Cave**. In the broader franchise context (*Pokémon GO*), it is a prestigious reward for completing Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is typically gathered through environmental exploration (hidden item spots) or as a reward for high-tier gameplay milestones. It is considered the "pinnacle" of the Razz Berry family tree.
