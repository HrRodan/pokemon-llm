## Identity & Utility
**Passho Berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable held item that functions as a defensive countermeasure. When held by a Pokémon, it automatically triggers to mitigate damage from incoming Water-type moves. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is generally not for sale in standard marts, requiring cultivation or foraging.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard Berry value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is struck by a **super-effective Water-type attack**, the Passho Berry is consumed to **halve (50% reduction)** the damage taken from that specific hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; typically not recommended for Fling strategies unless the goal is to transfer the berry to an ally).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Water-type** attack with **80 Base Power** (Gen 5+).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a niche **Competitive Staple** in formats like VGC (Doubles). It is frequently used on Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Water (e.g., Rhyperior, Magcargo) or high-value Fire/Ground types (e.g., Groudon, Volcarona) to survive a surprise Hydro Pump or Scald, allowing for a counter-attack or setup.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its consumption can trigger abilities like **Unburden** or **Cheek Pouch**, and it is affected by **Unnerve**, which prevents the opponent from eating it.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through berry trees, the Berry Master, or specialized shops in later generations. It is part of the "Resist Berry" cycle designed to balance the elemental rock-paper-scissors mechanics.
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is notably carried by wild **Phanpy**, **Donphan**, **Pansear**, and **Simisear**. Trainers often use the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief/Covet** to farm these from wild populations to build a competitive inventory.
