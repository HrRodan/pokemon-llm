## Identity & Utility
**TM225 (Hard Press)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** during the *The Indigo Disk* expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. In this iteration, it teaches the move **Hard Press**, a Steel-type physical attack. As an "All-machine" category item in the Paldean/Unovan regions, it is consumed upon use but can be crafted repeatedly at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using 400 League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hard Press** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Hard Press Mechanics:** A Physical Steel-type move. Its power is calculated based on the target's remaining HP. The formula is approximately $100 \times (\text{Current HP} / \text{Max HP})$. This makes it exceptionally powerful against healthy opponents (reaching up to 100 Base Power) and weaker as the target's health dwindles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible effect; TMs are generally not used for Fling strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/High Utility.** It serves as a reliable Physical Steel-type alternative to *Iron Head* (for more immediate power) or *Heavy Slam* (which depends on weight). It is particularly effective on physical attackers like **Metagross**, **Iron Crown**, and **Orthworm** to punish switch-ins or lead Pokémon with full HP.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide range of Steel-type Pokémon and bulky physical attackers found in the Blueberry Academy Terarium.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item within the **Terarium** (specifically the **Savanna Biome**) in the Blueberry Academy. Once obtained, it is unlocked for crafting at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM225, the player typically requires:
    * **400 LP**
    * **3x Beldum Claw**
    * **3x Revaroom Spark**
    * **3x Orthworm Tarnish**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. The materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Beldum**, **Revaroom**, and **Orthworm** (often optimized via the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature).
