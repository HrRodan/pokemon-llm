## Identity & Utility
**Red Shard** is a **Collectible / Exchange Currency** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A small, jagged fragment of an ancient, red-colored implement. It is a **Holdable Utility Item** that cannot be used directly from the bag for any immediate effect. While it has a listed price, its true value is as a barter currency for specialized NPCs.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate value; typically hoarded for trading rather than sold for profit).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Red Shard has no direct effect in or out of battle. It functions as a **Trade Requirement** for various specialists across different regions:
    * **TM Acquisition (Sinnoh - D/P):** Trade 10 Red Shards for **TM11 (Sunny Day)** on Route 212.
    * **Move Tutors (Sinnoh - Platinum / Unova - B2W2):** Acts as the primary currency for Move Tutors. In Platinum, it is required for teaching various moves in Snowpoint City and the Survival Area. In Black 2/White 2, it is traded in Driftveil City for moves like *Fire Punch*, *Iron Head*, and *Seed Bomb*.
    * **Berry Trading (Johto/Kanto - HG/SS):** Traded to Jugglers for bundles of Berries (e.g., Cheri, Leppa, and Pecha Berries).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression and utility item used exclusively for team building via Move Tutors, rather than active combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily categorized under the "Underground" attribute, identifying it as a collectible found through mining mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Mining:** Frequently found in the **Sinnoh Underground** via the mining minigame.
    * **Environment:** Often obtained by using **Rock Smash** on fragile rocks in Hoenn and Johto or finding hidden items on the ocean floor (Dive).
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Corsola** (typically a 5% encounter rate). In various games, players can farm these by using moves like *Thief* or *Covet*, or by utilizing the **Pickup** ability at specific level tiers.
* **Lore:** The item is flavor-texted as a "fragment of some sort of implement made long ago," suggesting it is a remnant of ancient human craftsmanship, possibly from an era before modern Poké Balls and TMs were standardized.
