## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (VIR4540)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event-driven consumable used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot** be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible**; this is a nominal value for internal database logic as the item is distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it emits a beam of light that forces a specific Pokémon encounter to appear. While the internal data uses a variable placeholder `[VAR (0000)]`, these "VIR" crystals were historically used for retail distributions (such as those from GameStop or CoroCoro) to encounter rare Pokémon like Gigantamax Sandaconda or Centiskorch.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld Raid triggering to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon, often with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but the resulting Raid Battle is a primary method for obtaining Pokémon capable of **Gigantamaxing**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Pokémon Marts. It was distributed via **Serial Codes** during specific promotional periods in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. Once used, the crystal is consumed, and the raid remains active until defeated or until the day ends.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is an "Other Item" category meant for event progression, similar to a Key Item but consumable in nature. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
