## Identity & Utility
**X-Attack-3** is a **Miracle Shooter** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized battle-only enhancement used to drastically increase physical offensive power. Unlike standard battle items, it is specifically tied to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic. It is a **Consumable** item that cannot be purchased with traditional currency or used in the standard overworld.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired exclusively via points accumulated during Wonder Launcher battles).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during battle, it **raises the target’s Attack stat by three stages** (+150% of the base stat). The effect is temporary and wears off if the Pokémon is withdrawn from battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in standard VGC or Smogon formats. Its utility is restricted entirely to the niche "Wonder Launcher" battle mode in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2,* and *White 2*. Within that specific format, it is a high-tier offensive buff for physical sweepers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It exists as part of the "X" item hierarchy but is functionally distinct from the standard X Attack found in Poké Marts.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts or found as hidden loot in the overworld. It is generated during wireless/online battles when the **Wonder Launcher** setting is enabled, costing a high number of points earned over the course of turns.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is essentially a digital construct within the Unova region’s advanced battle simulators.
