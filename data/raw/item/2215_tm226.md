## Identity & Utility
**TM226 (Dragon Cheer)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A specialized machine used to teach the move **Dragon Cheer**. In the context of the Paldea/Blueberry Academy era, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It must be acquired through exploration or crafted at the TM Machine using specific materials (typically Tatsugiri Scales and Lapras Teardrops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Cheer**. This move is a Dragon-type status move that raises the critical-hit ratio of the user's allies.
    * **Bonus Mechanic:** If the recipient is a **Dragon-type**, their critical-hit ratio increases by two stages; otherwise, it increases by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **VGC (Doubles) Niche Staple**. It is used to support powerful attackers by turning them into crit-machines, particularly when paired with items like Scope Lens or abilities like Sniper. It has virtually no utility in Single Battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This TM is a **mandatory evolution item/trigger**. A **Duraludon** will only evolve into **Archaludon** when it levels up while knowing the move taught by this TM (Dragon Cheer).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found in the **Blueberry Academy (Terarium)** after defeating the Elite Four member **Drayton**. Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked for crafting at any TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial instructional device created by the Blueberry Academy's technical curriculum.
* **Lore Context:** The move reflects the communal and empowering nature of Dragon-type trainers in the Unova region's Blueberry Academy, emphasizing synergy between teammates rather than raw individual power.
