## Identity & Utility
**Tapunium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically tuned to the energies of the Alolan Island Guardians. It is a specialized **Held Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or traded. Unlike standard Z-Crystals that correspond to move types (like Electrium Z), this is a species-specific crystal.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Tapu Koko**, **Tapu Lele**, **Tapu Bulu**, or **Tapu Fini**, it allows the user to upgrade the move **Nature's Madness** into the exclusive Z-Move: **Guardian of Alola**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Guardian of Alola Mechanics:** While the base move (Nature's Madness) deals damage equal to 50% of the target's remaining HP, the Z-Move version deals fixed damage equal to **75% of the target's remaining HP**.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed by moves like Knock Off, Thief, or Trick.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** In VGC and Smogon formats during Gen VII, it was used as a "wall-breaker." Because it deals percentage-based damage, it is one of the few ways to nearly Shore-up a KO on extremely bulky threats regardless of their defensive investment. However, it is often passed over for Terrain Extenders or Choice items which provide more consistent utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item only functions with the four **Island Guardians**. It has no effect when held by any other Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Special Story Acquisition. In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the player receives this crystal after defeating or catching **Tapu Koko** at the Ruins of Conflict during the post-game narrative (following the first Hall of Fame induction).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique item tied to Alolan lore and the player's status as the Island Challenge Champion.
