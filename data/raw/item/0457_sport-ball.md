## Identity & Utility
**Sport Ball** (historically known as the Park Ball in Generation II) is a **Specialized Poké Ball** categorized under **Standard-Balls**. While its data reflects a Generation IV classification (due to its re-introduction in the HeartGold/SoulSilver National Park), it is deeply rooted in Johto heritage.
* **Description:** A unique Poké Ball specifically designed for use within the Bug-Catching Contest. It features a distinct orange shell with a white "S" or Poké Ball symbol. It is a **Consumable** item that is typically provided as a temporary tool during specific events rather than being purchased at a standard Poké Mart.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**). In most games, this cost is a placeholder as the ball is provided for free during contests or obtained through rare crafting mechanics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in battle against a wild Pokémon, it attempts a capture with a **1.5× Catch Rate multiplier**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung for damage/effect in standard scenarios).
    * **Competitive Use:** No direct impact on combat stats. In the competitive scene, the Sport Ball is highly valued as a **"Status Symbol"** or for **Aesthetics**. Since Pokémon caught in this ball can pass the ball type down through breeding, it is often sought after for "Aesthetic Matching" (e.g., matching the orange/red color scheme with Bug-type Pokémon like Scizor or Volcarona).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is functionally identical to a Great Ball in terms of catch success (1.5x) but is restricted by extreme rarity in modern titles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Legacy:** Exclusively available during the **Bug-Catching Contest** in Johto’s National Park. Trainers are given 20 Sport Balls to catch the best Bug-type Pokémon possible.
    * **Modern (Gen VIII/IX):** Extremely rare. In *Sword & Shield*, it can be obtained via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor (0.1% chance). In *Scarlet & Violet*, it is a rare reward from the **Item Printer** or the **Ace Academy Tournament**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be obtained through specific regional events or high-tier item crafting/rewards. Unlike the Poké Ball or Great Ball, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability, contributing to its status as one of the rarest Poké Ball types in the franchise.
