## Identity & Utility
**Pokémon Box** is a **Key Item** (classified in data as "unused") introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!).
* **Description:** It represents the player's portable storage system, allowing for the management of caught Pokémon while traveling. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the context of the *Let's Go* series, this item allows the player to access their Pokémon Storage Boxes directly from the Bag menu at almost any time, removing the requirement to visit a PC at a Pokémon Center to swap party members. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a quality-of-life mechanical item used exclusively during the main story and post-game exploration to facilitate team management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. It functions as a permanent UI/system upgrade rather than a physical tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Received as a mandatory story item early in the adventure in *Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*. In later generations, this functionality was integrated into the "Pokémon Box Link" or became a standard feature of the player's Rotom Phone/Bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind functional item.
