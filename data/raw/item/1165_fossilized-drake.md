## Identity & Utility
**Fossilized Drake** is a **Dex-completion / Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An ancient fossil fragment representing the lower body of an extinct land-dwelling Pokémon. Unlike traditional fossils that contain a complete DNA blueprint, this item is a "mismatched" fossil piece that must be combined with another fossil type to produce a hybrid prehistoric Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item used during the restoration process.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high sell price, it is primarily obtained through gameplay mechanics rather than standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the researcher **Cara Liss** on Route 6 in the Galar region, it can be combined with a second fossil to "resurrect" a hybrid Pokémon. 
    * **Fossilized Drake + Fossilized Bird:** Results in **Dracozolt** (Electric/Dragon).
    * **Fossilized Drake + Fossilized Fish:** Results in **Dracovish** (Water/Dragon).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High physical damage, though the item is consumed upon use).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no held-item benefit, it is the mandatory catalyst for obtaining **Dracovish**, which became one of the most dominant threats in Generation VIII competitive play (Smogon and VGC) due to its "Strong Jaw" ability and the move "Fishious Rend."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It functions as a revival component. It does not evolve a specific Pokémon but is required for the creation of Galar's unique "Chimera" fossil group.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained via the **Digging Duo** in the Bridge Field area of the Galar Wild Area. 
    * In **Pokémon Shield**, it is a "Common" find from the Skill brother.
    * In **Pokémon Sword**, it is a "Rare" find, making it significantly harder to acquire without trading or extensive digging.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is recovered from the earth, reflecting its status as a geological remnant.
* **Lore Context:** The Fossilized Drake is a satirical take on the historical "Bone Wars" and early paleontological errors where scientists mistakenly assembled skeletons from unrelated species. In-game, it represents the lower "Dragon-type" half of the Galar fossils.
