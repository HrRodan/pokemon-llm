## Identity & Utility
**TM209 (Lunge)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item is a reusable (single-use per instance, but craftable) machine used to teach the move **Lunge** to compatible Pokémon. As a TM in the modern Paldean ecosystem, it represents a data module for move learning. It is a **Consumable** teaching tool that cannot be bought with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Scarlet & Violet*, this item must be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials, typically requiring 3,000 LP, 3 Maschiff Teeth, and 3 Dewpider Threads.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Lunge** to a Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Lunge is a **Bug-type Physical move** with a base power of 80 and 100% accuracy. 
    * **Secondary Effect:** It is guaranteed (100% chance) to lower the target's **Attack stat** by one stage upon a successful hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly valued as a **Utility/Offensive** hybrid move. It is particularly effective in VGC (Doubles) and Singles for neutering physical attackers like Great Tusk or Roaring Moon while still dealing respectable damage. It provides Bug-type coverage with built-in survivability by weakening the opponent's physical output.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily utilized by physical attackers and Bug-types (e.g., Lokix, Araquanid, or Scizor) to provide offensive pressure and debuffing support.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the **Terarium (Blueberry Academy)** during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. It is often located as a collectible item ball in the Savanna or Canyon Biomes. Once found, the recipe is unlocked at any TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it must be gathered from wild **Maschiff/Mabosstiff** and **Dewpider/Araquanid** (often optimized via **Let's Go!** mode or sandwich powers).
