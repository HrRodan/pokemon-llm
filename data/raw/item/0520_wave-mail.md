## Identity & Utility
**Wave Mail** is a **Social/Mail Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A stationary item featuring a stylized Wailmer print. It is a **Consumable Held Item** used to facilitate communication between players during trades. Once a message is written, the item is given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message using a predetermined list of words/phrases. When a Pokémon holding Wave Mail is traded, the recipient can read the message. The message can be deleted to make the Mail reusable or stored in the PC for posterity.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling in the generations where they are functional).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Defensive Utility.** In older generations, Mail has a unique mechanical property: it **cannot be removed or stolen** in battle. Moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Covet*, and *Trick* will fail against a Pokémon holding Mail. While it provides no stat boosts, it was occasionally used in specific historical formats to "Trick-proof" a Pokémon, though this comes at the high opportunity cost of not holding a more impactful item like Leftovers or a Choice item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system; the Mail must be removed first. 
    * **No Removal:** Prevents the holder from losing its item to opponent mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in seaside locations or specific major cities (such as Slateport City in Hoenn). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon; it is an artificial consumer product within the Pokémon world.
* **Thematic Design:** As part of the Generation III "Mail" collection, the Wave Mail features a **Wailmer** print, reflecting the Hoenn region's heavy emphasis on marine life and water-based travel.
