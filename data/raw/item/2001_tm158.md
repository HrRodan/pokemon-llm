## Identity & Utility
**TM158 (Breaking Swipe)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In the current generation, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced using the TM Machine. This specific TM contains the move **Breaking Swipe**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration in the Terarium or crafted using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Breaking Swipe** to a Pokémon.
    * **Move Profile:** Dragon-type, Physical, 60 Power, 100% Accuracy.
    * **Secondary Effect:** The user swings its tough tail as its attack, hitting all adjacent opponents. It lowers the Attack stat of those hit by one stage (100% trigger rate).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines generally cannot be thrown or have no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Viable (VGC/Doubles).** Breaking Swipe is a premier utility move in Double Battles because it is a "spread move" that hits both opponents simultaneously while providing guaranteed Attack-lowering (debuffing) utility, effectively neutering physical attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time-use item that disappears upon use unless additional copies are crafted.
