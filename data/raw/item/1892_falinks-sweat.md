## Identity & Utility
**Falinks Sweat** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item represents biological matter (perspiration) shed by Falinks during combat or exertion. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common**). While it has a low sell price, its primary value lies in the "LP" (League Points) conversion or as a component in move creation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is required to craft specific TMs that match Falinks's move pool or thematic archetype (typically Fighting-type or physical combat moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle economy item used solely for inventory management and move acquisition during the story or post-game team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is not affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it is a material drop rather than a standard held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea region**. It is acquired by defeating or catching wild **Falinks**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop from wild **Falinks** (found in locations such as West Province Area Two and North Province Area Two). In the ecosystem of the games, this material signifies the disciplined, intense training of the "Formation Pokémon."
