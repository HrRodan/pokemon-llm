## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PSC510** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot** be bought through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily distributed via serial codes or special promotions rather than retail purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-region of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal disappears and triggers a red beam of light. This beam initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon associated with the "PSC510" designation. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching rare Pokémon or obtaining Gigantamax forms in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The encounter triggered by this crystal is unique and persists even if the player loses the battle, lasting until midnight of the day it was activated. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively through **Serial Codes** provided by retail partners (such as GameStop, EB Games, or Pokémon Center stores) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* expansion passes or specific movie promotions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an event-based acquisition.
* **Lore Context:** In the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals are rare conduits of Galar Particles that can force a "Power Spot" to manifest at the long-abandoned Watchtower Lair, providing trainers access to rare specimens that do not naturally occur in that specific den.
