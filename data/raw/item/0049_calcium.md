## Identity & Utility
**Calcium** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation I** (refined in Gen IV data).
* **Description:** A nutritious, high-grade drink designed for Pokémon. It is a consumable enhancement item used to permanently increase a Pokémon's potential. It can be used both in the overworld and during battle (though battle use is rare and typically limited to friendship boosting).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-End Medical Supplement**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a single Pokémon's **Special Attack Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. Additionally, it provides a minor boost to the Pokémon's **Happiness/Friendship** (5, 3, or 2 points depending on the current friendship level).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Core Training Staple**. While it provides no tactical advantage *during* a match, it is essential for preparing "Special Sweepers" (e.g., Gengar, Alakazam) for competitive play in VGC or Smogon formats. 
* **Mechanic Evolution:** 
    * **Legacy (Gen 1-7):** Could not be used if the Pokémon already had 100 or more Special Attack EVs.
    * **Modern (Gen 8-9):** The 100 EV cap was removed; it can now be used until the Pokémon reaches its maximum of 252 Special Attack EVs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically purchased at large **Department Stores** (such as those in Celadon, Goldenrod, or Lilycove City) or specialized Apothecaries. In later generations, it can also be purchased in bulk using Battle Points (BP) or LP (League Points).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In certain games, it can be gathered by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability once they reach a high level (typically Level 71+).
* **Context:** Part of the "Vitamin" suite alongside Protein, Iron, Carbos, Zinc, and HP Up. It represents the "Special" equivalent to Protein.
