## Identity & Utility
**HM04 (Strength)** is a **Hidden Machine (HM)** introduced in **Generation I** (though the provided data focuses on its metadata from Generation III onwards).
* **Description:** It is a permanent teaching device used to instruct a compatible Pokémon in the move **Strength**. As an HM, it is a **Key Item** that is intended for multiple uses and cannot be consumed or sold. It serves as a critical "utility gate" in the Pokémon world, allowing players to bypass environmental obstacles.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is traditionally obtained as a gift from an NPC or found during exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Strength**. Strength is a Normal-type Physical move with **80 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. 
* **Field Utility:** Outside of battle, Strength allows the player to push large, circular boulders into holes or out of pathways to solve puzzles and access new areas of the map.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (As a Technical/Hidden Machine, it cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Staple.** While 80 Base Power is respectable for a mid-game Normal-type move, it is almost strictly outclassed in competitive play by *Return* (which has 102 BP at max friendship) or *Body Slam* (which offers a 30% paralysis chance). It is primarily used during the main story to consolidate a decent attacking move with necessary field utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike TMs in later generations, HMs like HM04 historically could not be forgotten easily; a "Move Deleter" NPC is typically required to remove the move from a Pokémon's skillset.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via story progression. Notable locations include:
    * **Kanto:** Given by the Safari Zone Warden after returning his Gold Teeth.
    * **Hoenn:** Given by an NPC in Rusturf Tunnel after clearing the rocks.
    * **Sinnoh:** Found in the Lost Tower or given by an NPC in Canalave City.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique structural item provided to the player to ensure progression.
* **Legacy Note:** In modern titles (starting with Generation VII), the necessity of HM04 has been phased out in favor of "Poké Ride" or "Secret Techniques," though it returned as a functional TM/HM in the *Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl* remakes.
