## Identity & Utility
**TM95 (Snarl)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A teaching device used to grant a compatible Pokémon the move **Snarl**. The move is a Dark-type special attack where the user rants at the opposition, demoralizing them and weakening their magical/special resolve. It is a reusable machine in most iterations (Gen V–VIII), though its consumption rules vary in the most recent generations.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Snarl** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Snarl is a Dark-type Special move that deals damage to all adjacent opponents (in Doubles/VGC) and has a **guaranteed 100% chance** to lower the Special Attack stat of the target(s) by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines typically cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **VGC/Doubles Staple.** Snarl is one of the most important utility moves in competitive doubles. Its ability to hit both opponents while simultaneously reducing their offensive pressure makes it a premier choice for support-oriented Pokémon and bulky "tanks." It effectively neuters Special Attackers like Flutter Mane or Calyrex-Shadow.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is widely compatible with many "beast-like" or "intimidating" Pokémon (e.g., Arcanine, Incineroar, Zoroark, and various Dark and Normal types).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Gen V:** Originally exclusive to a special event involving the "Lock Capsule" in Black/White, it became more accessible in sequels.
    * **Modern Gens:** Often found in the overworld in mid-to-late game areas (e.g., Lostlorn Forest or via TM crafting in Gen IX). It is generally sold at specialized TM shops or Department Stores for a flat rate of 1,000.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an artificial device provided by NPCs, found in Poké Balls on the ground, or purchased at League-affiliated shops.
