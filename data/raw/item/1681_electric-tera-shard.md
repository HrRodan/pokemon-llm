## Identity & Utility
**Electric Tera Shard** is a specialized resource and Tera Shard introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A peculiar, crystallized fragment of energy that glows with a yellow hue. It is a **Consumable Crafting/Service Item** that cannot be used directly from the bag in battle. While it has an internal cost value, it is primarily obtained through gameplay rather than standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard resale value; primarily acquired via Raids).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Electric Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the Treasure Eatery in Medali to change a Pokémon’s **Tera Type** to **Electric**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Relevance.** In the Generation IX competitive landscape (VGC and Smogon), changing a Tera Type is foundational. The Electric Tera Type is specifically prized for:
        1. **Weakness Elimination:** Used on Pokémon with the **Levitate** ability (e.g., Hydreigon, Cresselia) to grant them a profile with zero type weaknesses.
        2. **STAB Boost:** Enhancing the power of Electric-type attackers like Miraidon or Iron Hands.
        3. **Paralysis Immunity:** Terastallizing into an Electric type grants immunity to the Paralysis status condition.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a strictly mechanical resource for the Terastal phenomenon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for defeating **Electric-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star rarity or higher). They can also be found as sparkling overworld pickups throughout the Paldea region, the Land of Kitakami, and the Blueberry Academy Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is tied to the environment and Tera Raid den rewards rather than biological occurrence.
* **Special Note:** In the *Indigo Disk* DLC, shards can also be produced using the **Cram-o-matic** or obtained via the **Item Printer** in the Science Relief Board.
