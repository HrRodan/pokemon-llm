## Identity & Utility
**Roto-Bargain** is a **Rotom Power** (Adventure Utility) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable power granted by the Rotom Pokédex. It significantly reduces the financial burden of purchasing supplies by slashing Poké Mart prices by 50%. It is a **consumable overworld utility item** that **cannot be bought**; it is earned through specific interactions.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). It has no purchase price as it is a reward-based item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated from the bag, it applies a **50% discount** to all items sold at Poké Marts and specialty shops for a limited duration. This effect is stackable with the natural progression of the game but is primarily used to mass-purchase expensive items like Vitamins, Ultra Balls, or TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is strictly a "Playthrough/Economy" item designed to ease the grind of resource gathering in the Alola region. It has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a manifestation of the "Roto Loto" mechanic, requiring a high friendship level with the Rotom Pokédex to acquire.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is obtained via the **Roto Loto**, a luck-based mini-game that triggers when the Rotom Pokédex’s eyes flash gold.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these are digital-physical hybrids stored in the "Rotom Powers" pocket of the Bag and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**.
* **Lore context:** Roto-Bargain represents the bond between a Trainer and their Rotom Dex. As the player interacts more with Rotom, it provides these "powers" to assist on the journey, serving as the Generation VII successor to the "O-Powers" of Generation VI.
