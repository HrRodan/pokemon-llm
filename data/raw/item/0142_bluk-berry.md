## Identity & Utility
**Bluk Berry** is a **Baking-only / Contest Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A berry distinguished by its deep purple/blue color. Unlike medicinal berries, it has no direct effect when consumed by a Pokémon in battle. Its primary utility is as a raw ingredient for crafting **Pokéblocks** (Hoenn) and **Poffins** (Sinnoh) to improve a Pokémon's condition for Contests.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively for planting/harvesting and as a cooking ingredient. It is a staple for increasing a Pokémon’s **Beauty** condition in Pokémon Contests.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely low damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fire-type** attack with **90 Power** (Gen VI+) or **70 Power** (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-viable** in standard competitive play (Smogon/VGC). Its only niche is within the Natural Gift mechanic as a specific coverage option, though even there, it is usually outclassed by berries with secondary beneficial effects.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is treated as a generic berry by abilities like **Harvest**, **Cheek Pouch**, or **Ripen**, though it provides no healing or stat-boost benefits upon consumption.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in berry patches throughout the Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Kalos regions. It is often provided by the Berry Master or found in early-to-mid-game routes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found held by wild Pokémon in the core series. It is usually gathered via cultivation or from NPCs.
* **Lore Context:** Known for having a dry taste. The flavor text notes that eating it will turn the consumer's tongue blue due to its intense pigmentation. In Sinnoh, it is a preferred ingredient for making sweets that Pokémon find highly palatable.
