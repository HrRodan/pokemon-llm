## Identity & Utility
**TR69** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. This specific TR teaches the move **Zen Headbutt**, a Physical Psychic-type attack. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic "disposable" machine mechanic.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard). While it has a traditional currency value, it is primarily traded for Watts in its debut generation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Zen Headbutt** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Zen Headbutt has a Base Power of 80, an Accuracy of 90%, and a 20% chance to cause the target to flinch.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. This is a relatively high Fling damage value, making it a viable emergency projectile if held, though it provides no secondary Fling effect.
    * **Competitive Use:** Zen Headbutt is a **staple coverage move** for Physical attackers who lack better Psychic-type options. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like Metagross, Iron Valiant, or Choice Band users who benefit from the flinch chance and the high Base Power for a Physical Psychic move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is a consumable machine and does not trigger evolution or interact with abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR69 is primarily acquired by defeating Psychic-type or high-level Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for Watts (W), with the stock rotating daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is exclusively a reward for raid victories or a currency-based purchase, emphasizing its status as a "reward" for Galar's Raid mechanics.
