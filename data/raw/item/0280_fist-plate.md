## Identity & Utility
**Fist Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A mystical stone tablet engraved with ancient text. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **holdable-active**, meaning its effects are persistent during battle. While it has a listed cost, it is typically treated as a rare find or key collectible rather than a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Accessible, though primarily acquired through exploration or the Underground).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held, it increases the power of the holder's **Fighting-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Multitype Interaction:** This item is essential for the Mythical Pokémon **Arceus**. When held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability, the holder’s primary type changes to **Fighting**, and the move **Judgment** also becomes Fighting-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High base damage for the move Fling, though the item is consumed upon use).
    * **Competitive Use:** While outclassed on most Fighting-types by items like *Life Orb* or *Choice Band* due to their higher damage ceiling, the Fist Plate is the **mandatory requirement** for running **Arceus-Fighting** in high-tier competitive formats (Ubers). It is also used on specific sets where the player wants a damage boost without recoil or move-locking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is part of the "Plates" group, which are significant in Sinnoh lore and mechanics. It does not trigger evolution but is recognized by the **Underground** mechanic in Gen IV.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in specific overworld locations (such as the **Oreburgh Gate** or behind the **Eterna Gym**) or unearthed via the **Underground/Grand Underground** mining minigame. In later generations, it is often found in the Hoopa rings or provided by NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It must be found as a fixed item on the ground or obtained through special regional mechanics like the Sinnoh Underground.
* **Lore:** Legend states that this plate is a fragment of the power used to shape the universe, specifically embodying the strength of the Fighting type.
