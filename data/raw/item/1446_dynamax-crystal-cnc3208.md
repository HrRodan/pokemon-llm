## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cnc3208)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, a specific Pokémon—typically an event-exclusive or rare encounter—will appear in the den until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be traditionally purchased in Poké Marts, despite its metadata value.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this is a placeholder value as the item is distributed via Serial Codes rather than standard commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the player can consume this crystal to manifest a Max Raid pillar. This allows the player and up to three other participants to battle a specific Pokémon associated with the "cnc3208" designation (likely a promotional encounter like Gigantamax Copperajah, Corviknight, or similar event distributions).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Acquisition Only.** While the item itself has no function in a competitive battle, it is a vital tool for competitive players to catch Pokémon with guaranteed high IVs, specific Hidden Abilities, or the Gigantamax Factor, which are then used in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Only.** These crystals were primarily distributed through retail serial code promotions (e.g., GameStop, Best Buy, or CoroCoro Magazine). They are not available through natural gameplay or Marts. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, Dynamax Crystals are strictly "Key-like" consumables deposited into the Treasures pocket of the Bag.
* **Context:** In Galar lore, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated masses of Galar Particles. While most Power Spots activate naturally via Wishing Pieces, these specific Crystals are "tuned" to attract a specific species of Pokémon, bypassing the randomness of standard dens.
