## Identity & Utility
**Data-Card-21** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in the Johto-based *HeartGold and SoulSilver* versions).
* **Description:** This item serves as a specialized record-keeping device for the Pokéathlon. It specifically tracks and displays the number of times the Trainer has secured a first-place victory across all possible Pokéathlon events. It is a **Key Item / Tracker** that is not consumed upon use and cannot be sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through specialized currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When accessed, it displays a specific statistic: the total count of first-place finishes the player has achieved in Pokéathlon competitions. It functions as a permanent log for completionists and those aiming to maximize their Athlete Shop potential.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a purely cosmetic and record-tracking item for the Pokéathlon mini-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution or interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz. Its utility is strictly restricted to the Pokéathlon Dome interface.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (located north of Goldenrod City in Johto). Unlike standard items, it is bought using **Pokéathlon Points (P)** rather than Poké Dollars. It is part of a series of 27 collectible Data Cards that fill the player's Data Card Album.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique achievement-based item tied to the Trainer's progress in Johto's athletic competitions.
