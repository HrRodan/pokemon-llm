## Identity & Utility
**TM148 (Sludge Bomb)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach the move **Sludge Bomb** to compatible Pokémon. As of Generation IX, TMs are once again single-use consumables that can be reproduced via the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, this item is acquired through exploration or crafted using **10,000 LP**, **3 Croagunk Poison**, **3 Grimer Toxin**, and **3 Foongus Spores**.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sludge Bomb**. Sludge Bomb is a high-tier Special Poison-type move with a **Base Power of 90** and **100% Accuracy**. It has a **30% chance to inflict the Poison status** condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling for damage in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** Sludge Bomb is the premier Special Poison-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. It is essential for Special Attackers like **Glimmora**, **Iron Moth**, and **Amoonguss** to threaten Fairy-type and Grass-type opponents. Its high poison chance makes it effective for "fishing" for status chips against defensive walls.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Not used for evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Paldea:** Found as a physical pickup in the overworld (notably in the North Province or Area Zero).
    * **TM Machine:** Once found, it can be crafted indefinitely provided the trainer has sufficient League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
    * **The Indigo Disk:** Available for use and crafting within the Blueberry Academy Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required to craft it are farmed from wild **Grimer**, **Croagunk**, and **Foongus** (often gathered via the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature).
