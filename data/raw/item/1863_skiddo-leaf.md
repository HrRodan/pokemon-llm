## Identity & Utility
**Skiddo Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Skiddo evolutionary line. As a "TM Material," it serves as a specialized currency/ingredient used at the TM Machine found in Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable** crafting item that can be exchanged for League Points (LP) or used to manufacture Technical Machines.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient in the crafting recipes for specific TMs. In the Paldea region, it is essential for teaching Grass-type and physical maneuvers to a trainer's roster.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle crafting resource. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats other than providing access to moves via the TM Machine.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Generation IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Skiddo** or **Gogoat**. It can also be found as a sparkling "pickup" item on the ground in areas where these Pokémon reside, such as the South Province or West Province of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense for battle, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Skiddo** and **Gogoat** upon their defeat or capture. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is part of the "Let's Go!" auto-battle and standard encounter reward table unique to Generation IX.
