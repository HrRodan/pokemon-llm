## Identity & Utility
**Flyinium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon that knows a Flying-type move, it allows the trainer to trigger a specialized Z-Move during battle. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; unique item obtained through Alolan trial completion or exploration).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder knows a Flying-type damaging move, this crystal upgrades it to the Z-Move **Supersonic Skystrike**. The power of the resulting Z-Move scales based on the base move's power. If used with a Flying-type status move (like *Mirror Move* or *Roost*), it adds a "Z-Power" secondary effect (e.g., Z-Mirror Move grants +2 Attack).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in the Generation VII (SM/USUM) meta. It is frequently used as a "one-time nuke" to break through defensive walls. Common users include **Landorus-Therian** (Fly/Supersonic Skystrike), **Gyarados** (Bounce/Supersonic Skystrike), and **Celesteela**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is immune to the moves **Trick**, **Switcheroo**, and **Knock Off**; it cannot be removed or stolen from the holder. It does not evolve any Pokémon but requires a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** in the trainer's possession to function.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the Flyinium Z is found on a pedestal in the deepest part of **Ten Carat Hill** (Farthest Hollow), accessible only after the player has obtained the Tauros Charge Poké Ride.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, key-adjacent item that cannot be mass-farmed. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability.
