## Identity & Utility
**Oak's Parcel** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in Generation I (refined in Generation III for *FireRed & LeafGreen*).
* **Description:** A package intended for Professor Oak, sent from the Viridian City Poké Mart. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon. It serves as the primary "gatekeeper" item for the early-game tutorial phase of the Kanto region.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When delivered to Professor Oak in his laboratory in Pallet Town, it triggers a scripted event where the player receives the **Pokédex**. This delivery effectively completes the game's opening "errand" and unlocks the ability to purchase Poké Balls from Marts and progress past the NPC blocking the path north of Viridian City.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in the Fling mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and holds no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any battle-oriented format.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the Professor Oak NPC. In the context of speedrunning or Nuzlockes, this item represents the transition from the "Intro" to the "Active Play" phase.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically by speaking to the clerk in the **Viridian City Poké Mart** after receiving a Starter Pokémon. The clerk recognizes the player as being from Pallet Town and asks them to deliver the parcel to the Professor.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The contents of the parcel are never explicitly revealed in the games, though it is widely speculated among the fanbase to contain a specialized Poké Ball or laboratory equipment requested by Oak for his research. Its presence ensures the player learns the fundamental geography of the Kanto region (navigating between Pallet Town and Viridian City) before beginning their journey in earnest.
