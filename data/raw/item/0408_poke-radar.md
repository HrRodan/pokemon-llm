## Identity & Utility
**Poke-radar** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
*   **Description:** A high-tech tool used to detect Pokémon hiding within tall grass. Unlike standard random encounters, this device visually indicates which patches of grass contain Pokémon by making them shake. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold** (Cost: 0).
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Upon activation in a patch of tall grass, the Poke-radar causes several nearby patches to shake. Entering a shaking patch triggers an encounter. 
    *   **Chaining:** If the player catches or defeats the Pokémon found, and then enters a new patch that shakes in the same way, they begin a "chain." 
    *   **Shiny Hunting:** Successive encounters with the same species increase the chain count. As the chain grows (ideally to 40), the probability of a "Shiny Patch" (a patch that sparkles) appearing increases dramatically, providing a reliable method for hunting Shiny Pokémon.
    *   **Radar-Exclusive Species:** The device reveals certain rare Pokémon that do not appear through normal wild encounters (e.g., Arundel, Tyrogue, or Ditto in specific areas).
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely out-of-battle utility item used for collection, Pokédex completion, and Shiny hunting.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** The Poke-radar requires a **50-step recharge** after every use, which is tracked by the player's movement. It cannot be used while on a Bicycle.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** In its debut (Sinnoh), it is typically gifted to the player by **Professor Rowan** after they have seen every Pokémon in the Regional Pokédex. In Generation VI (Kalos), it is obtained from a scientist in the Pokémon Research Lab in Lumiose City after entering the Hall of Fame.
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique piece of laboratory equipment. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability.
