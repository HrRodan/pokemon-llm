## Identity & Utility
**Roto-Catch** is a **Rotom Power** (categorized internally as "unused" in standard item indices) introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** One of the specialized "Rotom Powers" granted by the Rotom Dex. It serves as a temporary buff that significantly increases the success rate of catching wild Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Power-up** that cannot be bought or sold in shops.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through gameplay mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated, it applies a significant multiplier to the catch rate formula for all wild Pokémon encounters for a limited duration (typically 10 minutes or until a successful capture, depending on the specific Gen VII mechanic). It is functionally the successor to the "Capture Power" O-Powers from Generation VI.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in the Rotom Dex's internal inventory, not the player's standard bag, and cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item strictly for the Alola region's single-player experience, used primarily for filling the Pokédex or securing high-value targets like Legendaries and Ultra Beasts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is triggered via the **Roto Loto** mini-game on the Alola Pokédex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is obtained randomly via the **Roto Loto** feature, which is triggered by interacting with the Rotom Dex on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS when it displays a specific animation (yellow glowing eyes).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital "power" manifested by the Rotom inhabiting the player's Pokédex rather than a physical object found in the world.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of capture-boosting tools, Roto-Catch is superior to standard Poké Ball modifiers, as its bonus stacks with the modifiers of the Poké Ball being thrown (e.g., using a Dusk Ball under the effects of Roto-Catch).
