## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (VIR5056)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be obtained through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but serves as a placeholder as the item is typically acquired via external promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) causes a specific Pokémon—associated with the unique ID "VIR5056"—to appear as a Max Raid Battle encounter. The encounter remains active until defeated or until the day ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. This item is strictly used for overworld encounter triggering. It has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, though the Pokémon caught from the resulting raid may be used competitively.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It does not trigger evolutions or interact with standard battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is a **Special Distribution** item. These crystals were primarily distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or GAME) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* Dual Pack and the Expansion Pass. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to provide players access to specific Max Raid encounters (often Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or rare species) outside of standard raid den rotations.
