## Identity & Utility
**Electric Gem** is a **Jewel (Competitive Held Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A translucent gem containing the essence of electricity. It is a **consumable held item** that is used automatically in battle to provide a significant, one-time power boost to an Electric-type attack. While it appears inexpensive in data, it is typically a rare find rather than a common shop item.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its availability is usually limited to special overworld mechanics like Dust Clouds).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Electric-type move, the move's power is increased by **1.5×** (in its debut Generation V) and the item is consumed immediately.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** Not applicable (The item is consumed upon the move's execution, making it unavailable to be Flung unless the move fails or is suppressed).
    * **Competitive Use:** In its debut generation, the Electric Gem was a **top-tier competitive staple**, particularly in VGC (Doubles). It allowed Pokémon like Thundurus or Zapdos to secure specific One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) that would otherwise be impossible. In later generations, "Elemental Gems" (other than the Normal Gem) became largely unobtainable in standard play, and their multiplier was nerfed to 1.3× in the code.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the ability **Unburden**; once the Electric Gem is consumed, the Pokémon's Speed is doubled. It also interacts with **Recycle**, which allows the user to regain the consumed gem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in the **Unova region** within **Swirling Dust** (randomly appearing spots in caves). In later titles, it is generally unavailable or restricted to special distributions and Battle Frontier-style shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon in standard encounters. It is primarily gathered through environmental exploration or as a reward for high-level battle facilities.
* **Lore:** The item represents a crystallized form of elemental energy. Unlike "Plates" or "Magnets" which provide a permanent but smaller (20%) boost, the Gem offers an "explosive" release of energy for a tactical advantage at a specific moment in combat.
