## Identity & Utility
**Ditto Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy-packed candy. When fed to a Ditto, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily earned rather than bought.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a technical buy/sell price, it is rarely purchased in bulk from traditional marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants **+1 Awakening Value (AV)** to every single stat of a Ditto. Unlike standard stat candies (e.g., Health Candy or Quick Candy) which focus on a single attribute, Species Candies provide a comprehensive power boost. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Locked.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is used to bypass the traditional Effort Value (EV) system to maximize a Pokémon's potential (up to 200 AVs per stat). It has no effect in standard VGC or Smogon formats, where AVs are not recognized.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is species-locked; it can only be consumed by **Ditto**. Because Ditto does not evolve, this candy serves purely as a performance enhancer for the specific individual.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Ditto and transferring them to **Professor Oak**. It can also be earned as a reward for walking a Ditto with the **Poké Ball Plus** or by completing specific in-game tasks related to the species.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The most efficient "farming" method involves catching chains of wild Ditto to receive candies as catch rewards or transfer bonuses.
* **Lore Context:** In the Kanto region (Let's Go era), these candies represent a distillation of a Pokémon's essence, used by trainers to push a specific species beyond its natural limitations without the need for traditional training.
