## Identity & Utility
**Dream Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery designed to be held by a Pokémon. It allows a Trainer to compose a customizable message using a predetermined list of words, which is then delivered to another player upon trading the Pokémon. Visually, it is distinguished by featuring a print of the Pokémon currently holding it. It is a **Consumable/Social** item that is readily available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Very Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates player-to-player communication. Once a message is written and the item is given to a Pokémon, the recipient of the trade can read the message. The message can be erased to make the item reusable, or the Mail can be stored in the Trainer's PC for posterity.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Legacy Utility.** While not used for stats, Mail had a unique mechanical property in older generations: a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot be placed in the PC**, and the item **cannot be removed or stolen** by moves like *Thief*, *Knock Off*, *Covet*, or *Trick*. In specific historical casual contexts, this was used to "item-lock" a Pokémon to prevent tactical item-swapping.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the game's internal vocabulary system to prevent offensive language in trades.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Hoenn and Kanto (FRLG) regions. It is part of a wider variety of Mail types (like Orange Mail or Wood Mail) that served as the primary social mechanic before the advent of modern online communication.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or received from NPCs.
* **Legacy Note:** Mail items, including Dream Mail, have been phased out of recent Pokémon generations (starting with Gen VI), making this a "Legacy" item restricted to older hardware and titles.
