## Identity & Utility
**TM110 (Liquidation)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current iteration during **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A data disc used to teach the move **Liquidation** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be reproduced using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration in the Terarium or via crafting using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Liquidation**, a powerful Physical Water-type attack.
    * **Move Stats:** 85 Power / 100 Accuracy / 10 PP.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 20% chance to lower the target's Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier.** Liquidation is the premier physical Water-type move for many offensive threats. It is preferred over Waterfall for its higher base power and the potential to compromise the opponent's bulk through Defense drops.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used to optimize the movepools of physical attackers like **Palafin, Urshifu-Rapid-Strike, Azumarill, and Quaquaval.**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically associated with **The Indigo Disk** DLC. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground within the **Terarium** (often in the Coastal or Canyon Biomes) or rewarded by the BB League staff for defeating trainers in specific sectors.
* **Crafting Recipe:** Once unlocked, players can craft TM110 at any TM Machine using:
    * **10,000 LP**
    * **5 Arrokuda Scales**
    * **3 Wiglett Sand**
    * **3 Buizel Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial data medium. Pokémon like **Arrokuda** and **Buizel** are essentially "farmed" for the components required to manufacture this specific TM.
