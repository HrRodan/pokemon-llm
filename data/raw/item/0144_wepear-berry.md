## Identity & Utility
**Wepear Berry** is a **Baking/Contest Ingredient** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fruit primarily used as a raw material for crafting Pokémon treats. Unlike medicinal berries, it provides no direct HP or status restoration when consumed. It is a **Consumable Berry** that is technically purchasable but primarily grown and harvested.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Wepear Berry has no direct utility in battle or the overworld for healing. Its primary function is as an ingredient for **PokéBlocks** (Hoenn) and **Poffins** (Sinnoh). 
* **Flavor Profile:** It possesses a predominantly **Sour** flavor profile, making it a key ingredient for increasing a Pokémon’s **Beauty** condition, which is essential for certain Pokémon Contests and the evolution of **Feebas** into **Milotic** in specific generations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely low damage; provides no additional effect when thrown).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes an **Electric-type** attack with a base power of 70 (Gen IV-VI) or 90 (Gen VII).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-existent** in standard competitive play. Its value is strictly tied to the Contest sub-game and specific evolution mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates the evolution of **Feebas** in Generations III and IV (and Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire) by maximizing the Beauty stat through high-quality Sour PokéBlocks/Poffins.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry trees throughout the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions. It is often one of the most accessible berries in the early-to-mid game for trainers focusing on the Contest circuit.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found held by wild Pokémon in the wild (0% encounter rate in provided data); acquisition is strictly through cultivation in soft soil or NPC gifts.
* **Lore:** In the Sinnoh region, it is a staple for making regional sweets known as Poffins. Its distinct appearance and texture are optimized for cooking rather than direct consumption for energy.
