## Identity & Utility
**Yogurt** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A creamy condiment used as a component in the Picnic mechanic. It serves as a specialized ingredient for crafting sandwiches that grant various "Meal Powers" to the player. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that is readily available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during the Sandwich mini-game, Yogurt acts as a flavoring agent. It primarily boosts **Exp. Point Power**, **Catching Power**, and **Raid Power**. In the specific logic of Paldean Sandwich physics, it is categorized as a "Condiment."
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the Ingredients pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in standard VGC or Smogon formats. Its utility is strictly restricted to the **Paldean Overworld** for optimizing training (EXP) or encounter rates (Shiny Hunting/Catching).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. Its efficacy is determined by the specific Sandwich Recipe it is part of (e.g., used in several "Fruit Sandwich" variants).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Sold at various food-specific retail outlets across the **Paldea Region**, most notably at the **Artisan Bakery** and **Aquiesta Supermarket** chains. It is typically unlocked for purchase after obtaining a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon; it is an industrially produced food item intended for human and Pokémon consumption during Picnics. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
