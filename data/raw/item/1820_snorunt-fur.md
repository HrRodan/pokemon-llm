## Identity & Utility
**Snorunt Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A snippet of fur shed by a Snorunt. It is a specialized crafting component used primarily at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. It is classified as a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but is best saved for move creation.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" moves that the Snorunt evolutionary line typically masters.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle; has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be held or used during a match. Its value is strictly related to the "Technical Machine" progression system in the Paldea region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution directly, it is a byproduct of the Snorunt line (Snorunt, Glalie, and Froslass). It is not affected by abilities like Klutz as it is not a held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching members of the Snorunt evolutionary line in the wild. It is commonly found in snowy or icy biomes, such as **Glaseado Mountain** in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is a **guaranteed drop** upon a successful encounter with wild **Snorunt**, **Glalie**, or **Froslass**. It can also occasionally be found as a sparkling pickup in snowy terrain.
