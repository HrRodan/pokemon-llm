## Identity & Utility
**Lone-earring** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** Described as a single earring dropped by an unknown person. It is a **Consumable/Exchangeable** loot item that cannot be bought from standard Marts but is intended to be found and liquidated.
* **Cost:** 600 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Vendor Fodder**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves no functional purpose in battle or Pokémon development. Its sole primary utility is its **Economic Value**; it is meant to be sold to Poké Mart clerks to generate funds for the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is classified as "vendor trash" and has no viability in VGC, Smogon, or standard competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution, nor does it interact with specific abilities like Pickup in a way that provides unique benefits over other loot.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found as a hidden item or "trash" item in urban environments or populated areas within the Kanto region of the *Let's Go* series. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike items like Nuggets or Stardust, this specific item is rarer and tied primarily to overworld exploration rather than farming wild encounters.
* **Lore Context:** It represents the "Lost and Found" category of items, emphasizing the lived-in nature of the game world where NPCs lose personal belongings that the player character can scavenge.
