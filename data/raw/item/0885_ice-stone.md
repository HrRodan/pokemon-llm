## Identity & Utility
**Ice Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone characterized by an unmistakable snowflake pattern. It acts as a consumable catalyst to trigger evolution in specific species of Pokémon. Unlike standard hold items, it is used directly from the bag on a party member.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (Standard/Mid-range for elemental stones).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a compatible Pokémon, it triggers an immediate evolution. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the stone itself has no utility in competitive battles, it is essential for obtaining high-tier competitive Pokémon. Specifically, it is the only way to obtain **Alolan Ninetales** (a premier Aurora Veil setter in VGC and Smogon) and **Galarian Darmanitan** (a top-tier physical sweeper).
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Primary Evolutions (Alola):** Evolves **Alolan Sandshrew** into Alolan Sandslash and **Alolan Vulpix** into Alolan Ninetales.
    * **Extended Evolutions (World Knowledge):** Evolves **Galarian Darumaka** into Galarian Darmanitan (Gen VIII), **Eevee** into Glaceon (Gen VIII+, replacing the Icy Rock mechanic), and **Cetoddle** into Cetitan (Gen IX).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Alola), it is found at Po Town or via the Poké Pelago (Isle Aphun). In subsequent generations (Galar and Paldea), it can be purchased at specialized shops like Delibird Presents or found in snowy environments such as the Glaseado Mountain.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not currently known to be held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is limited to fixed overworld spawns, shop purchases, or rewards from the **Pickup** ability at high levels (starting in Gen VIII).
