## Identity & Utility
**TR90 (Play Rough)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A single-use data disc that teaches the move **Play Rough** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Sword and Shield, TRs are **consumable** and break after a single application. It is a high-value teaching tool used to provide physical Fairy-type coverage.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) at Watt Traders in the Wild Area rather than purchased with standard currency at most Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Play Rough**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Physical Fairy-type attack with 90 Power and 90% Accuracy. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Attack stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (Significant damage when used with the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier / Essential.** Play Rough is the gold standard for Physical Fairy-type offense. It is a staple on Pokémon like **Azumarill**, **Mimikyu**, and **Zacian**, as it provides the necessary power to threaten Dragon, Fighting, and Dark-type opponents. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of physical attackers, particularly those with high Attack stats that lack natural Fairy-type progression.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the Galar region. It is most commonly acquired by defeating **Fairy-type Pokémon in Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–8,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial data storage device manufactured for Galar's unique training environment. Collectors and competitive trainers often "farm" Max Raid dens to stock up on multiple copies due to its one-time use nature.
