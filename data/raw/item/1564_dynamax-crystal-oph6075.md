## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (OPH6075)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax encounter until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal cost, it is not sold at standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to initiate a **Max Raid Battle**. This allows the player to encounter a specific Pokémon (associated with the code OPH6075) regardless of the standard den rotation or weather conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for collection and team building. It allows players to farm specific Pokémon, potentially with Hidden Abilities or high IVs, which can then be trained for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used to facilitate a Wild Area encounter. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals are tied to specific, often event-exclusive, Pokémon species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Special Events** or **Promotional Serial Codes** (e.g., pre-order bonuses, retail distributions like GameStop or Micromania). Once the code is redeemed and the item is used, the encounter remains active only until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an out-of-battle event trigger.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals are concentrated masses of Galar particles that react with Power Spots to force a Dynamax projection, providing a reliable way to locate specific powerful Pokémon that are otherwise rare or elusive.
