## Identity & Utility
**Baguette** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** It serves as the fundamental structural base for the Picnic/Sandwich-making mechanic in the Paldea region. Unlike standard fillings, it is the mandatory vessel (bread) used to contain various ingredients to trigger Meal Powers. It is a **Consumable/Crafting** item that is handled via the Picnic interface.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the game's economy, the Baguette is a fixed component of the Sandwich-making UI rather than an individual item purchased in bulk from shops like "Sure Cans" or "Auden Side."

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as the "Bread" component in the Sandwich-making mini-game. Players must place fillings and condiments on the bottom half of the baguette and successfully place the top half (optional for mechanics, but required for the "complete" sandwich) to finalize the meal.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in direct combat. However, it is essential for **Meta-game Utility**, as it is the base for sandwiches that grant *Egg Power* (for breeding), *Sparkling Power* (for Shiny hunting), and *Encounter Power* (for targeted training).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic Mechanic**, where the physics of the baguette determine if ingredients stay on the sandwich or fall off, potentially altering the final Meal Power levels.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically provided whenever a player initiates the Sandwich-making process at a **Picnic**. While players must buy the fillings (like Ham, Lettuce, or Herba Mystica), the Baguette is the default substrate provided by the Picnic Kit.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a culinary item specific to human trainers in the Paldea region, used to bond with their team and influence the local environment through Meal Powers.
