## Identity & Utility
**Nosepass Fragment** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by Nosepass or its evolution. It is a consumable crafting resource used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. It is a common material that can be sold for a small amount of currency but is primarily used for move-teaching utility.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is used to craft TMs such as **TM093 (Pounce)** and **TM104 (Iron Defense)**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. As a TM Material, it has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it is derived from Nosepass, it does not trigger the evolution of Nosepass into Probopass (which requires a Thunder Stone or a special magnetic field depending on the game). It does not interact with abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found throughout the Paldea region or Kitakami wherever Nosepass and Probopass congregate. These materials are automatically added to the inventory upon defeating or catching the corresponding Pokémon.
* **Wild Drop:** Dropped by wild **Nosepass** and **Probopass**. In Scarlet and Violet, these drops are guaranteed upon a successful encounter, making them easily farmable in rocky or mountainous biomes.
