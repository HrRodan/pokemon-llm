## Identity & Utility
**TM02** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** categorized under **All-Machines**, fundamentally introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn) in its current data structure.
* **Description:** A data-encoding disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move that it might not learn through leveling up. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game generation) that **can be bought** in various Department Stores or specialized TM shops.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Claw** to a compatible Pokémon (notably in Generations III–VII and IX).
    * *Generational Variation:* In Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), TM02 teaches **Pay Day**. In Gen II, it was Headbutt, and in Gen I, it was Razor Wind. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Dragon Claw** is a competitive staple for Physical Dragon-type attackers. It is valued for its 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy without the negative side effects or locking mechanisms of moves like *Outrage* or *Draco Meteor*. It is a go-to STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for Pokémon like Garchomp, Dragonite, and Salamence in both VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in mid-to-late game locations. In the Hoenn region (Gen III), it is found deep within **Meteor Falls**. In many titles, it can be purchased at the **Celadon or Lilycove Department Stores** or crafted using the TM Machine in Paldea (Gen IX).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found held by wild Pokémon. It must be found as a "Poké Ball" item on the ground (overworld) or purchased from specific NPCs.
* **Lore Context:** TM02 represents the "standard" for physical Dragon-type offense. While the move contained within has shifted across the earliest generations, it has solidified its identity as the "Dragon Claw" machine for the majority of the franchise's history.
