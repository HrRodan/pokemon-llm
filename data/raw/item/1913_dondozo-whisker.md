## Identity & Utility
**Dondozo Whisker** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting component shed or collected from the Big Catfish Pokémon, Dondozo. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. While it has a sell value, its primary utility is as a resource for move-set customization.
* **Cost:** 160 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; often traded for League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a recipe requirement for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, this material is notably used to craft high-power moves, including:
    * **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**
    * **TM154 (Hydro Pump)**
    * **TM149 (Earthquake)** (Wait: Dondozo Whiskers are specifically required for Heavy Slam and Hydro Pump; Earthquake requires Phanpy Nails and Barboach Slime).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the item itself has no tactical value in a match, it is a mandatory resource for "building" competitive sets. Without farming these, players cannot access vital STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) or coverage moves for their team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any known evolutions. It is purely a currency-adjacent resource for the Gen IX crafting economy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Dondozo**. It can also be found as a sparkling item on the ground in habitats where Dondozo reside.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item; it is a **drop-on-defeat** resource. It is most efficiently farmed in the **Casseroya Lake** region of Paldea, where Dondozo appear as common, large-scale encounters. Because Dondozo is a high-HP "tank" Pokémon, farming these whiskers usually requires a strong Electric or Grass-type attacker to expedite the process.
