## Identity & Utility
**Dowsing Machine** (also known as the **Itemfinder** in certain regions) is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A high-tech exploration tool used to detect invisible objects buried or hidden in the environment. It emits signals—ranging from sound pings to visual radar displays depending on the model—to alert the Trainer to nearby loot. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated in the overworld, the device scans the immediate vicinity for hidden items. If an item is detected, it directs the player toward the location; if nothing is nearby, the search fails.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a pure utility item for the single-player campaign and resource gathering.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. However, it is the primary method for finding rare "one-off" items like **Leftovers**, **PP Up**, and various **evolutionary stones** or **Rare Candies** hidden by developers in the overworld map.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift from a **Professor’s Assistant** or a specific NPC early-to-mid game to encourage exploration. In Generation III (its origin), it was given to the player in Slateport City (R/S/E) or by an aide on Route 11 (FR/LG).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. While the **Pickup** ability generates new items out of thin air, the **Dowsing Machine** is required to find static hidden items pre-placed in the game world. It is a staple tool for "completionist" runs and Nuzlockes to maximize available resources.
