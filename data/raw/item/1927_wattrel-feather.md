## Identity & Utility
**Wattrel Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Wattrel evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. While it cannot be used directly in battle, it serves as a fundamental resource for move-pool expansion in the Paldea region.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap; primarily sold for 60 League Points (LP) or used as a reagent).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient in the crafting recipes for specific TMs at Pokémon Centers. Based on the Pokémon it originates from, it is typically required for Flying-type or Speed-based moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** Null (Cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Competitive.** This item provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages during a match. Its utility is strictly limited to the "Teambuilding" phase, allowing players to access powerful moves like **Aerial Ace**, **Agility**, or **Hurricane** (depending on the specific game recipes).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is categorized strictly as a crafting byproduct of the Wattrel line.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Wattrel** or **Kilowattrel**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; it is rewarded directly to the player's inventory upon the conclusion of a battle with the corresponding Pokémon. It is most efficiently gathered by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in coastal or cliffside biomes where Wattrel are abundant.
* **Lore context:** The feather is light and imbued with the energy of the sea breezes and electricity that Wattrel harness while nesting on seaside cliffs.
