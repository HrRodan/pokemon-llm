## Identity & Utility
**Basement Key (New Mauville)** is a **Key Item** categorized as "unused" within the Generation VII (Alola) internal data, though it originates from the Hoenn region.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized key used to gain access to New Mauville, a subterranean power plant facility located beneath Mauville City. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is tied strictly to progression and exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its native region (Hoenn), the key is used to open the locked gate leading into the New Mauville facility. This allows the player to access a generator room to resolve a mechanical crisis or encounter rare Electric-type Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it is restricted to overworld quest progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the overworld environment to trigger the "New Mauville" sidequest.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally gifted to the player by **Wattson**, the Gym Leader of Mauville City, after the player has fulfilled certain requirements (such as defeating the local Gym or dealing with regional threats). In the context of the Generation VII data provided, it exists as a legacy or placeholder item and is not obtainable through normal Alolan gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon.
* **Lore context:** New Mauville was an ambitious project intended to create an underground city but was ultimately abandoned and converted into a power plant. The facility is a hotspot for Electric-type Pokémon like **Magnemite**, **Voltorb**, and in some versions, the legendary **Raikou** (via Mirage Spots). The key represents the player's clearance to enter this hazardous area.
