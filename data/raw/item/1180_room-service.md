## Identity & Utility
**Room Service** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that interacts specifically with field conditions. It is a consumable held item that triggers once per battle, designed to manipulate turn order. 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate cost; usually acquired via Battle Points (BP) or specialized shops in later generations).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the move **Trick Room** is successfully used while the holder is on the field, the Room Service is consumed, and the holder's **Speed is lowered by one stage**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling, though it loses its primary Speed-dropping utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **niche competitive staple**, primarily used in Double Battles (VGC). Its purpose is to ensure a Pokémon becomes as slow as possible once Trick Room is active, allowing it to "outspeed" (move before) opponents who are also naturally slow or those also operating under Trick Room (like Torkoal or Amoonguss).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon use. It does not trigger if Trick Room is already active when the Pokémon switches in; it only triggers at the moment the move is successfully executed. It has no effect on evolution and is hindered by the **Klutz** ability or the move **Embargo**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sword & Shield), it is typically purchased from the **Battle Tower** for BP. In Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet), it can be purchased at **Delibird Presents** locations after progressing through the gym challenge.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a specialized tactical tool developed for high-level trainers rather than a naturally occurring object. It is often used by trainers running "Hard Trick Room" teams to guarantee priority within the distorted dimensions of the move.
