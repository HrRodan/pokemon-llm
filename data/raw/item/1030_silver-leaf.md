## Identity & Utility
**Silver Leaf** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A mysterious, metallic leaf from an unidentified tree species. It is a **Consumable Loot** item that serves no functional purpose in battle or training; its primary value lies in its high resale price. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Value**). While it can be sold for a decent sum, it is generally found rather than purchased from standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Silver Leaf has no direct usage effect on a Pokémon's stats, health, or evolution. It is strictly a "treasure" item, similar to a Pearl or a Stardust, intended to be sold to shops to fund the trainer's journey.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a dead item in competitive play (Smogon/VGC) as it provides no held-item bonus and occupies a valuable slot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions and has no unique interactions with abilities like Pickup (though it is often a reward from similar "searching" mechanics).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Kanto region (Generation VII remakes), this item is typically discovered as a **hidden item** in the overworld. It is frequently found by observing the player's partner Pokémon (Pikachu or Eevee), who may locate it in bushes or landmarks.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not associated with any wild Pokémon held-item tables. It is primarily sourced through overworld exploration and "hidden object" mechanics.
* **Lore Context:** The flavor text highlights its mystery ("No trees with this leaf have been found yet"), suggesting it may have fallen from a rare or perhaps supernatural source, though this has not been expanded upon in subsequent generations.
