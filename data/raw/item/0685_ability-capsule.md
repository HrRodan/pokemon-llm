## Identity & Utility
**Ability Capsule** is a **Vitamin** (Training Utility) introduced in **Generation VI**.
* **Description:** A specialized capsule designed for Pokémon that possess two possible standard biological abilities. It allows a Trainer to manually toggle between these two traits. It is a **Consumable** item that is **Not for sale** in standard Poké Marts, typically requiring specialized currency or endgame access. 
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium Acquisition**; often localized to Battle Point shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon in the overworld, it switches the Pokémon's current Ability to its other standard Ability. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item is consumed upon use in the overworld and is not intended for battle-hold mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Team Building Staple.** While it has no effect *during* a battle, it is indispensable for competitive players (VGC/Smogon) to optimize a Pokémon's kit, especially for Shiny Pokémon or Legendaries that were caught with a sub-optimal standard ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Strict Limitation:** It **cannot** be used to change a Pokémon to its Hidden Ability (HA), nor can it change a Pokémon with its Hidden Ability to a standard one. 
    * **Hierarchy:** It serves as the "Standard Tier" ability modifier, superseded by the **Ability Patch** (which handles Hidden Abilities). It has no effect on Pokémon with only one possible standard ability (e.g., Mewtwo's Pressure).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally available only through post-game **Battle Facilities** (such as the Battle Maison in Kalos/Hoenn or the Battle Tree in Alola) in exchange for BP (Battle Points). In more recent regions like Paldea, it can be purchased at high-end **Delibird Presents** locations for a high credit or LP cost.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or common held items, this is a manufactured medical tool that cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**; it must be earned through rigorous training or significant financial investment.
