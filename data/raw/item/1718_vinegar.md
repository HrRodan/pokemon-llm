## Identity & Utility
**Vinegar** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A sharp, acidic condiment used exclusively in the Picnic mechanic to craft Sandwiches. It serves as a seasoning component rather than a physical filling. As a specialized culinary item, it is a consumable used to manipulate Meal Powers but has no utility in standard turn-based combat.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich recipe, Vinegar contributes primarily to the **Sour** and **Sweet** flavor profiles. It is essential for balancing specific "Meal Powers," which provide various buffs such as increased Shiny encounter rates (Sparkling Power), improved catch rates (Catching Power), or increased experience (Exp. Point Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Vinegar cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the "Picnic" out-of-battle mechanic. It provides no statistical or tactical advantages during a Pokémon battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Vinegar does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. It is strictly a crafting component for the Paldean sandwich system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in the Paldea region. It can be purchased from dedicated grocery retailers, most notably **Aquiesta Supermarket** and **Deli Cioso** outlets. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. Unlike berries or held items, it must be purchased from vendors or occasionally obtained as a reward from high-tier Tera Raid Battles (though primary acquisition remains via NPC shops). It is not obtainable via the **Pickup** ability.
