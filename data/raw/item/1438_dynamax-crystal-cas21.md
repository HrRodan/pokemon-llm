## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CAS21)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It is a consumable event trigger that activates a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal price; technically not for sale via standard Poke Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the player can consume this crystal to immediately trigger a Max Raid Battle. The beam produced is red/purple and persists until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is purely administrative—allowing players to encounter specific Pokémon (often Gigantamax forms or rare event-exclusive species) that may have competitive value once caught.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the Watchtower Lair node in the Galar region's Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific variant (CAS21) was typically distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional tie-ins (such as those for the *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Rescue Team DX* launch or specific retail distributions like GameStop or Micromania). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is an "Event Item" that exists outside the standard gameplay loop of scavenging or shopping.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent a way for developers to offer "on-demand" Raid encounters, bypassing the RNG of standard Wishing Pieces and Den resets.
