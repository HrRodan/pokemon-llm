## Identity & Utility
**Strange Ball** is an **Event-Item / Specialized Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* and *Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl*).
* **Description:** A specialized, teal-colored Poké Ball designed to bridge compatibility gaps between different Pokémon eras and regions. It is a **Special Acquisition** item that **cannot** be bought or sold in any standard Poké Mart. It serves as a visual placeholder for Pokémon caught in balls that do not exist within the internal data of the game they have been transferred to.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Strange Ball acts as a "fallback" container. When a Pokémon is transferred via **Pokémon HOME** from *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* to a modern title like *Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl* or *Scarlet/Violet*, it appears in a Strange Ball because its original Hisuian ball (e.g., Feather Ball, Leaden Ball, Origin Ball) does not exist in those games' code. Conversely, Pokémon transferred from modern games into *Legends: Arceus* also appear in this ball.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Purely Aesthetic.** It functions as a "Cherish Ball-adjacent" status symbol, signaling that the Pokémon originated from a different time period or a specific cross-title transfer. It provides no competitive stat boosts or gameplay advantages.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolutions. It is strictly a container for the Pokémon and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is never found in the overworld or purchased. It is automatically assigned to a Pokémon by the **Pokémon HOME** transfer system. It is the only way to represent Hisuian-captured Pokémon in the Sinnoh or Paldea regions without causing data corruption.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is essentially "spawned" by the inter-dimensional transfer process within the Pokémon storage ecosystem.
* **Lore Context:** The ball's primitive yet mysterious design reflects the "strange" nature of space-time distortions seen in the Hisui region. It represents a bridge between the ancient past and the modern Pokémon world.
