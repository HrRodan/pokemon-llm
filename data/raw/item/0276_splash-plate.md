## Identity & Utility
**Splash Plate** is a **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with a mysterious blessing. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that provides a passive power boost to Water-type techniques. While it has a listed cost, it is typically treated as a rare artifact rather than a standard consumable.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though generally acquired through exploration rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of its **Water-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Special Mechanic (Multitype):** If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (Arceus), the holder’s primary type changes to **Water**. Additionally, the move **Judgment** becomes Water-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a mandatory item for **Arceus-Water** sets in Uber tiers, providing both the necessary type change and a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) boost. For non-Arceus Pokémon, it is generally niche, often outclassed by *Mystic Water* (which has the same effect but is easier to obtain) or higher-impact items like *Life Orb* or *Choice Specs*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is not an evolution item, but it is immune to being removed or stolen via *Knock Off* or *Thief* when held by a Pokémon with the Multitype ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found in the **Sinnoh Underground** (as indicated by its `underground` attribute) or hidden in aquatic locations across various regions (e.g., Route 219 in Sinnoh or the Abyssal Ruins in Unova). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**; it must be found as a fixed floor item or via specialized mechanics like the Sinnoh Underground mining minigame.
* **Lore context:** One of the many plates said to be fragments of the original creator Pokémon’s power, each representing a different elemental force.
