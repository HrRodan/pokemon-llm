## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CRU4853)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used specifically in the Galar region's Wild Area. When brought to the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is categorized as a consumable utility item and is not intended for standard shop distribution.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the internal data lists a cost of 20, this item is functionally "Not for Sale" and is traditionally acquired through serial codes or special retail promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the player can use this crystal to activate a Max Raid Battle. This causes a specific Pokémon—typically a rare encounter or one with exclusive attributes—to appear as a Raid Boss.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression/collection item. It does not provide any statistical benefit or tactical advantage in Trainer battles. Its primary value is allowing the player to encounter and catch a Pokémon that may possess its Hidden Ability (HA) or unique Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a single-use trigger for the Max Raid mechanic; once the raid is initiated, the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are not available in standard Poké Marts or via the Watt Traders. They were historically distributed via **promotional serial codes** (e.g., as bonuses for purchasing the Sword & Shield Dual Pack or through localized retail events).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is considered a special distribution item that exists outside the standard gameplay loop of farming or the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents a concentrated form of Galar's Power Spot energy, localized into a specific frequency to attract a designated Pokémon species to the otherwise dormant Watchtower Lair.
