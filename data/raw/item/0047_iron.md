## Identity & Utility
**Iron** is a **Vitamin** (Consumable Medicine) that has been a staple of Pokémon training since Generation I (though indexed here with Generation IV metadata).
* **Description:** A nutritious, mineral-rich drink designed for Pokémon consumption. It is a consumable supplement used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's physical durability. It can be used both in the overworld and during battle (though battle use is typically restricted to friendship boosting or specific niche scenarios).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium investment**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, Iron increases a Pokémon’s **Defense Effort Values (EVs)** by 10. 
    * *Historical Note:* In older generations (I-VII), it could not be used if the Pokémon already had 100 or more Defense EVs. 
    * *Modern Context:* From Generation VIII onwards, this cap was removed, allowing Iron to be used until the Pokémon reaches the maximum 252 Defense EV limit.
* **Secondary Mechanics:**
    * **Friendship/Happiness:** Increases a Pokémon's happiness by 5, 3, or 2 points depending on the current happiness tier.
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary status effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** Essential for **EV Training**. It is used by competitive players to quickly "stat out" defensive walls (e.g., Ferrothorn, Toxapex) without the need for grinding against wild Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution directly, the happiness boost can contribute to the requirements for Pokémon that evolve via high friendship (e.g., Eevee into Umbreon/Espeon).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at high-end locations such as **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove, Veilstone) and the Pokémon League. In modern games, it is often available for purchase using BP (Battle Points) or at specialized Chansey Supply shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial supplement. It is frequently gathered by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at higher levels (typically Level 31+ depending on the game version).
* **World Context:** Iron represents one of the six core "Vitamins" (alongside Protein, Calcium, Zinc, Carbos, and HP Up) used by trainers to optimize their team's performance beyond natural leveling.
