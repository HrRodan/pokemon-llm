## Identity & Utility
**Sachet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A small bag filled with potent, slightly overwhelming fragrant perfumes. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is consumed immediately upon the completion of a successful trade. While it can be bought, it serves a highly specific purpose rather than general utility.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Spritzee** during a trade, it triggers the evolution into **Aromatisse**. The item is consumed and disappears after the evolution process is complete.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High). Despite being a small perfume bag, it deals significant physical damage when used with the move Fling, though it provides no secondary Fling effect.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Non-existent. It is a "one-and-done" evolution tool. It provides no passive benefits in a competitive battle environment; its only value is in the preparation phase to obtain Aromatisse (a notable Trick Room setter in lower tiers or VGC).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically tied to the **Spritzee** evolutionary line. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup in the provided data and is not a baby trigger.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialty shops or traded for Battle Points (BP) in various regions. In its debut region (Kalos), it is obtainable via the Battle Maison or found as a field item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly found on wild Pokémon according to current data. It is primarily acquired through overworld exploration or specialized currency exchanges.
* **Lore context:** The flavor text suggests the scent is "too overwhelming" for humans, yet it is specifically calibrated to appeal to the refined olfactory senses of the Spritzee line, which is known for its association with scents and perfumes.
