## Identity & Utility
**Poffin Case** is a **Key Item** (Gameplay category) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** A specialized storage container designed to hold Poffins—confections cooked from Berries to improve a Pokémon's Contest conditions. It is a permanent Key Item that cannot be consumed, sold, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story progression or specific NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Poffin Case acts as a dedicated inventory sub-menu, capable of containing up to **100 Poffins**. These Poffins are used to increase a Pokémon’s Beauty, Coolness, Cuteness, Smartness, and Toughness stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly utilized for the **Pokémon Super Contest** mechanic and has no impact on standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the case itself has no direct combat utility, it is essential for the evolution of **Feebas**. By storing and allowing the feeding of Poffins that increase the **Beauty** stat, the Poffin Case facilitates Feebas's evolution into **Milotic** once its Beauty condition is sufficiently high.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Sinnoh region (*Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum* and *Brilliant Diamond, Shining Pearl*), the Poffin Case is obtained from the **Pokémon Fan Club Chairman** in **Hearthome City**. Possession of the case is a prerequisite for using the Poffin House's mixers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, as it is a unique story-related item.
