## Identity & Utility
**TM140 (Nasty Plot)** is an **All-Machines** category item introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Nasty Plot**. In the context of the Paldea region and the Blueberry Academy, TMs are single-use items that can be crafted at a TM Machine once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration or by crafting using **5,000 League Points (LP)** and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Nasty Plot** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Effect:** The user stimulates its brain by thinking bad thoughts, sharply raising its **Special Attack** stat by **two stages (+2)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Nasty Plot is one of the most powerful setup moves in competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). It allows special attackers like **Gholdengo**, **Hydreigon**, and **Mewscarada** to double their offensive pressure in a single turn, making them capable of sweeping entire teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.
