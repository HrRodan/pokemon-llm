## Identity & Utility
**Muscle-mochi** is a Vitamin introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero* DLC).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable treat from the Kitakami region that enhances a Pokémon's physical prowess. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that serves as a regional alternative to the traditional "Protein" item. It can be bought/sold for a nominal price but is primarily earned through activity.
* **Cost:** 125 Poké Dollars (Inexpensive; however, its value is higher in effort than in currency as it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases a Pokémon’s **Attack Effort Values (EVs) by 10 points**. Like other Gen IX vitamins, it can be used until the Pokémon reaches the maximum cap of 252 Attack EVs or the global cap of 510 total EVs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item is primarily used in the overworld menu and cannot be effectively used in a tactical Fling capacity).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** It is a staple for competitive players and "shiny hunters" to quickly prepare physical sweepers for VGC or Smogon formats without the need for repetitive wild Pokémon grinding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It belongs to the "Mochi" family of items, which includes specialized mochis for every stat and the "Fresh-Start Mochi," which resets all EVs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for participating in the **Ogre Oustin'** mini-game in Mossui Town (Kitakami). It can also be acquired via the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy's League Club Room or as a random reward from auctions and certain NPCs in the Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, this is an artisanal food item crafted within the lore of the Kitakami region, often gathered via the **Pickup** ability only in specific regional contexts or through specialized mini-game rewards.
