## Identity & Utility
**TR85 (Work Up)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use teaching device that instructs a compatible Pokémon on the move **Work Up**. In Generation VIII, TRs (Technical Records) are distinct from TMs (Technical Machines) because they break after one use, mirroring the mechanics of early-generation TMs. 
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Note: In its home region of Galar, it is primarily traded for Watts rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Work Up**, a status move that increases both the user's **Attack** and **Special Attack** stats by one stage each (+1 Atk, +1 Sp. Atk).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Situational.** Work Up is specifically valued by "Mixed Attackers"—Pokémon that utilize both physical and special moves in a single set (e.g., Lucario or Drampa). In most competitive scenarios (Smogon or VGC), it is often passed over for more specialized boosting moves like *Swords Dance* (+2 Attack) or *Nasty Plot* (+2 Sp. Atk) unless the Pokémon lacks access to them.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly a teaching tool and does not trigger evolution or interact with abilities like *Pickup*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR85 is primarily acquired by defeating Dynamax Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** found throughout the Wild Area. Its availability rotates daily among traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike TMs, TRs are treated as high-value rewards for Raid participation, reflecting the "record" of a powerful move rather than a standard piece of hardware.
