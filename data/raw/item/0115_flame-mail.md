## Identity & Utility
**Flame-mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation II** (and featured prominently in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a blazing red flame print. It is a **Consumable/Social** item used to send personalized messages to other players during Pokémon trades. While it is technically "held" by a Pokémon, it serves as a communication tool rather than a traditional stat-boosting item.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer can compose a short message using a predetermined list of words and phrases. When given to a Pokémon, the item is "held," and the message travels with the Pokémon during a trade. Once the recipient reads the message, they can choose to erase it (making the Flame-mail reusable) or store the message in their PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Anti-Thief Utility:** In older competitive generations (Gens II–V), Mail possessed a unique defensive mechanic: a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot have its item removed or swapped** by moves like *Trick*, *Switcheroo*, *Thief*, or *Covet*. 
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically a **Niche Tech** choice in early competitive formats to block item-stealing strategies, though it offers no offensive or defensive stat benefits and prevents the Pokémon from being deposited into the PC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Flame-mail cannot be placed into the PC Storage System; the Mail must be removed first.
    * **Modern Status:** As of Generation VI, Mail (including Flame-mail) has been largely retired from the core series games and cannot be transferred forward from the handheld era to modern Switch titles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in various regions (notably Sinnoh and Johto). Due to its low price, it was often used by NPCs to exchange tips or flavor text.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon; it is primarily a player-purchased commodity for social interaction and trade-based communication.
