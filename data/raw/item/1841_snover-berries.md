## Identity & Utility
**Snover Berries** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** Despite the name, these are not edible Berries used for healing or status cures. They are biological materials shed by the Snover evolutionary line, categorized as crafting components. They are **Consumable** only in the context of the TM Machine and **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common crafting material; primarily used for League Point (LP) exchange or crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient at the **TM Machine** located at Pokémon Centers. These materials are combined with League Points (LP) to create Technical Machines (TMs) to teach moves to Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in active battle. Its value is strictly for team preparation, allowing players to craft essential moves for competitive builds.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Material" item, a mechanic specific to the Paldea region's crafting system. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Harvest in the traditional sense.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild Pokémon in the Snover family. They are not sold in stores but can be exchanged for LP at a 1:1 ratio based on their cost.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the classic sense (it doesn't appear in the held item slot), it is dropped as loot upon defeating or catching wild **Snover** and **Abomasnow**. These are most commonly farmed in snowy regions such as **Glaseado Mountain**.
