## Identity & Utility
**Smiling Vee Pick** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative, consumable food pick used during the Sandwich-making process at Picnics. It features a charming design inspired by the "Vee" (Eevee) motif. It is a **Consumable** tool that can be bought at specialized culinary shops.
* **Cost:** 1200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the final component in the Sandwich-making mini-game. Once the ingredients are stacked, the trainer must place the Smiling Vee Pick to "finish" the sandwich. While the pick does not influence the specific levels of **Meal Powers** (such as Sparkling Power or Encounter Power), it is a required item to complete the assembly.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a quality-of-life and cosmetic item for the overworld Picnic mechanic. It has no impact on Smogon or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. Its sole interaction is within the sandwich UI to secure ingredients.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased primarily at **Every Wich Way** specialty stores found in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia**. It becomes available early in the player's journey.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore Context:** The "Vee" branding is a popular aesthetic choice in the Paldea region, celebrating the Eevee line. Trainers use these picks to personalize their picnic experience, reflecting a culture that values both culinary utility and Pokémon-themed flair.
