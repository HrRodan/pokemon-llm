## Identity & Utility
**TM44 (Rest)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation I** (though this data entry originates from its Generation III Hoenn iteration).
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide a Pokémon with the move **Rest**. It is a reusable or consumable utility item (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that is almost always obtainable through exploration or high-end shops.
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Expensive**). This price point typically reflects its status as a high-tier, infinite-use machine in specific generations or a premium late-game purchase.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Rest** to a compatible Pokémon. When used in battle, the Pokémon falls asleep for two turns to fully restore its HP and cure any non-volatile status conditions (Poison, Burn, Paralysis, etc.).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Rest is the foundation of the "Rest-Talk" strategy (Rest + Sleep Talk), allowing defensive walls and tanks to survive prolonged matches. It is vital for Pokémon that lack reliable recovery moves like Recover or Slack Off.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it has high synergy with the **Chesto Berry** (for an immediate wake-up) and abilities such as **Early Bird** (reduced sleep duration), **Hydration** (instant cure in rain), or **Guts** (Attack boost while sleeping).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, TM44 is often found in the **S.S. Anne** (Gen I), **Ice Path** (Gen II), or provided by an NPC in **Lilycove City** (Gen III). In modern titles, it is frequently available in Department Stores or via the TM Machine crafting system.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a man-made device for move tutoring.
* **Historical Significance:** As one of the few moves that has remained "TM44" across almost every single generation (from Red/Blue to Scarlet/Violet), it is one of the most consistent and recognizable items in the franchise's inventory history.
