## Identity & Utility
**Salamencite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*), though the provided data highlights its integration in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized stone that reacts with a Mega Ring or Z-Power Ring. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that enables a specific transformation during battle. It is **not for sale** via traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In Gen VII, it is typically acquired through high-level battle facilities rather than purchased with currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Salamence, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** during its turn. This transformation significantly increases Salamence's base stats (notably Attack, Defense, and Speed) and replaces its ability with **Aerilate**, which converts Normal-type moves into Flying-type moves and increases their power.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Cannot be Flung if the user is a Salamence capable of Mega Evolving; generally protected from item-removal effects like Thief or Trick in most competitive formats).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/Top-Tier Staple.** Mega Salamence is widely considered one of the most powerful Mega Evolutions in the history of the franchise. It has seen heavy usage in VGC and was historically banned to the **Ubers** tier in Smogon competitive singles due to its immense bulk, high speed, and the destructive power of Aerilate-boosted moves like Return or Double-Edge.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution; it is a temporary, mid-battle transformation. It is specific only to Salamence and cannot be used by any other Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Hoenn/ORAS), it is gifted by Zinnia's grandmother in Meteor Falls after the Delta Episode. In the Generation VII Alola region (referenced in the JSON), it is obtained as a reward at the **Battle Tree** for 64 Battle Points (BP).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact associated with the lore of the Draconid people and the phenomenon of Mega Evolution.
