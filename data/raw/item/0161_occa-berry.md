## Identity & Utility
**Occa Berry** is a Type-protection Berry introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A held item that triggers automatically to mitigate elemental weaknesses. It belongs to the specialized family of "Resist Berries." It is a consumable held item that is technically purchasable but primarily sourced through cultivation or specific NPCs.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though typically acquired via foraging rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a super-effective Fire-type attack, the Berry is consumed to halve (50% reduction) the damage taken from that hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; consumption via Fling does not trigger the damage reduction effect).
    * **Natural Gift:** Under world mechanics (Gen IV-VI), this Berry transforms the move Natural Gift into a **Fire-type** attack with **80 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-utility niche item in competitive formats like VGC and Smogon. It is specifically used on Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Fire—such as **Scizor**, **Ferrothorn**, and **Kartana**—allowing them to survive an otherwise guaranteed OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) to retaliate or set up entry hazards.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles the damage reduction), **Unnerve** (prevents the opponent from eating it), and **Harvest** (allows the user to regenerate the Berry after use).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in Berry patches across Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos. In many regions, it is obtained from the Berry Master or specialized daily NPCs. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Mawile**, **Pansage**, and **Simisage**. Trainers often farm these using the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief** and **Covet** to bypass the low spawn rates of specific Berries.
