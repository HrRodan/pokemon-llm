## Identity & Utility
**Z-Power Ring** is a **Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** A mysterious, upgraded bracelet worn by the Trainer that enables Pokémon to tap into Z-Power. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It serves as the advanced successor to the standard Z-Ring, required to channel the willpower and physical energy of the Trainer into a Pokémon’s Z-Move.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a critical story-progression item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When in the Trainer's possession, it allows Pokémon holding a compatible **Z-Crystal** to perform a **Z-Move** once per battle. In *Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, it also enables the use of **Ultra Burst**, allowing Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings Necrozma to transform into Ultra Necrozma when holding Ultranecrozium Z.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential/Core Mechanic.** In the context of Generation VII competitive play (VGC 2018/2019 and Smogon Gen 7), this item is the mechanical gateway for Z-Moves, which defined the meta-game by providing high-damage, "nuke" options that bypass defensive checks like *Protect* (with reduced damage).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but acts as the trigger for **Ultra Burst** (Necrozma). It has no interaction with abilities like *Pickup* or *Klutz* as it remains in the Trainer's inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Received as a story-related gift. In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, it is given to the player by **Kahuna Hala** after completing the first trial or during the early stages of the Alolan island challenge, replacing the role of the standard Z-Ring.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is unique to the Trainer and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** The Z-Power Ring is said to be made from refined **Sparkling Stones** granted by the Island Guardians (Tapus). It represents the bond between Trainer and Pokémon, specifically designed to handle a wider array of Z-Crystals than the original Z-Ring.
