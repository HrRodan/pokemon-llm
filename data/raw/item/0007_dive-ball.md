## Identity & Utility
**Dive Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball designed with a thematic focus on aquatic environments. It is a **Consumable** item used in-battle to capture wild Pokémon. It is highly effective against species encountered in, on, or under the water.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for specialized capture devices).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to capture a wild Pokémon. It grants a **3.5× Catch Rate multiplier** if the encounter occurs while **Surfing**, **Fishing**, or (in specific regions like Hoenn or Unova) while **Underwater**. In any other encounter context, it functions as a standard Poké Ball with a **1× multiplier**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have no base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no combat stat benefits, the Dive Ball is a **top-tier aesthetic choice** in the competitive community. Trainers frequently use it to match the color palette of Water-type Pokémon (e.g., Kyogre, Suicune, or Azumarill) due to its distinct blue and teal wave pattern.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a capture mechanic and an aesthetic "container" for the Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at specialized Poké Marts or League Stalls (notably in **Mossdeep City** in Hoenn or the **Boutique** in later generations). In some games, it is found as a hidden item near coastal routes or given as a reward for fishing-related side quests.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike standard Poké Balls, it is rarely found via the **Pickup** ability, making it an item that must typically be purchased or found in overworld clusters.
* **Regional Context:** Originally designed for the Hoenn region to facilitate the unique "Dive" HM mechanic, it has since become a staple in every region with significant water bodies.
