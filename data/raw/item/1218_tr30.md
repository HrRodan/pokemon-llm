## Identity & Utility
**TR30 (Encore)** is a **Technical Record** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** TR30 is a single-use instructional device used to teach a Pokémon the move **Encore**. Unlike the infinite-use Technical Machines (TMs) of the same era, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, making them a consumable resource.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; though primarily traded for **Watts** at Watt Traders in the Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Encore** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Effect:** Encore compels the target to repeat its last used move for three consecutive turns. This is an elite disruption tool used to lock opponents into non-damaging status moves (like Stealth Rock or Protect) or weak attacks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; should not be used for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** In competitive formats (Smogon and VGC), Encore is a premier "anti-setup" move. It punishes players who attempt to use "Dragon Dance" or "Swords Dance" by forcing them to continue buffing while the user switches to a counter or attacks freely. It is also a primary counter to the move "Protect."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "support" and "prankster" Pokémon, such as Whimsicott, Clefable, and Togekiss.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR30 is primarily obtained by defeating Raid Bosses in **Max Raid Battles** (Normal, Fairy, or Water-type dens). It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a fluctuating price in Watts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a piece of Galar-specific technology and is typically farmed through the Max Raid mechanic rather than traditional foraging or the **Pickup** ability.
