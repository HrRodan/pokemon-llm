## Identity & Utility
**Sandile Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item represents a physical fragment dropped by members of the Sandile evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** that cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts; instead, it is collected through overworld encounters.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Material Value**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its exchange rate for League Points (LP) or its use as a crafting ingredient.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required at the **TM Machine** to craft Technical Machines. It has no direct usage on a Pokémon in or out of battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials typically cannot be used with Fling in a meaningful way, or have negligible power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression-based utility item used for team building and moveset customization rather than active combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for evolution. However, it is a mandatory component for crafting high-value TMs such as **TM062 (Foul Play)** and **TM149 (Earthquake)**, making it a high-priority farmable item for ground-type and physical attacker builds.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Sandile**, **Krokorok**, or **Krookodile**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a **guaranteed/random drop** upon the conclusion of a battle. In the Paldea region, these are most efficiently farmed in the **Asado Desert**, where the Sandile family is indigenous and plentiful.
* **Context:** The introduction of Sandile Claws reflects the "Material" economy of modern Pokémon titles, shifting away from infinite-use TMs back to a resource-management system where players must hunt specific species to "teach" moves.
