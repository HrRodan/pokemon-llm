## Identity & Utility
**Item Drop** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized tactical item exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** battle mechanic. It is a battle-only consumable that cannot be bought in standard shops or held by Pokémon. It is used to manipulate the held items of the user's own team members.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through the accumulation of points during Wonder Launcher battles).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during a battle, it forces another random friendly Pokémon on the field to drop its held item. This item removal lasts only for the duration of the battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held, and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Legacy Gimmick.** This item is restricted entirely to the "Wonder Launcher" format in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. It has no presence in standard competitive formats like VGC or Smogon, as it is tied to a mechanic that was discontinued after Generation V. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts strictly with the held item slot, potentially used to clear a negative item (like a choice-lock or a detrimental item received via *Switcheroo*) or to prepare a Pokémon for an ability like **Unburden**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Only available during multiplayer battles where the **Wonder Launcher** setting is enabled. Players "purchase" the item mid-battle using points earned turn-by-turn. It cannot be found in the overworld, Marts, or held by any Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a temporary digital tool used within the specific battle-simulating technology of the Unova region.
