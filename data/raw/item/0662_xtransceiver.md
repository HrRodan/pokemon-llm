## Effect & Mechanics

* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for story progression and multiplayer social features; it has no application in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Social Features:** In the original DS releases, it allowed up to four players to engage in voice and video chat via local wireless or the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (using the C-Gear).
    * **Side Quests:** In *Pokémon Black 2 and White 2*, the Xtransceiver is central to the "Dropped Item" side quest involving the characters Yancy or Curtis, requiring the player to answer calls at specific locations to build a relationship and eventually trade for rare Pokémon with Hidden Abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically obtained during the early stages of the Unova journey. In *Black and White*, it is gifted by the player's mother; in *Black 2 and White 2*, it is received from Bianca in Aspertia City.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore context:** The Xtransceiver represents the technological advancement of the Unova region compared to previous generations, mirroring the real-world rise of smartphones and video calling during the early 2010s. It serves as the Unovan equivalent of the Pokégear (Johto), PokéNav (Hoenn), or Pokétch (Sinnoh).
