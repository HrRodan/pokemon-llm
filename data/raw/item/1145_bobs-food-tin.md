## Identity & Utility
**Bob's Food Tin** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A culinary ingredient specifically used for cooking at Pokémon Camp. The flavor text notes that this tinned food, sold by a character named Bob, is "curiously popular" throughout the Galar region. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily used to complete the Curry Dex.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Pokémon Camp cooking mini-game, it serves as the key ingredient to create various tiers of **Tin Food Curry**. Depending on the quality of the cooking and additional berries used, it restores Pokémon HP, PP, and increases friendliness/experience points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Significant physical damage for a non-combat item, though it lacks secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be used during battle and provides no passive buffs when held. Its value is strictly limited to the "overworld" camping mechanic and Nuzlocke recovery.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of a version-exclusive pair; Bob's Food Tin is the signature ingredient of **Pokémon Sword**, while Bach's Food Tin is its counterpart in Pokémon Shield.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily in **Pokémon Sword**. It is sold by Ingredients Sellers located in the Wild Area (specifically at the Rolling Fields or Hammerlocke Hills) and by the merchant in Wedgehurst.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In *Pokémon Shield*, players can only obtain this item through trading or by joining a Pokémon Camp hosted by a *Sword* player, making it a "version-locked" collectible for completionists.
