## Identity & Utility
**Mystery Egg** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in Generation II and updated in Generation IV (HeartGold/SoulSilver).
* **Description:** A mysterious Egg obtained from Mr. Pokémon during the initial stages of the Johto journey. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be used in battle, given to a Pokémon to hold, or consumed. Its primary purpose is to be delivered to Professor Elm for research.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the primary catalyst for the early-game narrative. Obtaining this item triggers several critical flags:
    * The break-in at Professor Elm’s lab by the Rival (Silver).
    * The first Rival battle.
    * Access to Johto Route 31.
    * The eventual reception of the Pokédex from Professor Oak (who is visiting Mr. Pokémon).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for story progression and remains in the Key Items pocket until removed by an NPC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the item itself is a plot device delivered to Professor Elm, it is the precursor to the **Egg** given back to the player by Elm’s assistant in Violet City, which hatches into **Togepi**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a mandatory story event from **Mr. Pokémon** at his house on Route 30. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore context:** The Mystery Egg represents the first scientific discovery of Pokémon Eggs in the Johto region. Professor Elm’s fascination with this specific specimen drives the player's initial errand, setting the entire Johto adventure in motion. In the remakes (HGSS), it is classified under Generation IV data but remains exclusive to the Johto-based plotline.
