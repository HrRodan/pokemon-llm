## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CAS265** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized, single-use event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that is technically not obtainable through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Special Acquisition**). While a nominal cost exists in the data, these items cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts and are distributed via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it spawns a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (denoted by the internal variable in the flavor text). This allows players to encounter rare or version-exclusive Pokémon regardless of the current den rotations or weather conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating an encounter. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for farming specific Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs) or Hidden Abilities provided by Raid rewards.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but the resulting Raid encounter is a primary source for Dynamax Shards and high-tier items like Exp. Candies and TRs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **special promotional events** or serial codes (often through retail partnerships or pre-order bonuses). Once the code is redeemed and the item is used, it disappears from the inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-exclusive distribution item meant to facilitate unique community "Raid" events at the **Watchtower Ruins**, a landmark known in Galar lore as a focal point for Power Spot energy.
