## Identity & Utility
**Psyduck Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with concentrated energy. Unlike standard candies that target a single attribute, this item is tailored specifically for the Psyduck evolutionary line to boost their overall potential. It is a **Consumable** item that can be sold for a nominal fee.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When administered to a **Psyduck** or **Golduck**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. This is processed via the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Format-Specific. This item is essential for "Max AV" training in *Let's Go* competitive formats, allowing a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat, making it far superior to standard stat-specific candies (like Health Candy) for this specific species.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly restricted to the **Psyduck** family. It does not trigger evolution but is the most efficient way to reach the stat ceiling for these specific Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not typically found in Marts. It is primarily acquired by:
    1. **Transferring:** Sending caught Psyduck or Golduck to **Professor Oak**.
    2. **Catch Combos:** Successfully chaining the capture of wild Psyduck.
    3. **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking with a Psyduck in the physical Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; it is generated as a reward for capture or transfer mechanics. While it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, it is the primary "farming" currency for optimizing a Golduck for end-game "Master Trainer" battles.
