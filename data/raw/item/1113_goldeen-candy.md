## Identity & Utility
**Goldeen Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy tailored to the biological makeup of the Goldeen evolutionary line. When fed to a compatible Pokémon, it provides a comprehensive boost to its growth. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily earned through gameplay actions rather than purchased at a standard Mart.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Its low cost reflects its role as a common reward for catching Pokémon rather than a luxury commercial item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Goldeen** or **Seaking**, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously in the form of **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* mechanics. While it is essential for optimizing Pokémon for **Master Trainer** battles and LGPE-specific competitive formats, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats (Generations VIII and IX) as the AV system was replaced by the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Rare Candies which increase Level, this item focuses on **Stat Training**. It is the most efficient way to reach the +200 AV cap in every stat for a Seaking, as it bypasses the size-based restrictions of generic candies (e.g., Mighty Candy L).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in traditional Poké Marts. It is acquired primarily by **transferring Goldeen or Seaking to Professor Oak** or as a reward for **catching multiple Goldeen in a Catch Combo**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the "Capture Research" mechanic.
* **Lore Context:** In the Kanto region (LGPE), Professor Oak processes caught Pokémon to create these candies, allowing trainers to strengthen their specific partners through a specialized nutrition system. It represents the "grind" of a trainer specializing in Water-type Pokémon, specifically those focusing on the "Goldfish Pokémon" family.
