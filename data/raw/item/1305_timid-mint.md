## Identity & Utility
**Timid Mint** is a **Nature Mint** (Enhancer) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized aromatic herb used to modify a Pokémon's growth patterns. When consumed, it shifts the Pokémon's stat multipliers to favor Speed at the expense of Attack. It is a **Consumable** item that, while having a low internal cost, is treated as a high-value endgame resource.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; while the internal value is low, it typically retails for 20,000 Poké Dollars or 50 BP in specialized post-game shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently changes the Pokémon's stat growth modifiers to match the **Timid** Nature (+10% Speed, -10% Attack). 
* **Mechanical Nuance:** It is important to note that the Mint does **not** change the Pokémon's actual Nature name or its Berry preferences (e.g., if a Pokémon was originally Brave, it will still dislike Spicy flavors and the summary will still say "Brave"), but the visible stats will reflect the Timid profile.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Staple.** The Timid Mint is vital for optimizing Special Attackers ( like Flutter Mane or Iron Valiant) and fast Support Pokémon. It allows players to make Legendaries or Shiny Pokémon competitively viable without the need for intensive "soft-resetting" or breeding for specific Natures.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a stat-management tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in post-game locations such as the **Battle Tower (BP Shop)** in Galar and Sinnoh, or purchased from **Chansey Supply** outlets in the Paldea region. It can also be obtained as a high-tier reward from Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is considered a processed or rare medicinal item specifically for professional Trainers.
