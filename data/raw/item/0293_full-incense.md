## Identity & Utility
**Full Incense** is a **Specialized Held Item (Incense)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An exotic-smelling incense that makes the holder "bloated and slow-moving." It is a permanent held item that is primarily used for its negative speed priority in battle or its specific biological effect during breeding.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect (Battle):** The holder will always move last within its move’s priority bracket, regardless of its Speed stat. 
    * **Priority Nuance:** If multiple Pokémon in the same priority bracket are affected by this item (or the Lagging Tail), the Pokémon with the *lower* Speed stat actually moves first among them. 
    * **Trick Room:** This item ignores Trick Room mechanics; the holder still moves last.
    * **Stall Interaction:** The holder moves after Pokémon with the *Stall* ability. If a Pokémon with *Stall* holds this item, the ability is ignored in favor of the item's effect.
* **Secondary Effect (Breeding):** When held by a **Snorlax** at a Pokémon Day Care or Nursery, the resulting Egg will hatch into a **Munchlax**. Without this item, Snorlax produces Snorlax Eggs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low; no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered a **Negative Item**. Its primary competitive niche is "Trick" or "Switcheroo" sets (e.g., on Lopunny or Whimsicott) to force the opponent's fast sweepers to move last, effectively neutralizing their Speed advantage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at specialized Incense shops in various regions (such as the Slateport City Market in Hoenn or the incense merchant in Hulbury).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is the exclusive "Baby Trigger" item for the **Munchlax** evolutionary line. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or found as a Poké Ball item in the overworld.
