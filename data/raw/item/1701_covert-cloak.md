## Identity & Utility
**Covert Cloak** is a held-item introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet).
* **Description:** A hooded cloak that conceals the wearer, providing a tactical shroud against incoming disruptions. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is commercially available but carries a premium price tag.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive; reflects its high-tier competitive utility).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Protects the holder from the **additional effects** of moves. This renders the holder immune to secondary effects such as flinching (e.g., from *Fake Out*), status conditions (e.g., burns from *Scald* or *Flamethrower*), and stat reductions (e.g., Speed drops from *Icy Wind*) that occur as a result of an opponent's damaging attack.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Minimal impact when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **High-Tier Competitive Staple**. In VGC (Doubles), it is primarily used to ignore *Fake Out* pressure, ensuring a Pokémon can execute its move on Turn 1. It is also the definitive counter to the move *Salt Cure*, as it prevents the debilitating chip damage associated with the move's secondary effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It functions mechanically like a held version of the **Shield Dust** ability. It does not protect against primary status moves (e.g., *Will-O-Wisp* or *Thunder Wave*), only the secondary chances attached to damaging moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, it is a specialty item stocked at **Delibird Presents** branches (notably in Cascarrafa) after the player has made sufficient progress (usually after earning a specific number of Gym Badges).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not currently found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly a retail or overworld discovery item. Its high cost and specific utility suggest it is a piece of advanced tactical gear rather than a natural object.
