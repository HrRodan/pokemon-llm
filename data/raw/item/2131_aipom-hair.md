## Identity & Utility
**Aipom Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of hair shed by an Aipom. It is a specialized crafting reagent used primarily at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 30 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Common crafting ingredient).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region and its surrounding areas (such as Kitakami). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in a competitive battle setting (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held or used during combat. Its value is strictly limited to the **out-of-battle economy** and move-set preparation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX crafting ecosystem, where it is used alongside League Points to "print" moves for a trainer's roster.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching members of the Aipom evolutionary line (Aipom or Ambipom) in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; rather, it is a **guaranteed or high-probability drop** following an encounter. In the Paldea/Kitakami ecosystems, these materials represent the biological traces left behind by Pokémon, which are then repurposed through high-tech manufacturing to store move data.
* **Context:** Found most frequently in the **Land of Kitakami** (Teal Mask DLC), where Aipom and Ambipom are indigenous, as they are not present in the base Paldea Pokédex.
