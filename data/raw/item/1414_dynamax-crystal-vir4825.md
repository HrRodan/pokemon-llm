## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Vir4825** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a **Consumable** item that, once used, causes a specific Pokémon (determined by the crystal's ID) to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**; primarily distributed via external serial codes rather than in-game shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Wild Area’s Watchtower Ruins), it activates a Max Raid Battle. This specific crystal is tied to a promotional encounter, typically allowing players to battle and catch a **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression/utility item used outside of battle to facilitate the acquisition of Pokémon. However, the resulting Pokémon (Gigantamax Corviknight) has significant competitive value in VGC and Smogon formats due to its Mirror Armor ability and bulk.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It serves as a "summoning" key for the Max Raid mechanic. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was traditionally distributed via **Serial Codes** during special retail promotions (such as those at CoroCoro or European retailers like Micromania/Gamer). It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended for event-based distribution to drive engagement with the Wild Area’s Raid mechanics.
