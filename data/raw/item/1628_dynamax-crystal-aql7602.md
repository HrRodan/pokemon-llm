## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQL7602** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, single-use consumable item categorized as a Dynamax Crystal. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is an event-exclusive item that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal value; however, it is typically acquired via promotional serial codes rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area), the player can use this crystal to force a Max Raid Battle to spawn. This specific crystal (AQL7602) is tied to a unique encounter—historically associated with promotional distributions such as **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. While the item itself has no competitive battle utility, the Pokémon caught from the resulting Max Raid often possess high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or the Gigantamax Factor, making them highly valuable for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through Marts or natural gameplay. It was distributed as a **special promotional bonus** (often via serial codes provided by retailers like Ghibli or through pre-order bonuses). Once the crystal is used and the Raid is completed or the day ends, the item is consumed.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It exists strictly as an external distribution item to facilitate "Event Raids" on demand.
