## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (SCO5928)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it causes a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal code SCO5928) to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; however, this item is traditionally distributed via serial codes and is not available in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty den in the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. This raid encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While the item itself has no battle effect, Dynamax Crystals were historically used to give players access to rare Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax forms, which are essential for building competitive teams in the VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Special Event/Serial Code only.** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed through promotional events, such as retail partnerships (e.g., GameStop, EB Games) or as bonuses for purchasing the Expansion Pass or Dual Packs. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to the player's Bag (Other Items pocket) until consumed.
* **Lore Context:** These crystals are concentrated masses of Galar Particle energy that can force a Dynamax phenomenon to occur in a specific, dormant Power Spot.
