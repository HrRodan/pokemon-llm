## Identity & Utility
**TR02 (Flamethrower)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach the move **Flamethrower** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike modern TMs, Technical Records (TRs) are **consumable** and break after one use, reflecting the high-powered nature of the moves they contain.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for **Watts (W)** in the Galar region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flamethrower**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Fire-type Special Attack. Power: 90 | Accuracy: 100%. 
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to leave the target with a **Burn**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the disc.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Essential.** Flamethrower is the gold standard for reliable Fire-type special coverage. It is preferred over Fire Blast in competitive builds (Smogon/VGC) that prioritize 100% accuracy and consistency over raw power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a vital resource for Special Attackers (such as Charizard, Arcanine, or Togekiss) to handle Steel, Grass, Bug, and Ice types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily in **Pokémon Sword and Shield**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (inventory rotates daily) or received as a reward for defeating Fire-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly tied to Raid rewards, regional currency exchanges (Watts), or finding specific Poké Ball loot drops in the overworld.
* **Economic Value:** At 10,000 Poké Dollars, it represents a high-tier investment, as Flamethrower is considered one of the most reliable and powerful "mid-to-high" tier moves in a Pokémon's kit.
