## Identity & Utility
**Bicycle** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A folding Bicycle designed for rapid transit across various terrains. It is a **Key Item** that is significantly faster than Running Shoes. It is **Not for sale** and cannot be consumed or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In many regions, its retail price is humorously set at 1,000,000 Poké Dollars, exceeding the player's wallet capacity and requiring a Voucher or special gift to obtain.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Dramatically increases movement speed when used in the overworld or inside caves. This specific iteration (referencing the Hoenn-style "folding" mechanics) features "High Gear" capabilities, allowing the trainer to generate enough momentum to ascend muddy slopes or hop over specific rock formations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a strictly utility-based item used for navigation and efficiency during the story and post-game exploration.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. However, it is essential for accessing specific "bike-only" routes (such as Cycling Road) and reaching hidden areas containing TMs or rare items that require crossing cracked floors or steep inclines.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained as a gift from a Bike Shop owner (e.g., Rydel in Mauville City or the Cycle Shop in Cerulean City). In the Hoenn region, the "folding" nature allowed for two distinct modes: the **Mach Bike** (speed/slopes) and the **Acro Bike** (stunts/narrow rails). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind tool tied to the player's inventory.
