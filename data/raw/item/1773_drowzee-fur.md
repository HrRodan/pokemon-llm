## Identity & Utility
**Drowzee Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of fur shed or dropped by the Drowzee evolutionary line. Within the Paldea region ecosystem, this item serves as a specialized crafting ingredient used at Technical Machine (TM) Machines to create move-teaching discs. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any tactical advantage.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a specific resource required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is a component for TMs such as **TM016 (Psybeam)**, **TM067 (Fire Punch)**, **TM068 (Thunder Punch)**, and **TM069 (Ice Punch)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battling format; it is strictly an overworld crafting and progression resource.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is exclusively categorized as a material for the TM Machine and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle-functional capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Drowzee family. It is typically found in the inventory's "TM Materials" pocket and can be exchanged for LP (League Points) at a TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop from wild **Drowzee** and **Hypno** encountered in the field. Players frequently farm this item in areas like the Southern Province or near ruins where Psychic-type Pokémon are prevalent.
