## Identity & Utility
**PP-Up** is a **Vitamin (Medicine)** introduced in **Generation I** (and cataloged here in its Generation IV iteration).
* **Description:** A specialized medicine designed to permanently enhance a Pokémon's move endurance. It is a **Consumable** item that is **usable both in the overworld and during battle** (though battle usage is strictly for the Happiness boost/item consumption, as the PP cap increase is permanent).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its status as a premium performance enhancer.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it increases the maximum PP of a single selected move by **20% of its base value**. This effect can be applied up to **three times** per move, reaching a total maximum of **160% (1.6x)** of the move's original PP. It also provides a modest boost to the Pokémon's Happiness (Friendship) by 5, 3, or 2 points depending on the current Happiness tier.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Staple.** In competitive formats (Smogon, VGC), it is standard practice to maximize the PP of every move. This is critical for stall wars and for moves with low base PP (such as *Recover*, *Hydro Pump*, or *Close Combat*), where having 8 uses instead of 5 can determine the outcome of a long match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is categorized as a "Vitamin," meaning it interacts with mechanics that track medicine usage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game Poke Marts, Department Stores, or the Battle Frontier/Battle Maison for BP (Battle Points). Due to its high cost and high utility, it is often a rare find in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** typically held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a frequent reward for players utilizing the **Pickup** ability at higher levels (typically Level 81-100), making high-level "Pickup squads" the most efficient way to farm this item without spending currency.
* **Hierarchy:** It is the base-tier version of the **PP Max**, which provides the full three-stage PP boost (60% increase) in a single application.
