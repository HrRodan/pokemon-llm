## Identity & Utility
**Black Apricorn** is an **Apricorn (Crafting Material)** introduced in Generation II (Johto) and featured prominently in the Generation IV remakes.
* **Description:** A raw, naturally occurring fruit with a "scent beyond one’s experience." It functions as a specialized crafting ingredient rather than a direct-use item. In the Johto region, it is a consumable resource used by master craftsmen to create custom Poké Balls.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; however, it is primarily harvested from trees rather than purchased from traditional Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When given to the NPC **Kurt** in **Azalea Town**, he will craft it into a **Heavy Ball**. This process traditionally takes 24 hours. The resulting Heavy Ball is a specialized capture device that provides a higher catch rate modifier based on the weight of the target Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; provides no additional effect when thrown via the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Indirect. The item itself has no competitive battle utility. However, it is highly valued by the "Apriball" collecting community. The **Heavy Ball** it produces is a competitive staple for catching heavy-weight legendary or competitive Pokémon (like Heatran, Metagross, or Snorlax) and for passing down the unique Poké Ball aesthetic through breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is stored in the **Apricorn Box** (in Gen IV) rather than the standard items pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found on daily-resetting Apricorn trees throughout the Johto region. Notable locations for Black Apricorn trees include **Route 31, Route 33, and Route 37**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a floral resource.
* **Lore Context:** Apricorns represent the ancient, traditional method of catching Pokémon. Before the mass production of modern Poké Balls by corporations like Silph Co., specialists like Kurt hand-carved these fruits into functional capture devices. The Black Apricorn specifically utilizes the density of the fruit to create a ball that better restrains massive, heavy opponents.
