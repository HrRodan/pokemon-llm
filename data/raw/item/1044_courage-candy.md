## Identity & Utility
**Courage Candy** is a **Vitamin** (specifically a Stat Candy) introduced in **Generation VII**, appearing exclusively in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A candy packed with energy used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's growth. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used from the bag to increase a Pokémon's Special Defense stat through the "Awakened Value" (AV) system. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Its low price reflects its role as a high-volume consumable meant to be used in large quantities to optimize a Pokémon's stats.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases a Pokémon's **Special Defense by 1 point** in its Awakened Value (AV) pool. Unlike traditional EVs (Effort Values), AVs can reach up to 200 in every stat, and this basic Courage Candy is the entry-level tier for this progression.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held and the move Fling is absent from the games in which this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** This item is only relevant within the *Let's Go* ecosystem. AVs are typically disabled in "Standard Rules" online play (which caps stats at Level 50 without AVs) but are central to "No Rules" battles. It is useless in traditional VGC or Smogon formats from other generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is part of a three-tier hierarchy: **Courage Candy** (Basic), **Courage Candy L**, and **Courage Candy XL**. The basic version is generally restricted to Pokémon of lower levels or those that haven't reached high AV thresholds.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Pokémon or by "transferring" Pokémon to Professor Oak in the *Let's Go* series. It is also rewarded for walking a Pokémon using the Poké Ball Plus peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the **Capture Mechanic**. Catching Pokémon that naturally excel in Special Defense (such as Tentacool or Drowzee) increases the likelihood of receiving Courage Candies as a post-capture reward.
