## Identity & Utility
**Charmander Candy** is a **Species-specific Stat-Booster** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with energy. Unlike standard candies that increase Level or a single stat, this item is designed to enhance the overall potential of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that can be sold but is generally obtained through gameplay mechanics rather than traditional Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low sell value, its utility in optimization far outweighs its monetary cost.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon from the **Charmander evolutionary line** (Charmander, Charmeleon, or Charizard), it increases **all six stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. This utilizes the **AV (Awakening Value)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is a staple for "Master Trainer" challenges and competitive battling within the *Let's Go* ecosystem, as it allows a Pokémon to reach its maximum stat ceiling. It does not exist in the standard EV/IV systems of mainline titles like *Scarlet/Violet*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted to the **Charmander family**. It does not trigger evolution; rather, it functions as a comprehensive "Vitamin" specifically tailored for this species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily acquired by **sending Charmander, Charmeleon, or Charizard to Professor Oak** (releasing them). It is also rewarded for achieving high **Catch Combos** of wild Charmander or by walking with a Pokémon in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through the "Transfer" mechanic, representing the research data and energy gathered from studying multiple specimens of the same species.
