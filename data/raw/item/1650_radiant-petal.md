## Identity & Utility
**Radiant Petal** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically in the *Sword & Shield: The Crown Tundra* expansion).
* **Description:** A glowing, ethereal petal gifted to the player by Calyrex. As a Key Item, it is non-consumable, cannot be held by Pokémon in battle, and cannot be discarded. It serves as a critical narrative bridge to unlock the full power of the King of Bountiful Harvests.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique quest item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Radiant Petal is a crafting component. When combined with a tuft of hair from the King's Steed (either the **Icy Mane** from Glastrier or the **Spectral Mane** from Spectrier), it is used to forge the **Reins of Unity**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and form-unlocking mechanics. It does not provide any stat boosts or combat effects.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon in the traditional sense, it is the prerequisite for obtaining the **Reins of Unity**, the tool required to fuse Calyrex with its steed to become **Calyrex Ice Rider** or **Calyrex Shadow Rider**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained exclusively during the main storyline of *The Crown Tundra*. It is given to the player by **Calyrex** in Freezington after the player helps the legendary Pokémon regain a portion of its power and identifies the location of its lost steed.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact tied to the lore of the Galar region's ancient royalty.
* **Lore Context:** The petal represents the "Bountiful Harvest" power of Calyrex. It radiates a faint light, symbolizing the life-giving energy the King used to provide for the people and Pokémon of the Crown Tundra.
