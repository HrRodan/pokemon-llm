## Identity & Utility
**Item Urge** is a **Miracle Shooter** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized battle-only consumable used within the Wonder Launcher (Miracle Shooter) mechanic. It is designed to manipulate the timing of held items, allowing a trainer to force an ally to use their item regardless of whether the standard activation conditions have been met. It is a **Consumable Battle Prop** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired via accumulated points during Miracle Shooter battles).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon in battle, it selects a friendly Pokémon at random and forcibly activates its held item. This only applies to **conditional items**—those that trigger under specific circumstances (e.g., Berries, White Herb, Focus Sash). It has no effect on passive/continuous items like Leftovers or Life Orb.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists only within the Wonder Launcher interface and cannot be held or thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The Wonder Launcher was a niche side-mechanic in *Pokémon Black, White, B2, and W2*. It is prohibited in standard VGC and Smogon formats, as it functions like "Items in Battle" for multiplayer.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It specifically interacts with held items that have a "trigger" mechanism (e.g., triggering a **Sitrus Berry** even if the Pokémon is at full HP).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** (Miracle Shooter) mode in Generation V. Players accumulate points over the course of turns in a battle and "buy" the use of Item Urge once they have earned enough points (typically 4 points).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, as it does not exist as a physical inventory item in the player's bag outside of the Miracle Shooter interface.
