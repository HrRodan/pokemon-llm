## Identity & Utility
**Coba Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A holdable, consumable Berry that acts as a defensive measure against aerial assaults. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that is consumed immediately upon use. While it has a nominal value, it is rarely bought in stores and is typically acquired through cultivation or foraging.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though primarily obtained via farming).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it halves the damage taken from a single **super-effective Flying-type attack**. The Berry is consumed instantly upon activation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally not recommended for Fling strategies unless the user has the *Unburden* ability).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Flying-type** attack with **80 Power** (Gen VI+) or 60 Power (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche/Counter-Meta staple**. It is most frequently equipped on Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Flying (such as **Breloom**, **Virizion**, or **Buzzwole**) to survive a surprise *Brave Bird* or *Max Airstream* and allow for a counter-attack or setup.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles the damage reduction to 75%) and **Harvest** (allows the berry to be restored after consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in Berry Piles, given by Berry-related NPCs (like the Berry Master), or won through specific in-game lotteries/shops (e.g., Join Avenue or the Battle Frontier). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Sunkern**. In many regional iterations, players must farm this item by planting it in soft soil to increase their inventory, as it is a single-use consumable.
* **Flavor Context:** Its bitter-sweet profile is said to be an acquired taste, mirrors its tactical use as a specific "Bitter" surprise for Flying-type attackers expecting an easy knockout.
