## Identity & Utility
**Spooky Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with a mysterious message. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that can be held by any Pokémon to enhance spectral energy. It is marked with the `underground` attribute, signifying its historical origin as a buried treasure in the Sinnoh region.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically found through exploration rather than purchased in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the power of the holder’s **Ghost-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Multitype Interaction:** If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (specifically **Arceus**), the holder’s primary type changes to **Ghost**. Additionally, the move **Judgment** becomes Ghost-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High base damage when thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a mandatory item for the **Ghost-type Arceus** form, which is a top-tier threat in "Ubers" formats due to its high speed, bulk, and access to *Will-O-Wisp* and *Calm Mind*. For non-legendary Pokémon, it is generally outclassed by *Spell Tag* (which has no secondary effects) or *Life Orb*, though it remains a viable choice to avoid the recoil of a Life Orb while boosting Ghost STAB.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the ability **Multitype**. It cannot be removed or stolen via *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick* if the holder is Arceus.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically discovered in the **Sinnoh Underground** or at specific landmarks like the **Old Chateau** (Diamond/Pearl) or **Route 215** (Platinum). In later generations, it is often found in deep-sea trenches or gifted by NPCs interested in ancient history.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is traditionally a unique find or "Key-like" collectible that persists across games to ensure Arceus can access all its forms.
* **Lore Context:** One of the many plates said to be fragments of the original power used by the Alpha Pokémon to shape the universe. The inscription typically references the power of spirits or the overcoming of death.
