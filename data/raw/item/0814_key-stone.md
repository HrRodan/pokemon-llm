## Identity & Utility
**Key Stone** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation VI** (though cataloged here under its Generation VII appearance).
* **Description:** A mysterious stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. It reacts to a Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone, allowing it to undergo a temporary, mid-battle transformation. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by the Trainer, it grants the ability to **Mega Evolve** one Pokémon per battle, provided that Pokémon is holding its specific, corresponding Mega Stone (e.g., Lucarionite for Lucario).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta-Defining Impact.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Gen 6 and 7), the Key Stone is the mechanical requirement for the single most powerful shift in battle. It allows a Pokémon to gain a massive +100 base stat increase, potential type changes, and new abilities mid-turn. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard evolution items, this does not cause a permanent change. It functions only in battle. It bypasses the "no two items" restriction by residing in the Trainer's bag rather than a Pokémon's item slot.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained through significant story milestones rather than shops. In *Sun/Moon* and *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*, it is obtained from Sina and Dexio at Poni Island after becoming the Champion. In earlier regions, it is often gifted by a "Mega Evolution Successor" or mentor figure.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool designated for Trainers who have achieved a specific level of bond and skill.
* **Lore Context:** The Key Stone is often set into "Mega Accessories" such as the Mega Ring, Mega Bracelet, or Mega Glove. It symbolizes the resonance between the hearts of a Trainer and their Pokémon, manifesting that bond as raw physical and elemental power.
