## Identity & Utility
**TR52 (Gyro Ball)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Gyro Ball**, a Steel-type Physical attack. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are **consumable, single-use items** that break after teaching the move. It is a specialized training tool primarily utilized by slow, bulky attackers.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (or Watts). While priced at 6,000 in general commerce, it is most frequently acquired through the **Watt Economy** for a moderate price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Gyro Ball**. This move calculates damage based on the Speed stat difference between the user and the target. The slower the user is relative to the opponent, the higher the move's base power (capped at a maximum of 150).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling with a TR is generally discouraged as it provides negligible damage and consumes the item.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Competitive.** This TR is essential for "Trick Room" archetypes and slow Steel-type staples such as **Ferrothorn, Stakataka, Bronzong, and Copperajah**. It turns a low Speed stat into a high-damage offensive asset, specifically countering fast "glass cannon" Sweepers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Machine" item, meaning its primary interaction is with a Pokémon's move-pool compatibility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR52 is primarily obtained by defeating Steel-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** found throughout the Wild Area. The inventory of Watt Traders rotates daily, making it a "common but inconsistent" find.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically farmed through the **Max Raid Battle** loop or by accumulating Watts through the exploration of the Wild Area and the Isle of Armor/Crown Tundra.
