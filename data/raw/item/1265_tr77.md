## Identity & Utility
**TR77 (Grass Knot)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach the move **Grass Knot** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, making them a consumable resource. It is a specialized teaching tool designed for tactical coverage.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive/Mid-tier). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for Watts (W) at Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Grass Knot**. This Special Grass-type move calculates damage based on the target's weight:
    * **< 22.0 lbs (10 kg):** 20 Power
    * **22.0–55.1 lbs (10–25 kg):** 40 Power
    * **55.1–110.2 lbs (25–50 kg):** 60 Power
    * **110.2–220.5 lbs (50–100 kg):** 80 Power
    * **220.5–440.9 lbs (100–200 kg):** 100 Power
    * **> 440.9 lbs (200 kg):** 120 Power
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; generally ineffective for Fling strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Niche/Coverage Staple.** Grass Knot is a vital coverage move for Special Attackers (including non-Grass types like Alakazam or Greninja) to punish heavy-weight threats. It is particularly effective in formats with "restricted" Legendaries, as many Uber-tier Pokémon (like Groudon, Kyogre, and Tyranitar) are extremely heavy and thus take maximum (120) base power damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon successful teaching.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR77 is primarily rewarded for defeating Grass-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a piece of synthesized technology rather than a natural object. It is often farmed by players through high-level Max Raid Dens to ensure a steady supply for competitive team building.
