## Identity & Utility
**Charizardite Y** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** This mysterious stone is a specialized held item that enables Charizard to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. Unlike standard consumables, it is a permanent held item that does not disappear after use, though it cannot be consumed or transferred easily in battle. It is one of two unique Mega Stones available to Charizard, representing the "Y" divergent evolutionary path.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through special events, NPC gifts, or high-level battle facilities like the Battle Tree).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Charizard, it allows the Pokémon to Mega Evolve into **Mega Charizard Y** provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. This transformation occurs at the start of the turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: In practice, Mega Stones cannot be successfully used with Fling if the holder is capable of Mega Evolving).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Mega Charizard Y is a premier wallbreaker in Smogon and VGC formats (Generations VI–VII). Upon Mega Evolving, it gains the **Drought** ability, instantly setting harsh sunlight. This boosts its Fire-type attacks to nuclear levels and allows for instantaneous **Solar Beam** execution, making it the definitive "Sun Team" centerpiece.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Charizard. It does not trigger a permanent evolution but a temporary mid-battle transformation. It is unaffected by most item-removing moves (like Knock Off or Thief) when held by Charizard.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is obtained from Professor Sycamore in Lumiose City (if Charmander was chosen) or purchased from the Stone Emporium. In *Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained as a reward at the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure, often tied to the lore of the "Bond Phenomenon" and the history of the Kalos region. Unlike many items, it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
