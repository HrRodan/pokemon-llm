## Identity & Utility
**Tunnel Mail** is an **All-Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** Stationery featuring a distinct print of a dimly lit coal mine, reflecting the industrial themes of the Sinnoh region (specifically Oreburgh City). It is a **Consumable/Held** communication item that is primarily used to send short, preset messages to other players during Pokémon trades. 
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer can compose a message from a finite list of phrases and give the item to a Pokémon to hold. The recipient of the Pokémon can read the message and either store it in their PC or erase it to reuse the stationery.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Item Protection:** While a Pokémon is holding Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC**. Additionally, any move that attempts to remove, steal, or swap the item (such as *Thief*, *Covet*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo*) will automatically **fail**.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move *Fling*).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically used as a **niche tech** in older generations to prevent a Pokémon from losing its held item to "Trick" users, though it offers no statistical or tactical benefits otherwise. In modern titles, Mail has been largely phased out in favor of direct communication.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a social and protective utility item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Pokémon Marts within the Sinnoh region, most notably in **Oreburgh City**, fitting the "Tunnel" and coal-mining aesthetic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased by the Trainer.
* **Lore Context:** Represents the early-generation social mechanics of the Pokémon series, where player interaction was limited to pre-selected vocabulary to ensure safe communication across the Global Trade Station (GTS).
