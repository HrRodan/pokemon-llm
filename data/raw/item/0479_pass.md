## Identity & Utility
**Pass** (commonly known as the **Magnet Train Pass**) is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in Generation II (with current data reflecting its Generation IV HeartGold/SoulSilver iteration).
* **Description:** A specialized commuter ticket required to access the high-speed Magnet Train. It functions as a permanent pass, allowing the player to travel between the Johto and Kanto regions an unlimited number of times. As a Key Item, it is not consumable and cannot be discarded or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale/Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the Trainer immediate access to the Magnet Train stations located in **Goldenrod City** (Johto) and **Saffron City** (Kanto). It is the fastest method of inter-regional travel, bypassing the need to surf through Tohjo Falls or use the S.S. Aqua.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for world navigation and plot progression during the post-game content of the Johto-based adventures.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not interact with Pokémon evolution or battle abilities. It is strictly a "utility gate" item that remains in the Key Items pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for completing a specific sub-quest in Saffron City. The player must return the **Lost Item** (found in the Vermilion City Pokémon Fan Club) to the **Copycat** in Saffron City. 
* **Lore Context:** The Magnet Train represents the technological bridge between the Johto and Kanto regions. The Pass is only functional after the player has restored power to the Kanto Power Plant, making it a symbol of the player's progress in revitalizing the region's infrastructure.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability.
