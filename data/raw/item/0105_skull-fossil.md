## Identity & Utility
**Skull Fossil** is a **Dex-Completion Fossil** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A fossilized fragment of a prehistoric land-dwelling Pokémon's cranium. It is a **Consumable Key Item** (once handed over for revival) that can be sold for a high price but is primarily used for biological restoration.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high sell value, its utility in completing the Pokédex usually outweighs the monetary gain.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specialized facility—such as the **Mining Museum in Oreburgh City** or the **Museum of Science in Pewter City**—it can be regenerated into the Rock-type Pokémon **Cranidos** at Level 5 (Gen IV) or Level 20 (later gens).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (Extremely High). While technically usable with the move Fling, the item is destroyed upon use, making this a very costly 100-power Dark-type attack.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive viability as a held item. However, it is the sole source of **Cranidos**, which evolves into **Rampardos**, a Pokémon known for possessing one of the highest base Attack stats among non-Legendary Pokémon (165).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the precursor to the Cranidos line. It is historically a **version-exclusive** counterpart to the Armor Fossil (Shieldon).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut generation, it is found primarily in the **Sinnoh Underground** via the mining minigame. It is traditionally exclusive to **Pokémon Diamond**, **Black**, and **Brilliant Diamond**. In later games, it can often be purchased from specialized fossil shops (e.g., Konikoni City in Alola) or found via Rock Smash.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be extracted from the earth through mining or geological surveying, often associated with the **Underground** attribute.
* **Lore context:** The Skull Fossil represents a "glass cannon" archetype in prehistoric Pokémon history; the resulting Cranidos and Rampardos are characterized by incredibly thick skulls used for powerful headbutts, but they lack the defensive durability found in their counterpart, Shieldon.
