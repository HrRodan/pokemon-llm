## Identity & Utility
**Shiny Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh Region)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone that shines with a dazzling light, capable of triggering evolution in specific Pokémon species. It is a **Consumable** item used from the bag; it is not meant to be held for a passive benefit.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate). While it has a defined price, it is rarely available in standard Poké Marts, often functioning as a rare collectible or a reward for exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used directly on a Pokémon in the party, it triggers an immediate evolution. The stone is consumed upon use.
    * **Compatible Pokémon:** Evolves **Togetic** into Togekiss, **Roselia** into Roserade, **Minccino** into Cinccino, and **Floette** into Florges.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. This provides significant damage if used with the move **Fling**, though it is highly inefficient as the stone is lost permanently.
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is vital for competitive play solely for access to **Togekiss**, a perennial staple in VGC and Smogon formats due to its *Serene Grace* ability and Air Slash flinch-strategies. It is also the gateway to **Roserade**, a high-tier Special Attacker and hazard setter.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the "standard" elemental stones (Fire, Water, Leaf), the Shiny Stone is part of the "Advanced Evolution" group alongside the Dusk and Dawn Stones, typically gated behind mid-to-late game progression.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually discovered in specific locations (e.g., Iron Island, Route 6, or the Dusty Bowl) or obtained via special mini-games like **Super Training** or the **Cram-o-matic**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is most reliably "farmed" via the **Pickup** ability; Pokémon at higher levels (typically Level 41+) have a small percentage chance to find a Shiny Stone after a battle. It is also a frequent reward for defeating specific trainers in rematches or through the **Poke Pelago** in Generation VII.
