## Identity & Utility
**Swablu Fluff** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A crafting ingredient shed by the Swablu evolutionary line. It is a consumable material used primarily at the TM Machine to manufacture Technical Machines. Unlike traditional held items, it is stored in the dedicated "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific currency/component for crafting TMs. In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, it is required to create specific moves that align with Swablu's traits (such as **TM079 Dazzling Gleam**, **TM115 Dragon Pulse**, and **TM160 Hurricane**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the "out-of-battle" preparation phase, allowing trainers to teach essential moves to their competitive roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Material Loot" mechanic where drops are gathered by defeating wild Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively as a drop in the Paldea region (and other Gen IX areas). It cannot be purchased from standard Poké Marts; it must be farmed through exploration and combat.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is dropped 100% of the time upon defeating or catching wild **Swablu** or **Altaria**. It is most efficiently gathered using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where Swablu congregate, such as mountain biomes or grassy plateaus.
