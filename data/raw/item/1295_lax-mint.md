## Identity & Utility
**Lax Mint** is a **Nature-mint** (Consumable Medicine) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herbal item that, when used on a Pokémon, alters its stat growth patterns. It causes the Pokémon's **Defense** to increase more rapidly while its **Special Defense** increases more slowly. Unlike older mechanics, it changes the stat modifiers without changing the Pokémon's actual Nature (important for flavor and certain abilities like *Synchronize*).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Internal value**). While the raw data lists a low cost, in-game utility usually requires significant investment of Battle Points (BP) or high currency amounts at specialized shops like Chansey Supply.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently shifts the Pokémon's stat multipliers to match the **Lax Nature** (+10% Defense, -10% Special Defense). This is applied immediately and persists even if the Pokémon levels up or is placed in a PC box.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Suboptimal.** While Mints are a "Competitive Staple" for optimizing Pokémon without re-breeding, the Lax Nature itself is rarely used in high-level play. Most defensive sets prefer **Bold** or **Impish** (lowering an unused Attack stat) rather than compromising Special Defense.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use. It does not affect the flavor preference of the Pokémon regarding Berries (which is determined by the original, "natural" Nature).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available in post-game locations such as the **Battle Tower** (for 50 BP) in Sword/Shield or **Chansey Supply** shops in Scarlet/Violet (for 20,000 Poké Dollars). It can also be found as a rare drop in high-tier Tera Raid Battles or as a reward for Academy Ace Tournaments.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it must be purchased or earned through battle challenges.
