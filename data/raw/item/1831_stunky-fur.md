## Identity & Utility
**Stunky Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting material shed or harvested from the Stunky evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any beneficial effect.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting component.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no tactical application in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; its value is strictly limited to the pre-battle preparation phase (move acquisition).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Stunky Fur is not used for Pokémon evolution. It is categorized under the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag, making it immune to certain item-removal mechanics that affect held items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Stunky family. It is not sold in Poké Marts or Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Drops:** Commonly dropped by wild **Stunky** and **Skuntank**. In the Paldea region, these are frequently found in grassy biomes or through Tera Raid Battles featuring these specific Poison/Dark-type Pokémon. Unlike traditional held items, these are rewarded directly to the player's inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter.
