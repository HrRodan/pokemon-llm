## Identity & Utility
**TM196 (Flip Turn)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach the move **Flip Turn** to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use items that can be crafted at a TM Machine. As a move-teaching tool, it is essential for expanding the tactical versatility of Water-type physical attackers and pivots.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts). In the context of Generation IX, it is **Special Acquisition** only, requiring 5,000 League Points (LP), 3 Finizen Slime, and 3 Arrokuda Scales at a TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flip Turn**. Flip Turn is a physical Water-type move with 60 Power and 100% Accuracy. Its primary function is a "pivot" mechanic: after dealing damage, the user returns to its Poké Ball and the trainer sends out a replacement Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Flip Turn is the Water-type equivalent of *U-turn* or *Volt Switch*. It is invaluable in VGC and Smogon formats for maintaining "momentum," allowing a player to deal chip damage and switch to a counter-pick while reacting to the opponent's play. It is particularly effective on bulky pivots (like Alomomola) or heavy hitters (like Palafin or Swampert).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, its crafting requires materials dropped by the **Finizen** and **Arrokuda** lines.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available in the **Blueberry Academy** (The Indigo Disk DLC) of Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. It must be crafted at a TM Machine once the recipe is unlocked, or found as a localized pickup in the Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. The crafting materials (Finizen Slime and Arrokuda Scales) are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Finizen**, **Palafin**, **Arrokuda**, and **Barraskewda**.
