## Identity & Utility
**Rusted-sword** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** An ancient, weathered blade that was once used by a hero to save the Galar region. Despite its "rusty and worn" appearance, it serves as a powerful artifact for a specific legendary Pokémon. It is a **Held Item** that functions similarly to a Mega Stone or Orbs (like the Griseous Orb), triggering a permanent form change in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique story-related item that cannot be purchased or sold at Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Zacian**, the Pokémon transforms from its "Hero of Many Battles" form into its **Crowned Sword** form upon entering battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Type Transformation:** Changes Zacian's typing from pure **Fairy** to **Fairy/Steel**, granting it one of the best defensive typing combinations in the game.
    * **Move Transformation:** While held, the move **Iron Head** is automatically replaced by **Behemoth Blade**, a high-damage Steel-type move that deals double damage to Dynamaxed targets.
    * **Stat Boost:** Triggers an immediate increase in Base Stats, specifically boosting Zacian's Attack and Speed to elite tiers.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential/Meta-Defining.** In formats where restricted legendaries are allowed (VGC and Smogon Ubers), the Rusted Sword is mandatory for Zacian. Zacian-Crowned is widely considered one of the most powerful physical attackers in the history of the franchise due to the buffs provided by this item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon but is a **form-change trigger**. It is unaffected by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* when held by Zacian, meaning it cannot be removed or stolen in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained via the main storyline in *Pokémon Sword* (and *Pokémon Shield* via trading or specific events) at the **Slumbering Weald**. It is a legendary artifact tied to the "Hero of Many Battles" lore involving the Darkest Day.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item (excluding events). Because it is a "Species-specific" item, it cannot be utilized by any Pokémon other than Zacian; for all other species, it provides no benefit.
