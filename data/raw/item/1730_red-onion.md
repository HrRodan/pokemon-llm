## Identity & Utility
**Red Onion** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A pungent and sharp-tasting vegetable slice used exclusively in the Picnic sandwich-making mechanic. It is a **Consumable Overworld** item that can be purchased in bulk from specific food vendors.
* **Cost:** 230 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a filling during a Picnic, it modifies the resulting Sandwich's **Meal Powers**. It is a primary source for **Humungo Power**, **Encounter Power**, and **Raid Power**. 
* **Flavor Profile:** It contributes significantly to the **Sweet**, **Bitter**, and **Sour** flavor ratings of a sandwich, which determines the specific Type-focus of the Meal Powers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in standard VGC or Smogon formats. Its utility is strictly restricted to the overworld for utility-based tasks like Shiny hunting, Pokémon breeding (Egg Power), or farming Tera Shards through Raids.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX cooking sub-system and does not interact with battle-relevant abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at retail locations throughout the Paldea region. It can be purchased from **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Sure Cans** outlets once the player has obtained a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or traditional restorative items, this is a processed culinary ingredient available only through human commerce.
* **World Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, Red Onions are essential for trainers looking to target specific Pokémon types, particularly **Ghost-type** Pokémon, as many recipes involving Red Onion enhance Ghost-type Encounter and Raid powers.
