## Identity & Utility
**Blue Apricorn** is an **Apricorn-box** item introduced in Generation II (and featured prominently in Generation IV/HGSS).
* **Description:** A natural, grass-scented fruit used as a raw material for artisanal Poké Ball manufacturing. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be bought for a nominal price, though it is traditionally gathered from the environment.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the Johto region, this item can be delivered to the NPC **Kurt in Azalea Town**. After a 24-hour waiting period, Kurt will craft it into a **Lure Ball**—a specialized Poké Ball with a 4x catch rate multiplier when used on Pokémon encountered via fishing.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. The item itself provides no tactical advantage in battle. Its value is purely "Meta-Competitive," as the resulting **Lure Ball** is highly prized by collectors for "Apriball" matching (pairing a blue or Water-type Pokémon with the Lure Ball's unique aesthetic and entrance animation).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with Kurt’s crafting mechanic and is stored in the **Apricorn Box** rather than the standard Item Pocket in its debut titles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found on Apricorn trees located on **Route 37** (Johto). While the JSON indicates a cost of 200, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts, instead appearing in specialized shops (like the Sportsman's Shop) or via regional-specific mechanics like the Cram-o-matic or auctions in later generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which can be farmed from wild encounters, Blue Apricorns are strictly environmental harvests or purchased materials.
