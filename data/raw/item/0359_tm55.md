## Identity & Utility
**TM55** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding device used to teach a specific Water-type move to compatible Pokémon. As a TM, its behavior regarding consumption varies by generation (single-use in Gen IV and Gen IX; infinite use in Gen V through Gen VIII).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**). This price point typically reflects its status as a high-value offensive or utility move found in Department Stores or provided as a Gym Leader reward.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a Pokémon. The move contained within TM55 has changed across generations:
    * **Generation IV:** Teaches **Brine** (Power 65, doubles to 130 if the target's HP is below 50%).
    * **Generation V – VIII:** Teaches **Scald** (Power 80, 100% Accuracy, 30% chance to Burn the target). 
    * **Generation IX:** Teaches **Chilling Water** (Power 50, 100% Accuracy, lowers target's Attack by 1 stage).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling for damage, or have a base power of 0).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Scald (Gens V-VIII):** A definitive **Competitive Staple**. It is considered one of the best moves in the game for defensive and bulky Water-types (e.g., Toxapex, Slowbro) because the 30% burn chance effectively cripples physical attackers.
        * **Brine (Gen IV):** Niche; used as an "executioner" move but generally outclassed by Surf.
        * **Chilling Water (Gen IX):** Common utility in VGC/Doubles for damage mitigation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In its debut (Gen IV), it is famously awarded by **Gym Leader Crasher Wake** in Pastoria City after his defeat.
    * In subsequent generations (V-VIII), it is often found in aquatic environments or purchased at major Marts (e.g., Driftveil City, Konikoni City).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It must be found as a localized item ball, received from NPCs, or crafted/purchased.
* **Compatibility:** Highly compatible with almost all Water-type Pokémon, as well as several "damp" or "biological" non-Water types (e.g., Mew, Stunfisk).
