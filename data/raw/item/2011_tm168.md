## Identity & Utility
**TM168 (Solar Beam)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)** as part of the expanded TM library, specifically appearing in the base game and *The Indigo Disk* DLC.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use machine used to teach the move **Solar Beam** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are consumable but can be replicated at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Poke Marts; requires **10,000 LP** and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Solar Beam**. Solar Beam is a high-power, two-turn **Grass-type Special move** with a Base Power of 120 and 100% Accuracy.
* **Move Mechanics:**
    * **Turn 1:** The user gathers sunlight.
    * **Turn 2:** The user attacks.
    * **Weather Interaction:** Under **Harsh Sunlight**, the move skips the charging turn and attacks immediately. In Rain, Sandstorm, or Snow, its power is reduced by 50%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for "Sun Teams." It provides vital Grass-type coverage for Fire-type Pokémon (to hit Water, Ground, and Rock types) and is the primary nuke for Pokémon with the **Chlorophyll** ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Grass, Fire, and some Normal-type Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Crafting:** Can be crafted at any TM Machine using **10,000 LP**, **3x Bounsweet Sweat**, **3x Tropius Leaf**, and **3x Exeggcute Shell**.
    * **Overworld:** Typically found as a TM capsule in sunny or high-altitude areas, such as the Glaseado Mountain or the Coastal Biome of the Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be crafted or found as a static pickup. Its presence in the "Indigo Disk" data indicates its inclusion in the expanded Blueberry Academy TM list.
