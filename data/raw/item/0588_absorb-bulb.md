## Identity & Utility
**Absorb Bulb** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A botanical held item that triggers a reactive stat boost. When the holder is struck by a Water-type move, the item is consumed to increase the holder's offensive capabilities. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be bought or found in the wild.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** pricing for competitive consumables).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a **Water-type damaging move**, its **Special Attack rises by one stage (+1)**. The item is consumed immediately upon activation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily a **niche tactical item** used in Double Battles. It is often triggered by a teammate using a low-power or spread Water-type move (such as *Surf* or *Water Shuriken*) to instantly boost a Special Attacker. While similar to the *Weakness Policy*, the Absorb Bulb is safer as it does not require the move to be Super Effective, making it ideal for Grass-type Pokémon who resist the triggering Water move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-oriented consumable. In competitive play (VGC/Smogon), once consumed, it cannot be recovered except through moves like *Recycle* or the ability *Harvest* (though *Harvest* is typically for Berries).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available in post-game Battle Facilities (e.g., Battle Subway, PWT, Battle Maison) for BP, or specialty shops in various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is naturally associated with plant-like Pokémon. It can be found with a 5% rarity on wild **Oddish, Gloom, Vileplume, Bellossom, Roselia, Roserade, Cottonee, Whimsicott, Petilil,** and **Lilligant**. Players can efficiently farm this item using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**.
