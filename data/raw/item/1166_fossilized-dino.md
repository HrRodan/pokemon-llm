## Identity & Utility
**Fossilized Dino** is a **Dex-completion / Fossil** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item represents the upper-body remains of an ancient Pokémon. Despite the flavor text suggesting it "once lived in the sea," it is primarily associated with the Ice-type half of Galar's unique hybrid fossils. It is a **Consumable Revival Item** that cannot be used directly from the bag to evolve a Pokémon but must be processed by a specific NPC.
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**). While it can be sold for a high price, its primary value is in the acquisition of rare Fossil Pokémon.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the researcher **Cara Liss** on Route 6 in the Galar region, it can be combined with another fossil to revive a prehistoric Pokémon. 
    * **Fossilized Dino + Fossilized Bird** = **Arctozolt** (Electric/Ice).
    * **Fossilized Dino + Fossilized Fish** = **Arctovish** (Water/Ice).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High). While fossils are rarely used with the move Fling, the Fossilized Dino deals significant physical damage due to its weight/density.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. The item itself has no on-field utility, but it is the gatekeeper for **Arctozolt**, a potent competitive threat in Hail/Snow teams due to its *Slush Rush* ability and the move *Bolt Beak*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is a "half-fossil." Unlike traditional fossils (like the Helix Fossil) which revive a singular species, this must be paired, representing the "mismatched" fossil lore of the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Pokémon Sword:** Common. Frequently found via the **Digging Duo** (specifically the Reward/Stamina brother) in the Bridge Field area of the Wild Area.
    * **Pokémon Shield:** Rare. While obtainable from the Digging Duo, the drop rate is significantly lower than in the sister version, often requiring trading or extensive "Watt" investment.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through geological excavation (the Digging Duo) or found as hidden items in the **Dusty Bowl**.
* **Lore Context:** The Fossilized Dino is a commentary on early paleontological mistakes where different species' bones were incorrectly assembled. Its existence allows for the creation of Pokémon that otherwise could not exist naturally.
