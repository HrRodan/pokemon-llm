## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Ori1879** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crystal used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Special Acquisition). While it has a internal cost value, it is primarily distributed via serial codes and cannot be bought in Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the player can drop this crystal into the den to force a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, **Ori1879** is the internal designation for the crystal that summons a **Corviknight** (often associated with specific promotional distributions like CoroCoro).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is used exclusively in the overworld to initiate a PvE (Player vs. Environment) raid encounter. It does not provide any statistical benefit in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item serves as a "Raid Trigger." Once the crystal is used and the den is activated, the beam remains active until the player defeats the Pokémon or until midnight of the same day.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed through **Serial Codes** during limited-time promotional events (such as retail partnerships or magazine distributions). It is not available through natural gameplay or the "Pickup" ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. This is a unique digital key used to unlock specific encounter content within the Galar region's Wild Area infrastructure.
