## Identity & Utility
**TM41** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A data disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. From Generation III onwards, this TM teaches the move **Torment**. It is a **Consumable** item in its debut generation and in Generation IX, while it functioned as an infinite-use item in Generations V through VIII.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Standard Machine Pricing**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Torment** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * *Move Effect:* The target is "tormented," preventing it from using the same move twice in a row.
    * *Historical Variance:* While fixed as Torment from Gen III onwards, this TM slot previously contained **Softboiled** (Gen I) and **ThunderPunch** (Gen II).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Disruptor.** Torment is used primarily in stall or "Torment-Protect" strategies. It is exceptionally effective against "Choice" item users (Choice Band, Specs, or Scarf), as the item locks them into one move while the TM effect prevents them from using it consecutively, forcing the opponent to use **Struggle** or switch out.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, primarily Dark-types and those capable of psychological warfare or "mean" behavior.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in major Department Stores (such as Celadon, Goldenrod, or Lilycove) or found in specific overworld locations (e.g., given by a fan in Slateport City’s Contest Hall in the Hoenn region). In Generation IX, it is part of the TM Machine crafting system.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; acquisition is strictly through purchase, gift, or overworld exploration. TMs are man-made devices representing the peak of Pokémon training technology.
