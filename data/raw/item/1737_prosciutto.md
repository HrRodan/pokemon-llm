## Identity & Utility
**Prosciutto** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A savory, cured ham used specifically within the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased at various food supply shops across the Paldea region.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Prosciutto contributes specific "Meal Power" values. It is primarily associated with **Salty** and **Sweet** flavor profiles. It is a key ingredient in recipes targeting **Flying-type** and **Ghost-type** Pokémon (e.g., the Ultra Ham Sandwich or various Great/Master variants).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Sandwich ingredients generally cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and thus have no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in direct combat. However, it is essential for the **Meta-Game** (Breeding and Shiny Hunting). Sandwiches made with Prosciutto can provide Egg Power, Sparkling Power, and Encounter Power, making it a staple for collectors and competitive team builders.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Picnic Mechanic**, where players must manually balance the ingredient on the bread to ensure the full effect of the Meal Powers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized food vendors in Paldea, most notably **Deli Cioso**, **Sure Cans**, and **Aquasalsa** outlets located in major hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or traditional held items, this is a commercially produced human food item repurposed for Pokémon bonding and training via the sandwich system.
