## Identity & Utility
**Berry Sweet** is a specialized **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A berry-shaped confection designed as a decorative catalyst for evolution. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that can be held by a Pokémon, though it serves no passive benefit in battle. While it has a defined internal cost, it is typically acquired through gameplay challenges rather than standard Poké Mart shelves.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily distributed as a reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the evolution of **Milcery** into **Alcremie**. To activate the evolution, Milcery must be holding the Berry Sweet while the player performs a "Spin" (rotating the movement stick rapidly).
* **Evolutionary Outcome:** The Berry Sweet determines the specific **decoration** on the resulting Alcremie's head. Using this item results in a **Berry Cream Alcremie** (blue berry-like ornaments). The Alcremie's body color (flavor) is determined by the duration, direction, and time of day of the spin, but the accessory is locked to this item.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no secondary effects when thrown.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The item must be consumed to evolve the Pokémon. Alcremie itself is used in competitive doubles (VGC) as a niche support Pokémon due to its signature move *Decorate*, but the Berry Sweet item is never held in a competitive match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically tied to the Milcery line. It is one of seven "Sweet" variants (alongside Strawberry, Love, Clover, Flower, Ribbon, and Star Sweets).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sword & Shield:** Primarily obtained as a random reward for defeating the Café Masters in **Battle Cafés** (located in Motostoke, Hammerlocke, and Wyndon). It can also be produced via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
    * **Scarlet & Violet:** Available in the Terarium (Blueberry Academy) via the **Item Printer** or found as sparkling pickups in the Canyon Biome.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to NPC rewards, specialized crafting, or overworld discovery.
* **Lore:** These sweets are highly prized by Milcery. The act of spinning with the sweet mimics the process of whipping cream, integrating the trainer's movement with the Pokémon's biological transformation.
