## Identity & Utility
**TM88** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A specialized data disc used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. As a Technical Machine, its usage mechanics vary by generation: it was a single-use consumable from Gen IV to Gen IV, became infinite-use from Gen V to Gen VII, and returned to being consumable (craftable/purchasable) in later titles.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). This high price point typically reflects its status as a high-tier utility or powerful setup move in the games where it is purchasable.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a Pokémon. Due to the shifting nature of TM numbering across generations, the move contained within TM88 has changed significantly:
    * **Generation IV - VI:** Teaches **Pluck** (A Flying-type physical move that consumes the target's held Berry).
    * **Generation VII:** Teaches **Sleep Talk** (Allows the user to use one of its moves while asleep).
    * **Generation VIII:** Teaches **Grassy Terrain** (Creates a terrain that heals grounded Pokémon and boosts Grass moves).
    * **Generation IX:** Teaches **Swords Dance** (Sharply raises the user's Attack stat).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Gen 9 Context:** Highly critical. **Swords Dance** is a staple setup move for physical sweepers.
        * **Gen 8 Context:** Strategic. **Grassy Terrain** is used in doubles (VGC) and specific terrain-based singles teams.
        * **Earlier Gens:** **Pluck** is primarily a playthrough move, useful for its secondary effect of stealing Berries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Interaction is limited to move-compatibility checks (not all Pokémon can learn the contents of TM88).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions (Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, etc.), TM88 is acquired through specific NPCs or purchased at major **Department Stores** (e.g., Veilstone Department Store or the Galar Battle Tower). In Generation IX, it is crafted at the **TM Machine** using Pokémon materials and LP (League Points).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured human technology designed for training.
