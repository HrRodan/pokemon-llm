## Identity & Utility
**Bug Gem** is a **Jewel (Consumable Held Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A single-use "Type-Gem" that contains an insect-like essence. It is a consumable held item designed to provide a one-time offensive burst. While it has a defined internal cost, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically found through exploration or special mechanics.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though acquisition is usually through foraging rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging **Bug-type move**, the power of that move is increased by **1.5×** (in Generation V) or **1.3×** (in Generation VI and onward). The item is consumed immediately upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** Typically **30** (Low impact; Flinging the item is inefficient as it wastes the potential damage multiplier).
    * **Competitive Use:** In Generation V, Gems were **Competitive Staples**, used to secure specific One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) against bulky threats. They are particularly synergistic with the **Unburden** ability (doubling Speed when an item is consumed) and the move **Acrobatics**, as the Gem is consumed before the move finishes, though Bug Gem specifically only boosts Bug-type attacks. 
    * **Niche Utility:** In later generations, most elemental gems (including the Bug Gem) became unavailable in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), with the Normal Gem being the primary exception.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts directly with the **Technician** ability; if the 1.5x boost brings a move's power above 60, Technician may no longer apply depending on the specific generation's calculation order.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Unova), the Bug Gem is primarily found within **Dust Clouds** inside caves. In later generations, it is often restricted to special distributions, specific Battle Resort shops, or hidden item locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly held by wild Pokémon. Most players acquire Bug Gems via environmental interaction (foraging in caves) or by using the **Pickup** ability at specific level tiers in certain games.
* **Lore:** Part of a cycle of eighteen elemental gems, these items are crystallized manifestations of type-specific energy, often found deep underground where elemental forces converge.
