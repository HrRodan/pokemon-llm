## Identity & Utility
**TM191 (Uproar)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Uproar**. In the Paldea and Kitakami regions, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at the Technical Machine Machine found at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired via exploration or the crafting system using **League Points (LP)** and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Uproar** (Normal-type, Special, 90 Power). When used, the Pokémon attacks for three consecutive turns. During this period, no Pokémon on the battlefield can fall asleep, and any currently sleeping Pokémon are immediately woken up.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Counter-Meta.** While the damage is consistent, being "locked" into the move for three turns makes the user vulnerable to resists or immunities (Ghost-types). Its primary competitive value lies in its **Anti-Sleep utility**, effectively neutralizing "Sleep Spam" strategies (e.g., Spore or Sleep Powder) from opponents.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. The move it teaches is classified as a **Sound-based move**, meaning it is blocked by the **Soundproof** ability and can be converted to Water-type by the **Liquid Voice** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC). Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked for crafting. 
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM191, a trainer typically requires:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Gastly Gas**
    * **3x Litwick Soot**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. Materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Gastly** and **Litwick** lines.
