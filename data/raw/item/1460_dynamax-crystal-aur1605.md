## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (AUR1605)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item designed for use in the Galar region's Wild Area. When taken to the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot be bought** through traditional means.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; however, this is a placeholder value as the item is strictly obtained via promotional distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (associated with the AUR1605 serial code) to appear as a Dynamax boss in a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held and functions only as an overworld encounter trigger. Its value lies in providing early or exclusive access to specific Pokémon for a playthrough or collection.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use to initiate a Raid. It is unaffected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of specific retail promotions (such as pre-order bonuses for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*). It is not available in Poké Marts or through standard gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a high-rarity promotional tool used to facilitate encounters with Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare (e.g., Larvitar or Jangmo-o lines).
