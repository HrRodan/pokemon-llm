## Identity & Utility
**Dark Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar crystalline shard that glows with a deep, dark purple hue. It represents a fragment of Terastal energy associated with the Dark type. It is a **Consumable Crafting/Service Material** that is primarily used as a currency for a specific transformation service rather than a direct-use item.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap sell value; notably, these cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts and must be farmed through gameplay).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Dark Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to **Dark**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle; it is not a held item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Priority Resource.** Changing a Pokémon's Tera Type is a cornerstone of the Gen IX competitive meta (VGC and Smogon). A Dark Tera Type is often used defensively to grant immunity to "Prankster"-boosted status moves or to flip weaknesses to Psychic and Ghost into resistances/immunities. Offensively, it is used to boost the power of Dark-type moves like Sucker Punch or Knock Off.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is strictly used for the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic. It interacts indirectly with the "Pickup" ability in certain games, though its primary source is raid rewards.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Tera Raid Battles:** Primarily obtained as a reward for defeating Dark-type Pokémon in 3-star, 4-star, 5-star, or 6-star Tera Raid Battles.
    * **Overworld:** Found as rare "sparkle" pickups on the ground throughout the Paldea region, particularly in caves or high-level areas.
    * **Item Printer:** Can be produced using the Item Printer in the Blueberry Academy's League Club Room (DLC).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is gathered through environmental exploration and combat challenges rather than traditional farming of wild encounters.
