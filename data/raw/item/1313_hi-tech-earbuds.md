## Identity & Utility
**Hi-tech Earbuds** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A pair of specialized earbuds that grant the Trainer precision control over their auditory environment. It functions as a permanent **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through a specific NPC interaction).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon acquisition, this item unlocks the **Volume Settings** within the game's Options menu. This allows the player to independently adjust the sliders for Background Music (BGM), Sound Effects (SE), and Pokémon Cries. Prior to obtaining this item, these specific audio levels are fixed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a Quality-of-Life (QoL) item intended for user interface customization and has no impact on battle mechanics, stats, or strategy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. As a Key Item, it is protected from effects like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or the *Klutz* ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, the Hi-tech Earbuds are obtained as a gift from an NPC standing near the record store in **Motostoke** (near the lift to the upper level). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind item gifted to the player to enhance the gameplay experience.
* **Context:** The inclusion of this item was a meta-commentary/gameplay choice in Generation VIII, requiring the player to "earn" the right to adjust detailed audio settings via an in-world item rather than having them unlocked by default.
