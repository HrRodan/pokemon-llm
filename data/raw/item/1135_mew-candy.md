## Identity & Utility
**Mew Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutrient packed with energy. When consumed by a Mew, it simultaneously boosts all six of its primary stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that acts as the most efficient way to maximize a Pokémon's potential in the Let's Go engine.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Specialized**). While its resale value is negligible, its functional value is high due to its rarity and specific utility.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases every stat of a **Mew** by **1 point** in the form of **Awakening Values (AVs)**. Unlike standard stat-specific candies (like Health Candy or Quick Candy), which only boost one attribute, this "Species Candy" provides a comprehensive power-up per use, up to the maximum cap of 200 AVs per stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic and held items are absent in the titles where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* ecosystem. In "No Restrictions" competitive formats within those games, Mew Candy is essential for reaching the 200 AV stat ceiling. However, it has no effect and does not exist in standard VGC or Smogon formats (which utilize the traditional EV system).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted to **Mew**. It cannot be used on any other species. It interacts with the **Awakening System**, a simplified precursor to modern stat-buffing mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item cannot be purchased at Poké Marts. It is primarily obtained by **transferring Mew** to Professor Oak or by walking with a Mew inside the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral. It serves as a reward for interacting with the Mythical Pokémon across different hardware/software (Pokémon GO and Poké Ball Plus).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As Mew is a **Mythical Pokémon**, this candy is never found in the wild and must be earned through the "Transfer to Professor" mechanic or via special events. It is most commonly gathered by players who synced their **Poké Ball Plus** to their save file.
