## Identity & Utility
**Decidium Z (Bag)** is a **Specialized Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item represents the inventory version of the Decidium Z crystal. It converts Z-Power to upgrade the move **Spirit Shackle** into a powerful, exclusive Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Item-equivalent Held Item** that cannot be consumed, traded, or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique plot-related acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Decidueye** that knows the move **Spirit Shackle**, it allows the Pokémon to execute the unique Z-Move: **Sinister Arrow Raid**. 
    * **Sinister Arrow Raid:** A physical Ghost-type move with a base power of 180.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item was a **Competitive Staple** for Decidueye during the Sun and Moon (Gen VII) era. It provided Decidueye with a high-damage "nuke" capability, allowing it to bypass Protect (dealing 25% damage) and secure KOs on bulky targets that regular Ghost-type moves could not reach.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is species-specific. It has no effect on other Pokémon and cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, nor can it be transferred via *Trick* or *Bestow*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is obtained from Hau at Malie Garden after defeating him, or gifted by him after the player becomes the Alola Champion if the player chose Rowlet as their starter. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained during the main story progression in Malie Garden.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item that cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **World Knowledge:** The "Bag" designation in the data typically refers to the permanent inventory trigger that unlocks the Z-Crystal for use in the party menu, distinguishing it from the held-item instance attached to the Pokémon.
