## Identity & Utility
**Ice Heal** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A spray-type medicine designed to treat the freezing status condition. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used both during battle to thaw a Pokémon and in the overworld menu. It is widely available for purchase at most Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly cures a single Pokémon of the **Frozen** status condition. Once used, the item is consumed and removed from the inventory.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor physical damage if thrown using the move Fling; has no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Very Low/Niche.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), manual status cures like Ice Heal are rarely used because they consume a turn. Trainers prefer the **Lum Berry** for automatic recovery or **Full Heal/Full Restore** in casual play for their versatility. In **Nuzlocke challenges**, it is a vital, low-cost insurance policy when traversing icy routes or facing Ice-type Gym Leaders.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It is categorized under "Status Cures" alongside items like Antidote, Paralyze Heal, and Awakening.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** early to mid-game. It is often found as a floor item in cold or mountainous regions (e.g., Mt. Chimney, Seafoam Islands, or Mount Lanakila).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through direct purchase or the **Pickup** ability in various titles, where it serves as a common low-level reward.
