## Identity & Utility
**TM162 (Bug Buzz)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation 9** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Bug Buzz**. In the Paldea/Terarium region, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at a TM Machine. It is an **All-Machines** category item that cannot be purchased with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; requires **10,000 League Points (LP)** and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Bug Buzz** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Bug Buzz is a powerful Special Bug-type move with **90 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Sound-Based:** As a sound-based move, Bug Buzz **bypasses Substitutes**, hitting the target directly. Pokémon with the ability *Soundproof* are immune to it.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in Gen 9, or have negligible power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Bug Buzz is the premier Special-type Bug move. It is essential for competitive Special Attackers such as **Volcarona**, **Frosmoth**, and **Ribombee** to provide STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage and coverage against Psychic, Dark, and Grass types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.
