## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Leo4357** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it activates a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal placeholder cost**; typically obtained via Serial Code or event distribution rather than bought).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area). Once used, a beam of light appears at the den, allowing the player to face a specific Pokémon (often a version-exclusive or rare encounter) in a Dynamax encounter.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld designed to facilitate encounters for catching Pokémon or gathering Raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, etc.).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is the primary method for spawning specific Raid bosses that may carry Hidden Abilities or high IVs, which are essential for building competitive teams.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts. It was distributed as a **Promotional Serial Code** (often through retail tie-ins, pre-order bonuses, or magazine distributions like CoroCoro). The "Leo" designation typically refers to a specific distribution wave or set of coordinates for the Galar region's event data.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a strictly digital-distribution item intended for use by the player character.
* **Usage Context:** In the lore of the Wild Area, these crystals react with the Power Spots of Galar to force a localized Dynamax phenomenon, bypassing the standard RNG of naturally occurring dens.
