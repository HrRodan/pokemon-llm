## Identity & Utility
**Bronze Bottle** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's picnic set. It changes the appearance of the bottle present on the picnic table during the sandwich-making mini-game. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Aesthetic** item (once purchased, it remains in the Picnic inventory) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Specialty Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the visual theme of the picnic environment. When the player sets up a picnic, the standard bottle is replaced with the Bronze Bottle, matching other bronze-themed picnic gear (like the Bronze Cup or Bronze Tablecloth).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a purely cosmetic item used for the overworld Picnic mechanic and has no impact on EVs, IVs, or combat stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic** mechanic in *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased at **Picnic Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike functional items, this must be purchased from specialized vendors to complete a player's aesthetic collection.
* **World Knowledge Context:** In the context of Generation IX's "Picnic" feature, items like the Bronze Bottle are part of a larger collectible set. While they do not affect the "Meal Powers" of sandwiches, they are used by players to personalize their social experience during local or online multiplayer sessions.
