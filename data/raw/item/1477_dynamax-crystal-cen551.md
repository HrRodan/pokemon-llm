## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Cen551)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A consumable event-specific item used to trigger a special Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it summons a specific Pokémon for a limited time. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for Sale**; this is a placeholder value as the item is distributed via external promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Gigantamax-capable Pokémon—specifically **Gigantamax Centiskorch**—to appear as a Raid Boss. The raid remains active until 23:59 of the day it was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. Its utility is strictly for acquisition, allowing players to capture a Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or the Gigantamax Factor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It does not trigger evolution but provides access to a Pokémon that would otherwise require high-density Wishing Piece farming or specific event windows.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **promotional serial code** through retailers (such as GameStop or Centra) to celebrate specific events or expansions. It is not available in Poké Marts or found through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital "key" used to unlock a localized encounter. In the context of the Galar region’s lore, these crystals are concentrated fragments of Galar Particles used to force a Dynamax projection at a dormant Power Spot.
