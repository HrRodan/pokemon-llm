## Identity & Utility
**Steelium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This specialized crystal converts Z-Power to upgrade Steel-type moves into powerful Steel-type Z-Moves. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Item** that remains in the player's Z-Crystal bag; it is not consumed upon use but must be held by a Pokémon to function in battle. It **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a Steel-type move, it allows the use of the Z-Move **Corkscrew Crash**. 
    * If the base move is an **attacking move**, Corkscrew Crash deals massive damage based on the power of the original move.
    * If the base move is a **status move**, it activates a **Z-Status effect** (e.g., Z-Iron Defense resets lowered stats, Z-Autotomize resets lowered stats) in addition to the move's normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Generation VII Specific).** Steelium Z was a cornerstone of the Gen VII competitive meta (VGC and Smogon SM). It provided Steel-type attackers like **Kartana**, **Metagross**, and **Excadrill** a high-accuracy, high-power nuke to bypass defensive checks or eliminate Fairy-type threats instantly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Z-Move Requirement:** The Pokémon must have a Steel-type move in its active moveset to trigger the crystal.
    * **Embargo/Magic Room:** This item is unaffected by moves or abilities that prevent item use, such as Knock Off, Thief, or Sticky Hold; it cannot be removed from the holder during battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the Steelium Z is obtained from **Molayne** at Mount Hokulani after the player completes the trial of Sophocles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact tied to the Alolan trial system.
* **Lore Context:** Z-Crystals are crystallized manifestations of Z-Power, legendary energy originating from Necrozma. The Steelium Z specifically resonates with the rigid and durable properties of the Steel type.
