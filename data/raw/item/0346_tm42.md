## Identity & Utility
**TM42** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** categorized under **All-Machines**, introduced in **Generation III**.
*   **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon a specific move that it might not learn through leveling up. While its contents have shifted across the series' history, it is most famously associated with the move **Facade**. It is a **Consumable** item (in most generations) that **Can** be bought.
*   **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Facade** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    *   *Note on Historical Variation:* While primarily Facade, in *Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee*, this TM teaches **Self-Destruct**. In Generations I and II, the move was **Dream Eater**. 
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **High (Competitive Staple).** Facade is a critical move in competitive play, particularly for Pokémon with the **Guts** ability (e.g., Ursaluna, Conkeldurr, Swellow). It allows a Pokémon to turn a debilitating status condition (Burn, Paralysis, or Poison) into a massive offensive advantage by doubling the move's base power from 70 to 140.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a vital tool for "Status Orb" sets (Flame Orb/Toxic Orb) to maximize damage output.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Frequently available for purchase at major Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove) or awarded by Gym Leaders. In the Hoenn region, it is traditionally gifted by **Gym Leader Norman** after the player defeats him, symbolizing the "strength found through endurance."
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be found as overworld loot, purchased, or received as a reward from NPCs.
*   **Regional Context:** As a "Machine," it represents the technological side of Pokémon training, allowing trainers to customize their team's movesets beyond natural biological limits.
