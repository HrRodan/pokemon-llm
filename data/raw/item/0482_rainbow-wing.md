## Identity & Utility
**Rainbow-wing** is a **Plot-advancement Key Item** introduced in Generation II (and featured prominently in the Generation IV Johto remakes).
* **Description:** A mystical, rainbow-colored feather that sparkles with an ethereal light. As a Key Item, it is categorized for plot advancement and cannot be consumed, sold, or held by Pokémon in a competitive capacity.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique quest item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Rainbow Wing serves as the essential catalyst to encounter the Legendary Pokémon **Ho-Oh**. When the player reaches the roof of the **Bell Tower** (Tin Tower) in the Johto region with this item in their Bag, it reacts to the environment, causing Ho-Oh to descend for a battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and legendary encounters within the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is a "trigger" item, meaning its presence in the inventory unlocks scripted game events. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquisition is dependent on the version of the game:
    * **Pokémon Gold/HeartGold:** Obtained after defeating Team Rocket at the Goldenrod Radio Tower (given by the Radio Director). It is required to progress to the Johto League.
    * **Pokémon Silver/SoulSilver:** Obtained from an elderly man in **Pewter City** (Kanto) during the post-game, allowing the player to catch the opposite version's mascot.
    * **Pokémon Crystal:** Obtained after catching all three Legendary Beasts (Raikou, Entei, and Suicune).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact tied to the lore of the "Tower Duo" and the history of Ecruteak City.
