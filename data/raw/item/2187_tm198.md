## Identity & Utility
**TM198** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Pounce**. In the Paldea and Kitakami regions, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at any Pokémon Center's TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using 800 League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Pounce** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Pounce is a Physical Bug-type move with 50 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. 
    * **Secondary Effect:** It is guaranteed to lower the target's **Speed** stat by one stage upon a successful hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Early-game.** While the guaranteed Speed drop is useful for speed control, Pounce is often overlooked in high-level competitive play (VGC/Smogon) in favor of more powerful Bug-type moves like *U-turn* (for pivoting) or *First Impression* (for priority). It sees the most utility in "Nuzlocke" runs or mid-game playthroughs where speed control is vital.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be remade indefinitely if the player has the necessary materials.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item on the ground in the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC). Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked at the TM Machine.
