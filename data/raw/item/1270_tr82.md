## Identity & Utility
**TR82 (Stored Power)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use instruction manual used to teach the move **Stored Power** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, TRs are **consumable** and break after one use. It represents a specialized tier of powerful moves that must be farmed or purchased.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard acquisition cost).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the Move **Stored Power** (Psychic-type, Special). The move starts with a base power of 20, which increases by 20 for every positive stat stage the user has currently active (e.g., +2 Special Attack and +1 Speed results in a 80-power move).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low impact; generally not recommended for Fling-based strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** This item is essential for "Setup Sweepers" and bulky win-conditions. It is a core component of strategies involving moves like *Calm Mind*, *Cosmic Power*, or *Shell Smash*. It is particularly devastating on Pokémon with the **Simple** ability or those behind **Aurora Veil/Screens**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Teaching this move does not trigger any known evolutions, but it is the primary offensive tool for Pokémon such as **Hatterene**, **Reuniclus**, and **Calyrex-Shadow**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Galar Wild Area**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** for Watts (W) or received as a reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Psychic-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an artificial technical device distributed through Galar's raid economy.
