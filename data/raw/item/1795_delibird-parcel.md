## Identity & Utility
**Delibird Parcel** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a material dropped by or taken from a Delibird. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly from the bag to affect a Pokémon's stats or health. Instead, it serves as a specialized currency for the Technical Machine Machine (TMM).
* **Cost:** 240 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a sell value, its primary worth lies in its utility as a crafting component.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers to craft various Technical Machines (TMs). It is consumed along with League Points (LP) to create specific moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling in a meaningful way; typically results in standard low-priority damage if applicable, but generally lacks a secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in battle. Its value is entirely "meta-competitive," as it is required to obtain powerful TMs (such as **TM034 Icy Wind** or **TM060 U-turn**) used to optimize competitive movepools.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Generation IX material economy and does not interact with abilities like Pickup in the traditional sense, as it is a guaranteed drop rather than a held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Delibird**. It is most commonly farmed in the snowy regions of the Paldea region (Glaseado Mountain).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not categorized as a "Held Item" in the traditional sense (it does not appear in the held item slot), it is a **guaranteed drop** from the Delibird evolutionary line upon their defeat in the wild.
* **Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, these parcels are treated as shed or lost items from Delibird, which are then repurposed by trainers to encode move data into TMs.
