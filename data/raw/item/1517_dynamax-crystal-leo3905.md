## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Leo3905** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears as a Dynamax encounter until the end of the day. This is a **Consumable Event Item** that technically has a cost but is not found in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Cheap; essentially Not for Sale via standard gameplay).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an otherwise inactive Pokémon Den in the Galar Wild Area), it generates a red beam that triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. In the case of the **Leo3905** variant, this crystal specifically summons **Larvitar**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly. However, it is highly valuable for competitive players as it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon (Larvitar) that may otherwise be version-exclusive (Larvitar is usually exclusive to *Pokémon Shield*), allowing *Pokémon Sword* players to catch it with their own Trainer ID.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but the Larvitar caught from this raid can be evolved into the pseudo-legendary Tyranitar, a perennial competitive staple.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **Promotional Item** not available through normal exploration. These crystals were primarily distributed via **Serial Codes** provided to players who purchased the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack* or through specific retail distributions (such as GameStop or Target events).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a special distribution item, often found in the "Other Items" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag depending on the specific game version, though it functions similarly to a Key Item for a one-time event.
