## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Ori1790** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item used to trigger specific Max Raid Battles. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon to appear as a raid boss. It is a **Consumable** item that is functionally a "Special Acquisition" and **cannot** be bought in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Symbolic; typically distributed via serial codes rather than purchased).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (Watchtower Ruins) causes a specific Dynamax Pokémon to manifest in the den. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for PvE (Player vs. Environment) encounters. It is used to secure specific Pokémon, often those with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax potential, which can then be trained for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through standard gameplay or Poké Marts. It was distributed as a **Promotional Event Item** (often via serial codes from retailers like GameStop, Target, or as pre-order bonuses for the Sword & Shield Expansion Pass). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital distribution item intended for one-time use to guarantee a rare encounter for the player and their invited raid partners.
