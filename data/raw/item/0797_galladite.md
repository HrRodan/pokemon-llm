## Identity & Utility
**Galladite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*, though categorized under Generation VII in recent data sets).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed for a single species. When held by a Gallade, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically a unique or event-based acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the player possesses a Mega Bracelet (or Z-Ring) and a Gallade holds this stone, the Gallade can Mega Evolve into **Mega Gallade**. This transformation increases its base stats (primarily Attack, Defense, and Speed) and changes its Ability to **Inner Focus**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: Using Fling will consume the item and prevent Mega Evolution for the remainder of the battle; this is generally considered a tactical error).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as Gen 6/7 Smogon tiers or VGC), Galladite is mandatory for utilizing Mega Gallade, a powerful Physical Sweeper.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Exclusivity:** This item only functions for **Gallade**. It has no effect when held by Gardevoir or any other Pokémon.
    * **Protection:** As a Mega Stone, it cannot be removed from the holder by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*, nor can it be traded via *Trick* if held by the correct Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a post-game reward. 
    * In *Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire*, it is gifted by Professor Cozmo after the Delta Episode.
    * In *Sun/Moon*, it was originally an event-only item, later made available at the **Battle Tree** for BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
