## Identity & Utility
**Eevium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (Species-Specific) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically tuned to the DNA of Eevee. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that cannot be sold, traded, or consumed. Like all Z-Crystals, it is immune to item-removal mechanics such as *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique key item acquired through a specific side-quest.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Eevee** that knows the move **Last Resort**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Extreme Evoboost**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Extreme Evoboost Mechanics:** Unlike most offensive Z-Moves, this is a status-based Z-Move. Upon use, it increases Eevee's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats by **two stages (+2)** each.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used as a "win condition" or "setup sweeper" strategy. In Generation VII competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), the standard strategy involved using Extreme Evoboost and then using **Baton Pass** to transfer the massive +2 stat omni-boosts to a more powerful teammate. It is considered a high-risk, high-reward niche item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It only functions if the holder is Eevee; it has no effect on Eevee's "Eeveelutions" (e.g., Vaporeon, Jolteon).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained by completing the **Eevee Users side-quest**. After becoming the Champion, the player must speak to Kagetora at the Thrifty Megamart (Royal Avenue) and subsequently defeat eight Eevee trainers located across the Alola region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item tied to the player's progress and cannot be farmed or duplicated via the **Pickup** ability.
