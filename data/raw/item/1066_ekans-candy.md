## Identity & Utility
**Ekans Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable candy packed with energy. Unlike standard Stat Candies (which target a single stat), this species-specific variant is designed to be given to the **Ekans** evolutionary line (Ekans and Arbok). It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased for a nominal fee but is primarily acquired through gameplay loops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by an Ekans or Arbok, it increases **all six of their stats simultaneously** by +1 (specifically increasing their Awakening Values, or AVs). This allows a Pokémon to reach its maximum potential much faster than using generic candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic and held items are absent in the *Let's Go* series).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** In the context of the *Let's Go* competitive meta, maximizing AVs via species candies is mandatory for "No Restrictions" battles. However, this item does not exist in the core series (Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet) or standard Smogon/VGC formats, as the AV system was replaced by the traditional EV (Effort Value) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement within the **Ekans and Arbok** family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Let's Go versions) by catching large quantities of wild Ekans or by transferring Ekans to Professor Oak. It can also be found as a reward for walking an Ekans in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via the **Catch Combo** mechanic or by "grinding" caught specimens into candy at the laboratory. In the context of the economy, the 20 Poké Dollar cost is a base value, but these items are rarely "bought" in bulk from a standard Mart; they are earned through the "transfer" loop.
