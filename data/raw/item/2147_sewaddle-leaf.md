## Identity & Utility
**Sewaddle Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting reagent dropped by members of the Sewaddle evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that is primarily utilized at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to create specific move-teaching items. In the context of *Scarlet & Violet*, it is specifically required to craft TMs such as **TM182 (Bug Bite)** and **TM185 (Lunge)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no held-item utility or direct impact on battle mechanics; its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a direct byproduct of the **Sewaddle, Swadloon, and Leavanny** evolutionary line. It cannot be used as a medicine or a traditional held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild Sewaddle, Swadloon, or Leavanny. In the Paldea region's DLC (The Teal Mask/The Indigo Disk), these materials are frequently farmed in grassy habitats where the Sewaddle line resides.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a traditional held item but is dropped automatically upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is a common resource for trainers looking to optimize Bug-type move coverage for their team.
