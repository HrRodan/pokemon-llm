## Identity & Utility
**Bead Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A stationary item designed to be held by a Pokémon to facilitate social messaging between Trainers during trades. It features a unique visual design that displays the "print" (icon/sprite) of the Pokémon holding it. It is a **Consumable/Held** item that can be purchased at various Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a pre-defined list of words and phrases. Once the message is written and the Mail is given to a Pokémon, it can be sent to another player via trade. The recipient can read the message, erase it to reuse the item, or store it in the PC’s Mailbox.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with Fling in the generations where they are functional).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** While intended for messaging, Mail items have a unique secondary mechanic: a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot** have its item removed or swapped by moves like *Trick*, *Thief*, *Knock Off*, or *Switcheroo*. However, because it provides no stat boosts or recovery, it is almost never used in serious competitive play outside of very specific "item-theft" denial strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Locking:** A Pokémon holding Bead Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system. This is a technical safeguard to ensure the message data attached to the item remains accessible in the party.
    * **Abilities:** This item is unaffected by most item-manipulation abilities because it is "locked" to the holder.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available in Poké Marts across the Hoenn and Kanto (FRLG) regions. In later generations, Mail items were gradually phased out and are often unavailable for purchase or have been removed from the game's functional item list (becoming "vendor trash" or flavor items).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon; it must be purchased and assigned by the Trainer. It is not part of the **Pickup** ability loot table.
