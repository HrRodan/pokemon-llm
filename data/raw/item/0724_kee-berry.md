## Identity & Utility
**Kee Berry** is a **Consumable Berry** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized defensive berry that reacts to physical impact. It is a consumable held item that is typically acquired through berry mutation or specialized planting rather than direct purchase.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though primarily obtained through cultivation).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a **physical move**, the Kee Berry is consumed to increase the holder's **Defense by one stage** (+1 Def). It triggers after the damage is dealt.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Consuming the berry via Fling will trigger the +1 Defense boost on the target).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fairy-type** move with **100 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a niche but powerful competitive item. It is frequently paired with the ability **Unburden** (e.g., on Drifblim or Hawlucha) to simultaneously boost Defense and double Speed upon being hit. It is also a staple for **Harvest** users (like Trevenant or Alolan Exeggutor) to repeatedly cycle Defense boosts against physical attackers. In VGC and Smogon, it is often seen on "Setup Sweepers" who use the Defense boost to survive long enough to capitalize on moves like Calm Mind or Bulk Up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles the Defense boost to +2) and **Cheek Pouch** (restores HP upon consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Generation VI), it could only be obtained via **Berry Mutation** by planting a Liechi Berry and a Ganlon Berry next to each other. In later generations, it is often found in specialized berry piles or as a reward for high-level battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is considered a "cultivated" berry that requires player intervention or specific environmental foraging to obtain.
