## Identity & Utility
**Soul Dew** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A wondrous, crystalline orb designed specifically for the Eon Duo, Latios and Latias. It is a legendary held item that cannot be purchased through normal means; its presence usually signifies a high-tier legendary encounter or a special event.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique or event-driven acquisition, often treated with the rarity of a Key Item despite being holdable.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The mechanics of Soul Dew vary significantly based on the game generation:
    * **Generations III–VI:** While held by Latias or Latios, it increases their **Special Attack and Special Defense by 50%**. This massive stat multiplier effectively gives the holder the equivalent of a Calm Mind boost permanently.
    * **Generation VII–Present:** The item was nerfed to provide a **20% power boost to Psychic- and Dragon-type moves** when held by Latios or Latias (similar to a Type-enhancing item like Mystic Water, but for two types).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low utility for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically, Soul Dew was **banned** from almost every official competitive format (VGC, Battle Tower, and Smogon’s standard tiers) during Gens 3–6 because the 1.5x stat boosts made Latios and Latias overwhelmingly powerful. In modern generations, it is generally permitted but less dominant due to the mechanical nerf to move-power boosting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It specifically checks the holder's internal ID to ensure only Latios (Species #381) or Latias (Species #380) benefit from the effects.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Soul Dew is typically found in locations associated with the Eon Duo, such as **Southern Island** (Hoenn) or given by NPCs in post-game areas (e.g., Aether House in Alola or Wyndon in Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is **not found** on wild Pokémon. In its debut, it was only obtainable via the Enigma Stone event or the Eon Ticket.
* **Lore context:** Within Pokémon lore (specifically the 5th movie, *Pokémon Heroes*), the Soul Dew is said to contain the essence of a Latios that sacrificed itself to protect the city of Altomare. It is a focal point of power for the Eon Duo.
