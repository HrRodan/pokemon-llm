## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CRV4623)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, single-use event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It functions as a beacon to force a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Restricted**; effectively not for sale as it is distributed via special promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Corviknight**. The raid remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate rare encounters. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors which are highly relevant in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed as a promotional bonus (often via serial codes from retailers like GameStop or through official Pokémon publications). It is not available at Poké Marts or through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item tied to the "CRV" (Crystal Raid) series of event encounters.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals like the CRV4623 were designed to give players early access to Gigantamax forms or rare Hidden Ability Pokémon that were otherwise difficult to find in the early weeks of *Sword and Shield's* release.
