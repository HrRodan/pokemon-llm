## Identity & Utility
**Autograph** is a **Key Item / Souvenir** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A personalized note from the Vermilion City Gym Leader, Lt. Surge, featuring the message “Good luck!” It is a **Key Item** that is non-consumable and resides in the player's Bag as a memento of victory.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). As a unique story item, it cannot be bought or sold at Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Autograph serves no functional purpose in terms of gameplay mechanics, healing, or evolution. It acts as a **souvenir or trophy**, signifying the player's progression and their victory over the third Kanto Gym Leader.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battle format. It exists solely for the single-player narrative experience.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate the evolution of any Pokémon and has no interaction with abilities such as Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is unique to the *Let's Go* series. It is obtained as a gift from **Lt. Surge** in the Vermilion Gym after the player defeats him and receives the Thunder Badge.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a fixed event item tied to story progression.
* **Lore Context:** Unlike most Gym Leaders who only provide a Badge and a TM, Lt. Surge’s gift of an autograph adds flavor to his "Lightning American" persona, portraying him as a local celebrity or a mentor figure acknowledging the player's potential. Although categorized as "unused" in internal data structures due to its lack of a secondary script, it remains a permanent part of the player's inventory.
