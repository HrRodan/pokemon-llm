## Identity & Utility
**Exp. Candy L** is a **Growth Consumable (Vitamin)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A large, energy-packed candy used to instantly grant a Pokémon a significant amount of Experience Points. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that functions as a high-tier alternative to Rare Candies, allowing for more precise level management. While it has a listed cost, it is primarily an earned reward rather than a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive, though generally not available for direct purchase in most markets).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed from the bag, it grants a single Pokémon exactly **10,000 Experience Points**. 
* **Hierarchy Context:** It sits in the upper-mid tier of the Exp. Candy family:
    * Exp. Candy S (800 EXP) < Exp. Candy M (3,000 EXP) < **Exp. Candy L (10,000 EXP)** < Exp. Candy XL (30,000 EXP).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no utility *during* a battle, it is a **Competitive Staple** for preparation. It is used by trainers to rapidly elevate Pokémon to Level 50 (the standard for VGC/Battle Stadium) or Level 100 (required for Hyper Training).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates evolution for any Pokémon that evolves via leveling up (e.g., reaching level 32 for starter evolutions). Unlike the Rare Candy, it can provide multiple levels at once if the Pokémon's XP threshold is low.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** (Sword/Shield) and **Tera Raid Battles** (Scarlet/Violet), specifically from 4-star and 5-star encounters. It can also be obtained through the Cram-o-matic or as a reward in the Battle Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly tied to raid boss victories or specific NPC rewards, making it a reward for high-level PvE content rather than foraging.
