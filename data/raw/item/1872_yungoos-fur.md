## Identity & Utility
**Yungoos Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clump of fur dropped by the Yungoos evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that serves as a specialized currency for the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. It is not intended for direct use in battle or on a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, it is combined with League Points (LP) to create moves such as **TM011 (Water Pulse)** and **TM018 (Thief)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard TM materials cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no tactical value in competitive play (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held or used during a match. Its importance is strictly limited to the preparation and teambuilding phase (Move Acquisition).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine economy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Yungoos line. It is found early in the Paldea region (South Province, Inlet Grotto).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item, but rather a guaranteed or high-probability **drop** from wild **Yungoos** and **Gumshoos**. Players typically farm this material in early-game routes to unlock utility moves for their team.
