## Identity & Utility
**TM65 (Shadow Claw)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Shadow Claw**, a physical Ghost-type attack. As a Technical Machine, its usage has evolved through the series: it was a single-use consumable in Gen 4, became infinite-use from Gen 5 through Gen 8, and returned to a consumable (often craftable) format in Gen 9.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the base cost is listed at 1,000, its value in later generations varies depending on whether it is purchased at a Department Store or crafted using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Shadow Claw** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Shadow Claw is a Physical Ghost-type move with **70 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. 
    * **Special Property:** It possesses an **increased critical-hit ratio** (Stage 1), making it more likely to bypass an opponent's defensive boosts.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Physical Coverage.** Shadow Claw is a staple for physical attackers (like Mimikyu, Aegislash, or Garchimp) that lack access to more powerful physical Ghost moves like *Poltergeist* or *Phantom Force*. Its high critical-hit rate makes it particularly effective on Pokémon with the **Super Luck** ability or those holding a **Scope Lens**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, primarily those with "claw" or "sharp" motifs, extending beyond Ghost-types to many Normal, Dragon, and Ground-types seeking type coverage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In its debut (**Diamond/Pearl/Platinum**), it is found in the **Wayward Cave**, requiring Flash to navigate. 
    * In later generations, it is frequently available for purchase at **Department Stores** (such as the Veilstone or Konikoni City stores) or found in mid-to-late game dungeons.
    * In **Scarlet/Violet**, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using **3x Mimikyu Scrap** and **3x Komala Claw**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an artificial tool developed by Silph Co. or similar regional corporations for Pokémon training.
