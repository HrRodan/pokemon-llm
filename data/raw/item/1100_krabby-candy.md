## Identity & Utility
**Krabby Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. When fed to specific Pokémon (Krabby or Kingler), it simultaneously increases all of their stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought or sold for a very low price, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay loops rather than traditional retail.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases all six stats of a Krabby or Kingler by **1 Awakening Value (AV)** point. Unlike standard Rare Candies that increase level, or Vitamins that target single stats, this item provides a comprehensive boost across the entire stat spread.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* mechanics. It is essential for "Master Trainer" battles and endgame optimization within that specific engine, as AVs function as the replacement for the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is explicitly restricted to the **Krabby evolutionary line**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Let's Go series) by **transferring Krabby to Professor Oak**, achieving high **Catch Combos** of wild Krabby, or by walking with a Krabby inside the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer for demonstrating proficiency in catching or via the **Pickup** mechanic in certain contextual environments.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of *Let's Go*, Species Candies are the most efficient way to maximize a Pokémon's potential, as they bypass the tier restrictions of generic candies (Quick Candy, Tough Candy, etc.) and provide the maximum AV cap (+200 to every stat).
