## Identity & Utility
**Numel Lava** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed or produced by members of the Numel evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon to gain a passive effect. It is primarily managed via the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars / League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its use as a reagent for the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is combined with League Points (LP) to create TMs that teach various moves to Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the material itself has no competitive function, it is mandatory for crafting high-tier competitive TMs such as **TM133 (Earth Power)** and **TM165 (Flare Blitz)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the Generation IX crafting sub-system. It is not affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a standard battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea** region (and potentially other Gen IX areas like Kitakami or the Terarium). It is awarded to the player after defeating or catching wild members of the Numel family.
* **Wild Drop Source:** Dropped by wild **Numel** and **Camerupt**. 
    * Typically, Numel can be found in rocky areas and olive groves early-to-mid game.
    * Unlike "Held Items," these are modern "Drops" that are automatically added to the inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter, making them significantly easier to farm in bulk via the "Let's Go!" Auto-Battle feature.
