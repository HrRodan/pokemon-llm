## Identity & Utility
**Pass-orb** is a **Held Item** (Special Currency) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious orb that channels the energy of the Unova region. While categorized mechanically as a held item, it serves primarily as a specialized currency for the **Entralink** feature. It is a **Consumable Utility** item used to fuel the activation of Pass Powers.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**). While it has a defined internal cost, it is rarely traded for currency, as its value lies in its unique mechanical function.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as the required currency to activate **Pass Powers** within the Entralink. These powers provide a wide range of temporary benefits, such as increasing Experience Point gains, boosting catch rates, or lowering shop prices for a limited duration.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The Pass-orb provides no tactical advantage in standard competitive play (Smogon/VGC). Its utility is strictly restricted to overworld progression, grinding efficiency, and multiplayer missions in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of the few items categorized as "held" that is technically held by the player (in a dedicated bag slot) rather than by a Pokémon for a combat benefit.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through participating in missions within the **Entralink**. In *Black 2 and White 2*, they are also found lying on the ground in the Entralink's version of the Unova region or rewarded for completing "Funfest Missions."
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike items like the Everstone or Leppa Berry, Pass-orbs cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild species; they must be earned through the Unova region's unique wireless connectivity features.
* **Lore context:** The orb is said to contain the "power of the Unova region," representing the connection between players in the Entralink (the physical manifestation of the wireless "World of Dreams" or "Hollow" in the center of Unova).
