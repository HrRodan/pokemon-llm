## Effect & Mechanics

    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic overworld item. It does not affect a Pokémon's stats, moves, or abilities in a competitive environment.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX "Picnic Knacks" collection used to personalize the player's campsite.

* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a specialized outdoor goods item intended for trainer use during the Sandwich-making mini-game.
