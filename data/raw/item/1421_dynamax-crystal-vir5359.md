## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (VIR5359)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-Exclusive Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to spawn. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Functional Zero/Not for sale**). While the internal data lists a nominal cost, these items are distributed via serial codes and cannot be bought in Marts or sold for profit.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player stands before the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), using this item causes a specific Raid Boss—designated by the internal code **VIR5359**—to appear. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for acquisition only. However, the Pokémon caught through these crystals often possess Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), or Gigantamax factors, making them highly valuable for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the Raid Den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Distribution Only.** Dynamax Crystals with "VIR" prefixes were typically distributed via serial codes through retailers (such as GameStop or GAME) or as pre-order bonuses. They are not found within the standard game world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. This is a digital-only promotional item tied to the Galar region's Max Raid mechanic.
* **Context:** These crystals were a primary way for The Pokémon Company to distribute "Gigantamax" encounters or Version-Exclusive Pokémon to players regardless of their specific game version (*Sword* or *Shield*).
