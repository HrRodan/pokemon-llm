## Identity & Utility
**HM08** is a **Hidden Machine (HM)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** As an HM, it is a reusable device used to teach a permanent move to compatible Pokémon. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in earlier generations, HMs are not consumed upon use. However, moves learned via HM08 typically cannot be forgotten unless the player visits a Move Deleter. It is a **Key Utility Item** that is required for story progression and overworld navigation.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique item obtained through specific story events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The move taught by HM08 varies depending on the region and generation:
    * **Generation III & VI (Hoenn):** Teaches **Dive**. This allows the player to travel underwater in deep patches of the ocean to access sub-surface caves and trenches.
    * **Generation IV & VIII (Sinnoh/Johto):** Teaches **Rock Climb**. This allows the player to scale specific textured rocky walls to reach higher elevations or hidden items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (HMs are generally restricted from being held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Dive (Gen III/VI):** A two-turn Water-type move. It is rarely used in high-level competitive play due to its predictability, though it can be used to stall out turns of weather or opponent's protection.
        * **Rock Climb (Gen IV/VIII):** A Normal-type physical attack with a 20% chance to confuse the target. It saw niche play on Pokémon with the **Sheer Force** ability (like Tauros or Druddigon) to boost its power and negate the confusion chance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for move-learning. It cannot be used on Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability in battle, but Klutz does not prevent the teaching of the move.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** HM08 is always provided as a gift or found at a critical junction in the journey:
    * **Hoenn:** Given by **Steven Stone** in Mossdeep City after defeating the Gym Leaders Tate and Liza (or after the Space Center event).
    * **Sinnoh:** Found as an item ball in the blizzard on **Route 217**, near a Hiker's house.
    * **Johto (HGSS):** Given by **Professor Oak** after the player earns all 16 badges and defeats Blue.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique "Key" item found once per save file in traditional games. In modern iterations like *Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl*, the HM data is loaded into the Pokétch rather than occupying a permanent inventory slot for a single Pokémon.
