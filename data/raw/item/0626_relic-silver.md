## Identity & Utility
**Relic Silver** is a **Loot/Treasure item** introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** An ancient silver coin used by a civilization roughly 3,000 years ago. It serves as a high-value trade item designed specifically to be sold to specialized collectors. It is a **Consumable (Vendor Trash)** item that **cannot be bought** from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has no purchase price, it possesses a high resale value.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its sole functional purpose is to be sold for profit. In its debut games (*Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*), it can be sold to the **Item Maniac** (the billionaire's son in Undella Town) for **5,000 Poké Dollars**, which is significantly higher than what a standard shop would offer.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages in battle and is strictly used for wealth accumulation during a playthrough.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is part of the "Relic" set of items (including Relic Gold, Copper, Vase, Band, Statue, and Crown) found within the Abyssal Ruins.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found as hidden treasure within the **Abyssal Ruins** in the Unova region. It represents the historical currency of the ancient kingdom that once inhabited the area.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered via overworld exploration or by using the **Dowsing Machine** in specific historical sites.
* **Lore Context:** The Relic Silver is a key piece of Unova’s world-building, hinting at the 3,000-year-old history of the region and the king associated with the Abyssal Ruins. Collectors (Maniacs) value it as a rare archaeological find rather than a functional tool.
