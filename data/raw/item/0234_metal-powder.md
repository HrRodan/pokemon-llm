## Identity & Utility
**Metal Powder** is a **Species-Specific** held item introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** An extremely fine, rigid powder designed specifically for **Ditto**. It is a **Held Item** that serves as a specialized defensive augment. While it has a listed cost, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts and is typically acquired through specialized means.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Specialized).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Ditto**, it increases the holder’s **Defense** and **Special Defense** stats by **50% (1.5x)**. 
* **Mechanic Constraint:** This defensive boost is only active while Ditto is in its original form. The bonus is **lost immediately** once Ditto uses the move Transform or switches into a target via the Imposter ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Obsolete.** In modern competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), Ditto almost exclusively uses the ability **Imposter** to transform instantly upon entering the field. Since Metal Powder’s effect vanishes after transformation, it provides no benefit to Imposter sets. It is technically usable on a **Limber** Ditto to increase survivability for the single turn required to manually use Transform, but it is vastly outclassed by **Choice Scarf** or **Focus Sash**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of two items specific to Ditto (the other being the Quick Powder, which boosts Speed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally not available for purchase in standard shops. It is primarily obtained as a held item on wild encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently found on wild **Ditto** (typically a 5% or 50% chance depending on the specific game version). Trainers often farm this item using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet**.
* **Lore context:** The powder is described as being "fine yet hard," suggesting it acts as a physical reinforcement for Ditto's otherwise gelatinous and vulnerable cellular structure before it can mimic a stronger foe.
