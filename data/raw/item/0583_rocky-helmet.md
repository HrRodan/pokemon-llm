## Identity & Utility
**Rocky Helmet** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that acts as a defensive deterrent. If the holder is struck by an opponent's move that makes physical contact, the attacker is penalized with recoil damage. It is a **Held Item** that is generally available for purchase in late-game shops or Battle Facilities.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range; moderately expensive but accessible for competitive preparation).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a move that makes **contact**, the attacking Pokémon loses **1/6 (approx. 16.6%)** of its maximum HP. This effect triggers on every hit of a multi-hit move (e.g., Scale Shot or Surging Strikes), making it devastating against such attackers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Base physical damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Tier 1 Competitive Staple.** It is the premier choice for defensive pivots and "walls" (e.g., Corviknight, Toxapex, Ferrothorn, and Skarmory). It is specifically used to punish physical attackers, chip away at "U-turn" users, and discourage the use of "Rapid Spin."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It has powerful synergy with damage-reflecting abilities like **Rough Skin** (Garchomp) and **Iron Barbs** (Ferrothorn), where the combined damage can strip nearly 30% of an attacker's HP in a single contact. It is countered by the item **Protective Pads** or the ability **Magic Guard**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in the overworld during the mid-to-late game (e.g., Cold Storage in Unova, Route 18 in Kalos). In modern titles, it is frequently sold at the **Delibird Presents** or via **Battle Points (BP)** vendors in post-game facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly held by wild Pokémon, making it a "special acquisition" item usually gathered through exploration or high-end retail rather than farming. In some generations, it can be obtained via the **Pickup** ability at high levels (Level 81-100).
