## Identity & Utility
**Mewnium Z** is a Species-Specific Z-Crystal introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item converts Z-Power to allow the Pokémon **Mew** to upgrade its move "Psychic" into a specialized, high-powered Z-Move. It is a permanent, non-consumable held item that acts as a Key Item within the bag. It cannot be sold or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through special events or specific NPC triggers).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Mew that knows the move **Psychic**, it allows the use of the exclusive Z-Move: **Genesis Supernova**.
    * **Genesis Supernova Power:** 185 (Special).
    * **Secondary Terrain Effect:** Upon successful execution, Genesis Supernova automatically creates **Psychic Terrain** on the battlefield for five turns (or eight if the user were holding Terrain Extender, though Mew cannot hold both).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Item Protection:** Z-Crystals are immune to the effects of **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Covet**, **Trick**, and **Switcheroo**. They cannot be removed or stolen from the holder.
    * **Competitive Use:** While Mew has many viable sets due to its versatile stats, Mewnium Z is a powerful offensive tool. It is unique among Z-moves because it sets its own terrain, boosting further Psychic-type attacks and protecting Mew from priority moves like Sucker Punch or Extreme Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It specifically requires the move **Psychic** to function; it will not work with other Psychic-type moves like Psyshock.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Pokémon Sun and Moon**, this item was originally distributed via an internet mystery gift for users of the *Pokémon Bank*.
    * In **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**, it can be obtained in-game at the **Tide Song Hotel** in Heahea City. An NPC (the man in the room with the Pikachu) will provide the crystal if the player has a Mew in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact tied to the lore of Mew’s genetic potential interacting with Alolan Z-Power.
