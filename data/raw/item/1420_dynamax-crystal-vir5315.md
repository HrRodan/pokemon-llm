## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (vir5315)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon remains available for challenge until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder Value**). While assigned a nominal cost in the game data, it is not obtainable in Marts and is functionally priceless as an event distribution.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it beam-summons a specific Gigantamax-capable Pokémon. Based on the "vir5315" designation, this crystal specifically triggers an encounter with **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** Its primary value is providing a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon possessing the **G-Max Factor**. In the competitive VGC or Smogon formats, this item is used during the "team building" phase to acquire a Sandaconda with optimal IVs/Abilities for its unique G-Max move, *G-Max Sandblast*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item is consumed upon use. It does not evolve Pokémon but serves as the only way to "spawn" certain Gigantamax encounters outside of rare Den RNG or the Max Soup mechanic introduced in the Isle of Armor DLC.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** as part of a limited-time promotional event (typically through retailers like GAME in the UK or GameStop in the US). It is not available through regular exploration or Marts. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "special gift" and is often managed within the "Other Items" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag depending on the specific version's inventory sorting.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike the naturally occurring beams in the Wild Area, these crystals allow a Trainer to "force" a localized Dynamax phenomenon, effectively acting as a beacon for a specific powerful entity.
