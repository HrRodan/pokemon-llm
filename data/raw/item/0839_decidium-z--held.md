## Identity & Utility
**Decidium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola Region).
* **Description:** This specialized crystal is a manifestation of concentrated Z-Power specifically harmonized with the evolutionary line of the Grass-type starter, Rowlet. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that cannot be bought or sold at standard Poké Marts. It is a "Signature" Z-Crystal, meaning its utility is restricted to a single Pokémon species.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). As a Key-like inventory item in Gen VII, it is obtained through story progression and cannot be traded away or lost.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Decidueye** that knows the move **Spirit Shackle**, it allows the Pokémon to unleash the exclusive Z-Move **Sinister Arrow Raid**. 
    * **Sinister Arrow Raid** is a Physical Ghost-type attack with a massive **180 Base Power**.
    * It bypasses standard accuracy checks (never misses) but can be blocked by *Protect* (though it still deals 25% chip damage).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief/Covet*, or traded via *Trick/Switcheroo*.
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically a **Niche/Signature Staple** in the Sun/Moon (Gen 7) meta. It provides Decidueye with a high-damage "nuclear option" to bypass defensive walls. While powerful, it occupies the item slot, preventing the use of *Life Orb* or *Leftovers*. In modern formats (Gen 8+), this item is unavailable as the Z-Move mechanic was retired.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It requires the trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** to function in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the player typically receives this from **Professor Kukui** in Malie Garden after defeating him/meeting him there, or as a gift if Decidueye was the player's chosen starter.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact within the game world, categorized as a symbol of the bond between a trainer and their Decidueye.
