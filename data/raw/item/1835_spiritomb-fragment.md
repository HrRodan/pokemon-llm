## Identity & Utility
**Spiritomb Fragment** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation 9 (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed by or harvested from Spiritomb. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly from the bag but serves as a resource at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine).
* **Cost:** 240 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Standard material value**; can be exchanged for 240 League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient in the crafting recipes for various TMs. These fragments are required to "print" moves that Spiritomb is capable of learning, typically focusing on Ghost or Dark-type utility and offensive moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the fragment itself has no battle utility, it is essential for the "Technical Machine" system, allowing players to teach competitive-grade moves to their Pokémon during the team-building phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized strictly as a resource for the Paldean TM crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase at Poke Marts or Delibird Presents. It is acquired exclusively as a drop from wild encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item, it is dropped upon defeating or catching a wild **Spiritomb**. 
* **Farming Context:** Unlike common materials, Spiritomb Fragments are significantly rarer due to Spiritomb’s status as a rare or fixed-location spawn in the Paldea region (and Kitakami). They are often gathered in bulk only through the use of Ghost or Dark-type "Encounter Power" Sandwiches or by farming specific static spawn points.
