## Identity & Utility
**Bug Memory** is a **Memories** category item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized data disc that contains Bug-type information. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for use by **Silvally**. While it has a defined price, it is typically treated as a collectible key-utility item rather than a standard consumable.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though usually acquired through story progression rather than shop purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the holder's type changes to **Bug**. Additionally, the move **Multi-Attack** changes its type to **Bug** to match the holder.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche.** In competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), the Bug Memory is rarely used because Bug is often considered a defensively weak typing. Silvally is more frequently seen with the Fairy, Steel, or Ground Memories. However, it can be utilized in lower tiers to provide a Bug-type pivot with access to *U-turn* and *Multi-Attack* for specialized coverage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the ability **RKS System**. It has no effect on any Pokémon other than Silvally. It cannot be removed or stolen via *Thief*, *Knock Off*, or *Trick* if held by Silvally.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), the Bug Memory is obtained as part of a complete set of 17 memories given to the player by Gladion at the Aether House or Ancient Poni Path. In later generations (Sword/Shield), it is provided by an NPC in the Battle Tower upon receiving Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made object developed by the **Aether Foundation** as part of "Project Beast Killer" to emulate the power of the Alpha Pokémon, Arceus.
