## Identity & Utility
**Smart Candy XL** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!* and *Let’s Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy designed for high-level Pokémon optimization. Unlike traditional vitamins (like Calcium), this item is part of the "Candy" system that bypasses Effort Values (EVs) in favor of **Awakening Values (AVs)**. It is a consumable medicine that can be sold, but its primary value lies in late-game stat boosting.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Minimal resale value**; primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than Mart purchases).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon of **Level 60 or higher**, it permanently increases its **Special Attack (Sp. Atk)** stat by 1 point in the Awakening Value (AV) system. 
* **Tier Logic:** This is the highest tier of "Smart" candies, following the standard Smart Candy (Level 1+) and Smart Candy L (Level 30+). It is required to continue boosting Special Attack once the Pokémon reaches the high-level threshold.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held items are not present in the *Let's Go* series).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Endgame Staple (Let’s Go Meta).** In the *Let's Go* competitive environment, maximizing AVs is mandatory. However, outside of these specific titles, this item does not exist and has no utility in standard Smogon or VGC (Gen 8+) formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for stat modification. It cannot be used if a Pokémon's Special Attack AV has already reached the maximum cap (200).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by transferring Pokémon to **Professor Oak**. Sending Pokémon from the same evolutionary line that excels in Special Attack (e.g., the **Abra**, **Gastly**, or **Magnemite** lines) increases the probability of receiving Smart-themed candies.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded through the **Catch Combo** mechanic; maintaining a high catch streak of Pokémon that yield Special Attack rewards will eventually drop XL-sized candies.
* **Context:** These candies represent the concentrated energy of Pokémon. The "XL" variant signifies a potency that only seasoned, high-level Pokémon can safely metabolize to push their power beyond natural limits.
