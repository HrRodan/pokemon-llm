## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (sco6527)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Larvitar**—to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable** event item that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal placeholder cost**; typically acquired via promotional codes rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area) and consumes this crystal, a red beam is activated. This initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This particular crystal (sco6527) is coded to spawn **Larvitar**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no utility in battle, it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon (Larvitar/Tyranitar) that is a perennial "Pseudo-Legendary" staple in VGC and Smogon formats. It allows players to obtain these Pokémon earlier in the game than naturally possible.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Consumption is restricted to the Watchtower Lair. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz and cannot be held by a Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific Dynamax Crystal was a **promotional distribution** provided as a bonus for purchasing the *Pokémon Sword and Shield Dual Pack* or through specific retail distributions (such as the "Secret Member Club" in Japan). It is not available through Marts or standard gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique digital key used to facilitate an encounter that would otherwise be version-exclusive (as Larvitar is normally exclusive to *Pokémon Shield*, this crystal allowed *Pokémon Sword* players to encounter it).
