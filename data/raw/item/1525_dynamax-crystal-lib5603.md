## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (LIB5603)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use, event-exclusive consumable item. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Special Event Item** that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this value is a placeholder in the game's data as the item is distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Ruins** (a specific den location in the Wild Area), the crystal forces a Max Raid Battle to spawn. Specifically, the **LIB5603** variant is the internal designation for the crystal that spawns **Larvitar**. This was historically used to allow players (specifically those with *Pokémon Sword*) to encounter Larvitar, which is otherwise a version-exclusive for *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles; its sole purpose is facilitating a Wild Area encounter for collection and breeding purposes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, the Pokémon caught through this raid may possess rare Hidden Abilities or high IVs common to Max Raid encounters, making them valuable for competitive breeding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily distributed as a **pre-order bonus** or through special promotional serial codes (e.g., the *Pokémon Sword and Shield Dual Pack*). It is not available in Poké Marts or found through standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Wonder Card" style digital distribution item. 
* **World Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent a localized concentration of Galar Particles, allowing a trainer to "call" a specific species to a dormant Power Spot regardless of the current weather or natural spawn tables.
