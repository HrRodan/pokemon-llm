## Identity & Utility
**Stretchy Spring** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A thin, small, and completely stretched-out spring of unknown purpose. It is a **Consumable/Treasure** item that serves no functional purpose in battle or the overworld other than being sold to vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Value-less**). Its low sell price (10 Poké Dollars) categorizes it as "junk" rather than high-value treasure like a Nugget or Big Pearl.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item has no active effect on Pokémon stats, health, or evolution. Its primary utility is to be sold at Poké Marts for a small amount of currency.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; provides no additional secondary effects when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a "flavor" item with no viability in Smogon or VGC formats as it cannot be held for benefit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution for any known Pokémon species. It does not interact with abilities such as Pickup in a way that generates value beyond its meager sale price.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily in the **Kanto region** during the events of Generation VII. It is typically discovered as a hidden item in locations like the **Underground Path** (connecting Route 5 and Route 6 or Route 7 and Route 8).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not known to be held by wild Pokémon. In its debut games, it is most commonly found by the player's **Partner Pokémon** (Pikachu or Eevee), who may signal its presence by wagging their tail when near hidden spots. It represents the "hidden trash" found in urban environments.
