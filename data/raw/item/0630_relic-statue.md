## Identity & Utility
**Relic Statue** is a **Loot Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone figure crafted by a civilization roughly 3,000 years ago. It serves as "vendor trash"—an item with no functional use in battle or the overworld other than being sold for significant currency. It is a **Consumable treasure** that **cannot be bought** from standard marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). While it has no purchase price, it is one of the most valuable sellable items in the franchise.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Relic Statue is designed to be sold to a specific NPC (the "Maniac" or billionaire) for a massive sum. In the Unova region (Black, White, Black 2, and White 2), it can be sold to the **Abyssal Ruins item maniac** in Undella Town for **200,000 Poké Dollars**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages and should never be held in a competitive environment.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with specific abilities like Pickup. It is purely an economic resource.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found deep within the **Abyssal Ruins** in the Unova region. It represents the pinnacle of the "Relic" series of items (Relic Copper, Silver, Gold, etc.). Because it is found in a location that requires the move Dive and has a step-limit mechanic, it is considered a rare "trophy" item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be found through exploration of ancient ruins or received via special distributions/events. Its presence in a player's inventory typically signifies progress into late-game exploration of the Unova region's history.
