## Identity & Utility
**Repeat Ball** is a **Poké Ball (Special)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball characterized by its distinct red and yellow circular pattern. It is a **Consumable** item used during wild encounters. Unlike standard balls that rely on HP depletion, this ball utilizes Pokédex data to increase its effectiveness. It can be bought at specialized outlets once the trainer has progressed mid-way through their journey.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). It sits in the same price tier as the Great Ball or Ultra Ball depending on the specific regional economy.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to capture a wild Pokémon. It features a conditional catch rate multiplier:
    * **Caught Species:** If the target Pokémon’s species is already marked as "Caught" in the player's Pokédex, the ball grants a **3× catch rate** (buffed to 3.5× in Generation VII+).
    * **New Species:** If the species has not been caught before, it functions as a standard Poké Ball with a **1× catch rate**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling for damage, and this data is null in the provided record).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item strictly for the "Catching" phase of the game. It is considered a staple for "Shiny Hunting" (where players encounter the same species repeatedly) and for competitive breeding, where trainers must catch multiple Ditto or high-IV specimens of the same species.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon a successful or failed throw (unless used in a Trainer battle, where the ball is lost without effect).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available at the **Devon Corporation** in Hoenn, or at specialized **Poké Marts** (often in larger cities like Lumiose or Wyndon) and the **Pokémon League**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured tool provided by companies like Silph Co. or Devon Corp.
* **Utility Context:** The Repeat Ball is the premier tool for "Pokedex Completionists" and "Shiny Hunters." Because its 3.5× multiplier (in modern titles) is higher than that of an Ultra Ball (2×), it is the most mathematically efficient ball for farming specific species for items (e.g., farming Chansey for Lucky Eggs) or for hunting specific Natures/Abilities within a single species family.
