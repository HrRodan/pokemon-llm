## Identity & Utility
**Psychic-Memory** is a **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized electronic memory disc containing Psychic-type data. It is a **Competitive Held Item** designed for form-shifting; unlike consumables, it is not used up after a single battle. It is technically purchasable/sellable in some contexts but is primarily acquired through story progression or specific NPC interactions.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically obtained as part of a set).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, this item triggers the **RKS System** ability, changing Silvally’s base type to **Psychic**. Additionally, it changes the type of Silvally's signature move, **Multi-Attack**, to Psychic-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Situational.** While it grants Silvally a Psychic typing and a powerful 120-base power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move in Multi-Attack, Silvally-Psychic is often overlooked in competitive tiers (like Smogon’s NU or PU). The main drawback is that it occupies the item slot, preventing the use of superior items like Choice Band or Life Orb, and the Psychic typing itself offers several common weaknesses (Bug, Ghost, Dark).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with **Silvally**. It has no effect when held by its pre-evolution, **Type: Null**, as Type: Null lacks the RKS System ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Pokémon Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), the Psychic-Memory is obtained from **Gladion** at the Aether House or Aether Paradise after the player becomes Champion. In later generations like Sword/Shield, it is purchased or gifted at the **Battle Tower** alongside the Silvally gift set.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made technological artifact created to mimic the power of the **Arceus Plates**. 
* **Lore Context:** The Memories were developed by the Aether Foundation as part of "Project Beast Killer" to allow Type: Null (and later Silvally) to adapt to any combat situation, specifically to counter Ultra Beasts.
