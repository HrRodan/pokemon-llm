## Identity & Utility
**Venusaurite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized held item that resonates with a Mega Ring/Bracelet. When held by a Venusaur, it allows the Pokémon to transcend its normal limits and undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is typically acquired as a unique gift or through specialized endgame currency like Battle Points (BP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Venusaur, the Trainer can trigger **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transforms Venusaur into **Mega Venusaur**, significantly boosting its Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Attack stats, while changing its ability to **Thick Fat**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: In standard play, Mega Stones cannot be removed or stolen via Thief, Knock Off, or Trick if held by the correct Pokémon, making the Fling power largely irrelevant unless held by a non-Venusaur).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-tier Defensive Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Gen 6, 7, and NatDex), Venusaurite is essential for transforming Venusaur into one of the game's premier "fat" attackers. The **Thick Fat** ability gained upon Mega Evolution removes its Fire and Ice-type weaknesses, making it exceptionally difficult to OHKO and a top-tier check to many offensive threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution; it is a temporary in-battle transformation. It is specific only to **Venusaur** and will have no effect if held by Bulbasaur or Ivysaur.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (X/Y), it is gifted by **Professor Sycamore** in Lumiose City if the player chooses Bulbasaur, or purchased from the Stone Emporium. In later generations (Sun/Moon/USUM), it is typically obtained via the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact associated with the lore of Mega Evolution and the bond between Trainer and Pokémon. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
