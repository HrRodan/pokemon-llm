## Identity & Utility
**Scyther Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Scyther evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or, more importantly, exchanged at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). In-game, it is more commonly valued for its exchange rate into League Points (LP) or used as a reagent for move-teaching items.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials generally cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Preparation Only).** While the item itself has no tactical value in a match, it is essential for the competitive circuit to "teach" optimal movesets to Pokémon via crafted TMs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Generation IX crafting system. It is specifically linked to the Scyther species (Scyther, Scizor, and Kleavor).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild Pokémon upon defeat or capture. It is primarily sourced from **Scyther**, **Scizor**, and **Kleavor** found in the wild (such as in the North Province or the Terarium).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item but a **guaranteed/high-probability drop** from the Scyther family. Players farming these claws often frequent areas where Scyther spawns in high density, such as grassy cliffs or forest biomes.
* **World Knowledge:** As a TM Material, its primary value is enabling access to powerful moves like **TM088 (Swords Dance)**, **TM105 (X-Scissor)**, or other slashing-based techniques that require Scyther's biological components to simulate the move's data.
