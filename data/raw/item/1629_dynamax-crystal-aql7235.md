## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQL7235** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable crystal used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It acts as a beacon to summon a specific Dynamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Utility** item that **cannot** be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Technical Value**; though assigned a cost in the data, it is an event-exclusive item not found in Poke Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty Den in the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Centiskorch** (often featuring its Gigantamax form). The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for initiating encounters. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors relevant to the VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** geography in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** as part of special promotions. Specifically, Dynamax Crystal AQL7235 was part of a Japanese promotion (such as the *CoroCoro Ichiban* magazine) to grant players early or guaranteed access to a Gigantamax Centiskorch raid.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a "Special Acquisition" item typically delivered via Mystery Gift or external codes.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals serve as a way for developers to host "localized" events, allowing players to challenge rare Raid bosses on their own schedule rather than relying on the rotating Wild Area News schedule.
