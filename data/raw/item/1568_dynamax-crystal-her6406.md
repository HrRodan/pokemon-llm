## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (her6406)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized promotional consumable used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. When used, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal price**; primarily distributed via promotional codes rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell region) causes a specific Pokémon—specifically **Hatterene** (often a Gigantamax-capable variant)—to appear as a Max Raid boss. The raid persists until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch system clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the item itself has no battle effect, it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that may possess its Hidden Ability or Gigantamax Factor, which are essential for VGC and Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used to facilitate a **Max Raid Battle** encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **Event-Exclusive**. Specifically, "her6406" corresponds to a promotional distribution (often via retail serial codes or specific regional events) intended to give players access to a Gigantamax Hatterene raid regardless of the standard den rotation or "Wishing Piece" RNG.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to be claimed via the "Mystery Gift" function and is not obtainable through the **Pickup** ability or standard gameplay loops.
