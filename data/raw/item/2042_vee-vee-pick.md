## Identity & Utility
**Vee-Vee-Pick** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative food pick used specifically during the Sandwich-making minigame at picnics. It features a design inspired by Eevee (often referred to by the nickname "Vee-Vee"). It is a **Consumable Sandwich Ingredient/Accessory** that can be purchased in bulk.
* **Cost:** 480 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used during the final stage of sandwich preparation to secure the ingredients together. While the pick choice is largely aesthetic, it is a required component to complete any sandwich in the Paldean picnic mechanic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists exclusively for the overworld Picnic/Sandwich mechanic and provides no direct combat statistics, though the sandwiches it helps create can provide "Meal Powers" (e.g., Sparkling Power, Egg Power, Encounter Power).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-specific abilities like Pickup or Klutz. Its sole interaction is with the **Sandwich-making** interface.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized culinary shops throughout the Paldea region, most notably at **Artisan Bakery** and **Every Wich Way** branches in major cities like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced consumer good for trainers participating in the Paldean picnic culture. 
* **Thematic Context:** Part of a series of collectible picks (like the Pikachu-themed Pika-Pika Pick), the Vee-Vee-Pick allows trainers to customize their sandwich presentation while benefiting from the buffs provided by the ingredients underneath.
