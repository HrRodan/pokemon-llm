## Identity & Utility
**Quick Candy L** is a **Vitamin (Stat Booster)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically appearing in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's Speed stat. Unlike traditional vitamins (like Carbos), this is a "Large" tier candy, meaning it is specifically formulated for mid-to-high level Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that is technically purchasable but primarily earned through gameplay mechanics.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Very Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon that is **Level 30 or higher**, it increases that Pokémon's **Speed Awakening Values (AVs)** by 1. In the *Let's Go* engine, AVs provide a direct +1 bonus to the stat, up to a maximum of 200 per stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in its native games).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is essential for "No Restrictions" competitive play within the *Let's Go* series to maximize a Pokémon's speed tier. However, it has no effect in standard VGC or Smogon formats for Gen 8 or 9, as the Candy/AV system was replaced by the return of Effort Values (EVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a three-tier hierarchy:
    1. **Quick Candy:** For any level.
    2. **Quick Candy L:** For Lv. 30+.
    3. **Quick Candy XL:** For Lv. 60+.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by transferring Speed-oriented Pokémon (such as **Pidgey**, **Rattata**, or **Pikachu**) to **Professor Oak**. It can also be rewarded for playing mini-games in the **GO Park** or as a rare drop when walking a Pokémon with the **Poké Ball Plus**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through the "Catch Combo" mechanic—catching many Speed-focused Pokémon in a row significantly increases the chance of receiving Quick Candies of various sizes as post-capture rewards.
* **World Knowledge:** The "L" size represents a mid-tier efficiency boost, bridging the gap between early-game stat growth and the end-game optimization provided by XL candies. It reflects the simplified training mechanics of the Kanto reboot titles.
