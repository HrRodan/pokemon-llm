## Identity & Utility
**TM62** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A data-disc used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In Generation IV, it teaches **Silver Wind**, but from Generation V onwards, it is redefined to teach **Acrobatics**. It is a **Consumable** item in early generations (IV) and becomes **Infinite-use** in later iterations (V through VII, and VIII onwards).
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its status as a high-tier offensive move often found in late-game Department Stores.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. 
    * **Modern (Gen V-IX):** Teaches **Acrobatics**, a Flying-type physical move with 55 Base Power. If the user is not holding an item, the power doubles to **110**.
    * **Legacy (Gen IV):** Teaches **Silver Wind**, a Bug-type special move with 60 Base Power and a 10% chance to raise all of the user's stats by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be utilized via the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Acrobatics).** TM62 is a competitive staple for Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (like Hawlucha or Drifblim) or those utilizing consumable items like Berries or Gems. Once the item is consumed, Acrobatics becomes one of the most efficient Flying-type moves in the game due to its high power and lack of recoil.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "nimble" Pokémon, particularly Flying, Bug, and Fighting types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in major region Department Stores (such as the Veilstone or Shopping Mall Nine) or given as a reward for navigating specific environmental puzzles (e.g., Route 7 in Unova or Route 119 in Hoenn). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or found as a localized item ball in the overworld.
* **Regional Context:** In its debut region (**Sinnoh**), it represented the mystical power of the wind (Silver Wind), but shifted in Unova to represent tactical agility (Acrobatics) to match the faster-paced competitive meta introduced in Generation V.
