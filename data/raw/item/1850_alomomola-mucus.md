## Identity & Utility
**Alomomola Mucus** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized material dropped by the Pokémon Alomomola. It is a consumable crafting component used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly in battle or held for any effect.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a recipe ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, it is a required component for high-utility moves, most notably **TM123 (Surf)** and **TM145 (Water Pulse)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly for the "overworld" crafting economy and holds no value in competitive VGC or Smogon formats beyond the initial acquisition of moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution for any known species. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Alomomola**. They are commonly found in the marine environments of the Paldean Sea.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" that can be stolen with Thief or Covet, it is automatically added to the player's inventory upon the successful defeat or capture of Alomomola in Generation IX. 
* **Context:** Representing the medicinal and slippery coating of the "Caring Pokémon," this mucus is highly valued for its aquatic properties, making it a logical component for Water-type TM production.
