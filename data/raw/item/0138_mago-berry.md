## Identity & Utility
**Mago Berry** is a **Picky-healing Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A holdable berry that provides emergency healing when a Pokémon's health drops below a specific threshold. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is highly accessible and can be grown in large quantities in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP falls to **1/2 (50%) or less**, the Mago Berry is consumed to restore **1/8 (12.5%) of the user's maximum HP**. 
    * *Flavor Penalty:* If the Pokémon dislikes **Sweet** flavors (specifically Natures that lower **Speed**: Brave, Relaxed, Quiet, and Sassy), it will become **Confused** after consumption.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. If used with the move **Fling**, the target receives the healing effect but also risks confusion if they dislike Sweet flavors.
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Ghost-type** attack with a base power of 100 (in Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically part of the "Pinch Berry" group (alongside Figy, Wiki, Aguav, and Iapapa). While the JSON specifies 1/8 HP restoration, these berries are most famous in competitive VGC/Smogon for their Gen VII buff (50% recovery) and subsequent Gen VIII nerf (33% recovery). They are vital for bulky attackers and tanks that need recovery without using a move slot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Abilities:** Its effectiveness is doubled by the **Ripen** ability (restoring 1/4 HP) and can be recycled via **Harvest** or **Cud Chew**.
    * **Bug Bite/Pluck:** If an opponent uses these moves, they consume the berry and may become confused if they have a Speed-lowering nature.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry Trees throughout various regions (Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, Alola). It can also be obtained through the Berry Pots or the Poké Pelago.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon based on current data, but often mass-produced via **Berry Gardening**. In older generations, it was a common prize from the **Pickup** ability at mid-range levels.
* **Lore:** Its name is a play on the word "Mango," and it is characterized by its unique sweet flavor that only certain Pokémon temperaments appreciate.
