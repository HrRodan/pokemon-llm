## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (HYA3418)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special, single-use consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (associated with the "HYA" designation, typically Hydreigon or a related event encounter) to appear as a Dynamax boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot** be purchased through standard in-game Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While a cost exists in the data, these items are functionally event-exclusive and cannot be bought in bulk; the low value reflects its status as a promotional item rather than a standard commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is triggered. This allows the player and their allies to challenge a specific Max Raid Battle. The encounter persists until the player wins or the day ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer-vs-Trainer battles. It is strictly a utility item for Pokémon acquisition and PvE (Player vs. Environment) Raid content.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but is the primary method for encountering specific Pokémon that may otherwise be rare or version-exclusive.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are typically distributed via **Mystery Gift serial codes**, often as part of retail promotions (e.g., Target, GameStop, or Pokémon Center pre-order bonuses). They are not available through normal gameplay progression.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a high-tier event item intended for the player's inventory to facilitate rare encounters.
* **Lore Context:** The "HYA" code in the name is an internal identifier for the specific raid encounter. These crystals react with the Power Spots of Galar to force a localized Dynamax phenomenon, bypassing the usual random rotation of Raid dens.
