## Identity & Utility
**TR12 (Agility)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. This particular TR contains **Agility**, a Psychic-type status move. Unlike the TMs (Technical Machines) of its debut generation, this is a **Consumable** item that breaks after one use. 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate**). In its native Galar region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** (W) at Wild Area Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently teaches the move **Agility** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Effect:** The user relaxes and lightens its body, **sharply raising its Speed stat** (by two stages).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low). Consuming the item via Fling provides no additional secondary effects.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Staple Utility.** Agility is a vital tool for "Set-up Sweepers" (e.g., Metagross, Lucario, or Kingambit) who possess high offensive power but average Speed. Doubling the Speed stat in a single turn allows a Pokémon to outspeed almost the entire unboosted metagame, making it a cornerstone for late-game cleaning in Smogon and VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon across multiple types (mostly Bird, Psychic, and Electric types).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Galar Wild Area** via Watt Traders (inventory rotates daily) or as a reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Psychic-type or fast Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a manufactured technological record. In later generations (Gen IX onwards), this TR is replaced by the TM (Technical Machine) system where the move may be crafted at a TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
