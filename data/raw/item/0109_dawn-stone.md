## Identity & Utility
**Dawn Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone that sparkles like a glittering eye. It is a **Consumable** evolution catalyst used outside of battle to trigger transformations in specific Pokémon species that exhibit gender-based divergent evolution. 
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range**). While it has a sell/buy value, it is rarely available in standard Poké Marts and is typically found as a rare collectible or a reward for specific in-game tasks.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a compatible Pokémon, it triggers an immediate evolution. Unlike most evolution stones, its efficacy is strictly limited by the Pokémon's gender:
    * **Male Kirlia** evolves into **Gallade**.
    * **Female Snorunt** evolves into **Froslass**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage). Using Fling will consume the stone, making this a very costly one-time attack.
    * **Competitive Use:** It has no competitive utility as a held item. Its value lies entirely in the **Preparation Phase**, allowing trainers to access Gallade (a powerful Physical Sweeper) or Froslass (a notable Lead/Spikes setter with a unique Ghost/Ice typing).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is unique because it provides an alternative evolution path for species that otherwise evolve via leveling (Kirlia into Gardevoir or Snorunt into Glalie). It is essential for completing the Pokédex and building specific team compositions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized locations such as **Mt. Coronet (Sinnoh)**, Victory Road, or through the **Super Training** and **Poke Pelago** mechanics in later generations. In some titles, it can be purchased at high-end department stores or specialized shops (like the Stone Shop in Lumiose City).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a frequent find for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability, generally appearing in the high-level loot tables (typically Level 51-100) across multiple generations.
