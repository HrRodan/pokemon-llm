## Identity & Utility
**TR70 (Flash Cannon)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A high-intensity machine that teaches the move **Flash Cannon**. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records are single-use consumables that break after teaching the move. It is a one-time-use utility item used to provide Special Steel-type coverage or STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) to compatible Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/Consumable). In its native generation, it is more commonly acquired using Watts (W) from Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flash Cannon**. Flash Cannon is a Special Steel-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 10% secondary chance to lower the target's Special Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Substantial damage if used with the move Fling, though the machine is consumed in the process).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Essential.** Flash Cannon is the gold-standard Special Steel-type move. It is a staple for Special Attackers like **Magnezone, Heatran, Duraludon, and Lucario**. It provides critical coverage against Fairy, Ice, and Rock types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching device.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR70 is primarily obtained by defeating Steel-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** within the Wild Area, Isle of Armor, or Crown Tundra. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts) or found in the Cram-o-matic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. This item is historically manufactured or rewarded through raid combat, emphasizing the "Record" nature of the item being a data-heavy, consumable version of a Technical Machine.
