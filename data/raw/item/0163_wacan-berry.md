## Identity & Utility
**Wacan Berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable berry that acts as a defensive safeguard. When held by a Pokémon, it is automatically consumed to mitigate damage from a single incoming Electric-type move, provided the move is super-effective. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be bought, though it is often more common to obtain it through gardening or wild encounters.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a super-effective **Electric-type** move, the Wacan Berry is consumed to reduce the damage of that specific hit by **50%**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes an **Electric-type** attack with **80 Base Power** (Gen IV-V) or **60 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche Strategic Staple**. It is primarily used on Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Electric attacks—most notably **Gyarados**, **Pelipper**, or **Mantine**—to survive a "4x super-effective" hit and retaliate or set up (e.g., Dragon Dance or Tailwind). It is also seen on high-value defensive pivots like **Toxapex** in specific VGC or Smogon formats to lure and survive Electric-type coverage moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Does not evolve any Pokémon.
    * Synergizes with the ability **Harvest** (allowing for repeated consumption) and **Ripen** (doubling the damage reduction to 75%).
    * Triggered by the **Unburden** ability upon consumption.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized Berry Shops, through the Sinnoh/Kalos/Hoenn berry-growing mechanics, or as a reward from specific NPCs (e.g., the Berry Master). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Buizel** and **Floatzel** (5% chance). These can be efficiently farmed using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or gathered via the **Pickup** ability at specific level tiers depending on the game version.
