## Identity & Utility
**Fairy Gem** is a **Jewel** (Type-enhancing Gem) introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A gem containing the "essence of the fey." It is a **Consumable Held Item** that triggers automatically when the holder uses a damaging Fairy-type move. Once the move is performed, the item is consumed and disappears.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though typically found through exploration rather than purchased in bulk at standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Fairy-type move, the power of that move is increased by **1.5×** (50% boost), and the Gem is consumed. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems generally cannot be used effectively with Fling; they are intended to be consumed via type-triggering).
    * **Competitive Use:** While most elemental gems were introduced in Gen V, the Fairy Gem was added in Gen VI to support the then-new Fairy type. It is a "One-turn Nuke" item. Its most significant competitive synergy is with the ability **Unburden** (e.g., on **Slurpuff**), where using the Gem grants a massive power boost and immediately doubles the user's Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat-oriented consumable.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Kalos), Gems are often found as hidden items or by destroying cracked rocks (Rock Smash) in locations like **Glittering Cave**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not currently held** by any wild Pokémon species. It must be gathered through world exploration or specific regional mechanics (like the Poke Mile Club or specialized shops in later generations).
* **World Knowledge:** In later generations (Gen VII onwards), most elemental gems (including the Fairy Gem) became difficult to obtain or were restricted to the Normal Gem only in standard competitive play, making the Fairy Gem a rare relic of the Kalos and Hoenn (ORAS) era.
