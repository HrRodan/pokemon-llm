## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Ori1948** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to appear. It is a single-use consumable that remains active only until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a technical price in the data, it is not sold in any standard Poké Mart; it is an event-exclusive item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty den at the Watchtower Ruins (Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to generate a red beam of light. This spawns a specific **Max Raid Battle** (the exact species is determined by the specific crystal ID, typically a Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or a rare encounter). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in trainer-vs-trainer battles. Its utility lies entirely in the "overworld" mechanics of the Galar Wild Area to facilitate the capture of high-IV or Hidden Ability Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon, but it is often the only way to encounter specific **Gigantamax** forms outside of rare, time-limited Wild Area News events.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **Event-Only**. Dynamax Crystals with specific serial codes (like ★Ori1948) were typically distributed via retail promotions, pre-order bonuses, or Japanese magazines such as *CoroCoro Comic*.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via the **Mystery Gift** "Get with Code/Password" function.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals are highly concentrated forms of Galar Particles that can pinpoint a specific Dynamax signature at a dormant Power Spot.
