## Identity & Utility
**TR72 (Power Whip)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Power Whip**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic consumable mechanic for high-powered moves. 
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). In its debut region, it is frequently exchanged for Watts rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Power Whip** to a compatible Pokémon. Power Whip is a high-intensity Physical Grass-type move with a base power of 120 and an accuracy of 85%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120. When used with the move Fling, this item deals massive damage, matching the base power of the move it contains.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Offensive Coverage.** Power Whip is a staple for physical Grass-type attackers (such as Ferrothorn, Rillaboom, or Tsareena) who need a high-damage option to break through bulky Water, Ground, and Rock types. While the 85% accuracy carries a risk of missing, the damage output is often preferred over the weaker but more accurate Seed Bomb.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, TR72 is primarily obtained by defeating Grass-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 5,000 - 8,000 Watts). Its high Poké Dollar value (16,000) reflects its status as a premier offensive tool.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is typically manufactured or found as a reward for Raid dens. It is highly sought after by trainers looking to maximize the physical wall-breaking potential of their team.
