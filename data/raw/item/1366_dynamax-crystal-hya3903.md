## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (hya3903)** is a **Special Event Item** (Categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a specialized utility item that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but functionally **Not for Sale** as it is an event-exclusive distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arriving at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins), the player can use this crystal to summon a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. While the flavor text uses a variable placeholder `[VAR (0000)]`, these specific crystals were historically used for event distributions such as **Gigantamax Centiskorch**, **Larvitar**, or **Jangmo-o**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is used exclusively in the overworld).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its value lies in providing access to specific Pokémon that may have high IVs, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax factors, which are then used in competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts. It was distributed via **Serial Codes** or special promotions (such as those found in the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack* or through retailers like GameStop/Target). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to facilitate unique encounters that are otherwise version-exclusive or rare.
* **Context:** These crystals were a primary method for The Pokémon Company to distribute "Event Raids," allowing players to face specific challenges on their own schedule rather than relying on the rotating Wild Area News schedule.
