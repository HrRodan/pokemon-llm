## Identity & Utility
**Tauros Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutritional supplement packed with species-specific energy. Unlike generic candies, it is designed exclusively for the **Tauros** evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than traditional shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). In the context of its debut games, these are more frequently sold by the player for minor profit or earned as rewards rather than purchased from a Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Tauros, it increases **all six of its stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 point**. These points contribute to the **Awakening Values (AVs)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling in its debut generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is essential for the "No Restrictions" competitive ruleset in *Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee*, where AVs are active. In this format, a Pokémon can gain up to +200 in every stat via Candy, making "Candy-maxing" mandatory for high-level play. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats where the AV system is absent.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancer. It bypasses the limitations of standard vitamins (like Protein or Iron), as it can be used to reach the maximum AV cap of 200 per stat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through the **Catch Combo** mechanic (repeatedly catching Tauros) or by **transferring** captured Tauros to Professor Oak. It represents the "essence" or specialized training data of the species.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon as a held item. It is exclusively awarded to the trainer for proficient catching or for participating in the "Go Park" transfer system.
* **World Knowledge:** Species Candies like the Tauros Candy are considered the most efficient way to power up a Pokémon in the Kanto-reimagined Alola era, as they provide a more comprehensive growth path than the "size" candies (Quick Candy, Tough Candy, etc.) which only boost single stats.
