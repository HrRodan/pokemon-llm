## Identity & Utility
**Wiglett Sand** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** A specific crafting resource dropped by members of the Wiglett evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that can be sold at Poké Marts, though its primary value lies in the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) system. 
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible resource currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). Within the TM Machine, players combine League Points (LP) with specific quantities of Wiglett Sand to create move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials typically cannot be used effectively in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no held-item utility or on-field effect. It exists solely within the "crafting and collection" meta-game of the Paldea region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a reagent for the following TMs (World Knowledge Context):
    * **TM016 (Psybeam)**
    * **TM022 (Chilling Water)**
    * **TM133 (Earth Power)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching wild **Wiglett** or **Wugtrio**. It can also be found as a sparkling item drop on beaches and coastal terrain throughout the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Wiglett** and **Wugtrio** upon their defeat. Players frequently farm this item along the East and West Paldean Seas. 
* **Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, Wiglett Sand represents the gritty residue or sediment associated with the Eel Pokémon's burrowing behavior. It serves as a fundamental mid-tier crafting material for Water and Ground-type moves.
