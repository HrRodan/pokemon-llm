## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR6812** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, single-use event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear for the remainder of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**); however, this value is purely internal as the item is typically acquired via serial codes or special distributions rather than Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the player can "insert" this crystal into the empty den. This immediately initiates a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (specifically **Gigantamax Corviknight** for this SGR6812 variant). The raid remains active until defeated or until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item. Its value lies in providing access to a Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or the Gigantamax Factor for use in competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, it is the only way to encounter certain Gigantamax forms outside of rare den rotations or limited-time Wild Area News events.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional tie-ins (such as retail distributions or magazine bonuses like *CoroCoro*). It is not found in the overworld or sold by NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special" item tied to the Dynamax phenomenon unique to the Galar region's Power Spots.
* **Context:** The "SGR" prefix in the name typically refers to internal tracking for specific retail or regional promotions. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which spawn random encounters, these crystals guarantee a specific, high-value encounter.
