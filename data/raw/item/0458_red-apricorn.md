## Identity & Utility
**Red-apricorn** is a specialized **Crafting Ingredient** (categorized under the Apricorn Box) introduced in Generation II and revitalized in Generation IV (HeartGold/SoulSilver).
* **Description:** A pungent, red-colored fruit described as having a scent that "assails the nostrils." It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that is not typically intended for direct use in battle or on a Pokémon, but rather as a raw material for artisan tool-making.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though primarily obtained through foraging rather than retail purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Red Apricorn's sole utility is as a manufacturing component. When given to the NPC **Kurt in Azalea Town**, he will process it over a 24-hour period to produce a **Level Ball**—a specialized Poké Ball that is more effective at catching Pokémon with a lower Level than the player's active Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no viable application in competitive formats (Smogon/VGC) as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect and its Fling power is among the lowest in the game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with abilities like Pickup. It is strictly a "collection and trade" item for Poké Ball enthusiasts.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily harvested from **Apricorn Trees** scattered throughout the **Johto region**. In the Generation IV remakes, these are stored in the Apricorn Box to save inventory space. While the JSON lists it as "Generation IV," it is historically a Johto-native resource.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon (`total_held_by: 0`). Unlike Berries, which can be farmed from wild encounters, Red Apricorns must be gathered from static overworld nodes.
* **Lore Context:** Apricorns represent the traditional, pre-industrial method of catching Pokémon. Before the mass production of Poké Balls by companies like Silph Co. or Devon Corp, artisans like Kurt were the primary source of capture devices, making these fruits vital to early Pokémon history.
