## Identity & Utility
**Watmel Berry** is a **Baking-only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A very large Berry, growing up to 10 inches in size, characterized by its sweet flavor and green rind. It is a **Consumable Cooking Ingredient** that is primarily used for crafting enhancements rather than direct battle utility. While it can be bought or sold for a nominal fee, it is typically acquired through cultivation.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Watmel Berry has **no direct effect** when consumed in battle or used from the bag for healing. Its primary utility lies in the creation of **Pokéblocks** (Gen III/VI) and **Poffins** (Gen IV/VIII). It is highly valued for its ability to significantly boost specific Contest conditions (specifically Sweetness/Cuteness) due to its high flavor profile.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no additional status effect when thrown.
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Fire-type** attack with **100 Base Power**. This was its only niche competitive use in older generations to provide physical attackers with surprise Fire-type coverage.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-existent.** Beyond the defunct Natural Gift mechanic, it holds no value in VGC or Smogon formats, as it does not trigger upon HP thresholds or status changes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Used to raise Pokémon Contest stats. In games where Feebas evolves via the **Beauty** condition, high-quality berries in this family (though Watmel is primarily Sweet/Cute) are essential for maximizing stats without filling the "sheen" or "lustre" meter prematurely.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained through late-game Berry patches or gifted by NPCs. In its debut (Hoenn), it was a rare berry obtained from the **Berry Master's Wife** by telling her the specific phrase "GREAT BATTLE." In Sinnoh, it is used specifically for high-level Poffin baking.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike common berries (like Oran or Cheri), it cannot be efficiently farmed via the **Pickup** ability and must be grown in soil to increase stock.
* **Cultivation:** Known for one of the longest growth cycles and lowest yields in the series, reflecting its status as a "rare" ingredient for dedicated Contest participants.
