## Identity & Utility
**Shellder Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with energy. Unlike generic vitamins, this candy is tailored to the Shellder evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that cannot be purchased from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**). This low cost reflects its status as a common reward for catching Pokémon rather than a retail luxury item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a compatible Pokémon, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 point. In the context of the *Let's Go* engine, these points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, which function differently than traditional Effort Values (EVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is strictly used for stat-maxing in the *Let's Go* series. It has no utility in standard VGC, Smogon, or main-series titles (Gen VIII and beyond), as the AV system was replaced by the returning EV system. In its native game, however, it is essential for optimizing a **Cloyster** for Master Trainers or high-level NPC battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is exclusive to **Shellder** and its evolution, **Cloyster**. It does not trigger evolution; it is purely for stat enhancement.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in Marts. It is primarily acquired through the "Catch Combo" mechanic by catching multiple Shellder in succession or by transferring Shellder to Professor Oak in exchange for rewards. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through the **Transfer** mechanic or as a reward for successful captures. In the *Let's Go* ecosystem, it represents the "essence" of the species, used to empower others of the same lineage.
