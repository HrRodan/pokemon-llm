## Identity & Utility
**Goomy Goo** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material left behind by members of the Goomy evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** that is primarily used at the TM Machine. While it has a sell value, it is not used as a medicine or held item.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Low Value**; primarily used as a crafting currency rather than for profit).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the TM Machine in the Paldea region (and other Gen IX locales) to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** This item provides no direct stat boosts or tactical advantages in battle. However, it is essential for teaching competitive moves to Pokémon via the TMs it creates.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is used to craft high-impact moves such as **TM115 (Dragon Pulse)** and **TM169 (Draco Meteor)**. It does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Goomy family. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is dropped exclusively by **Goomy**, **Sliggoo**, and **Goodra** (including Hisuian variants in Gen IX). It is often farmed in wetland or rainy biomes where these Pokémon congregate.
