## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ERI1298** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event-based consumable item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the crystal activates a specific raid encounter that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that is technically classified with a purchase price but is not available through standard in-game commerce.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Nominal). While the data assigns a minor cost, it is functionally a promotional item acquired via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific, otherwise empty Pokémon Den in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—typically a rare or version-exclusive encounter like Gigantamax Eevee or Larvitar—to appear for a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility/collection item used to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon which may then be used in competitive play. The item itself has no utility in a trainer-vs-trainer battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** location in the Galar region. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, these crystals guarantee a specific encounter associated with the "ERI" serial code series.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily through **serial codes** via pre-order bonuses, retail partnerships (such as Target or GameStop), or promotional magazines (like CoroCoro). It is not available for purchase at any Poké Mart or from the Watt Traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is an "Event-only" acquisition, making it a rare commodity for collectors and players looking to complete their Pokédex or obtain specific Raid rewards.
