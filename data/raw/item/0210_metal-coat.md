## Identity & Utility
**Metal Coat** is a **Type-Enhancement and Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation III** (historically appearing in Gen II).
* **Description:** A special metallic film applied as a coating. It functions as a holdable item that enhances the offensive capabilities of Steel-type attackers and serves as a catalyst for specific trade-based evolutions. It is a **Holdable/Consumable** (consumed only upon evolution) item that can be bought or found.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, it increases the power of the holder’s **Steel-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Evolution Trigger:** It is the essential requirement for two specific evolutions. When the following Pokémon are traded while holding a Metal Coat, they evolve, and the item is consumed:
    * **Onix** → **Steelix**
    * **Scyther** → **Scizor**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **niche offensive item**. While often outclassed by *Life Orb* (which boosts all moves by 30%) or *Choice Band*, the Metal Coat is used on Steel-type specialists who want to boost their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves—like Scizor’s *Bullet Punch* or Ferrothorn's *Gyro Ball*—without suffering recoil damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the trade mechanic to trigger form changes for the Scyther and Onix lines.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in industrial areas (Power Plants, Oreburgh Mine) or provided by NPCs. In many games, it is available for purchase at specialized shops or via Battle Points (BP).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is notably farmable from wild Pokémon. It is held by 12 different species, most commonly found on wild **Magnemite**, **Magneton**, **Bronzor**, **Bronzong**, and **Skarmory**. 
* **Farming Tip:** Players often use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to farm this item from wild Magnemite populations, as it is one of the most reliable ways to obtain multiple copies for evolution and competitive sets.
