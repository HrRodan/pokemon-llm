## Identity & Utility
**Safety Goggles** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that provides specialized protection against environmental and biological hazards. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought in specific late-game locations.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). While not overly expensive, it is often found in specialty shops like the Battle Maison or high-end boutiques.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The holder is granted total immunity to **Powder-based moves** and damage from **Sandstorm** and **Hail**. 
    * **Powder Immunity:** Protects against *Spore, Sleep Powder, Poison Powder, Stun Spore, Rage Powder, Cotton Spore,* and the move *Powder*.
    * **Weather Immunity:** Prevents the chip damage traditionally associated with Sandstorm and Hail (note: in Gen IX, Hail was replaced by Snow, which does not deal damage, slightly reducing the weather-utility of this item).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High physical damage for a utility item).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple**, particularly in VGC (Double Battles). It is the premier counter to the Pokémon **Amoonguss**, as it allows the holder to ignore *Rage Powder* redirection and prevents being neutralized by *Spore*. It is frequently used on setup sweepers or Trick Room attackers who cannot afford to be put to sleep.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item mimics the effects of the Ability **Overcoat**. It allows a Pokémon to function effectively within "Sand-trap" or "Hail-chip" teams without having the requisite typing (Rock/Steel/Ground or Ice).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at Battle Facilities (for BP) or specialized shops in the post-game. In Kalos, it is notably found in Lumiose City.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found on wild Pokémon**. It is considered a manufactured piece of tactical equipment rather than a natural occurrence, requiring the player to find it as a static overworld item or purchase it through earned currency.
