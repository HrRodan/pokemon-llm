## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (PSA8728)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An event-exclusive consumable used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a nominal internal price, it is not sold in Poke Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area), this crystal activates a red beam, spawning a specific, rare Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. This allows the player to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate encounters. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess Hidden Abilities or high IVs, making them valuable for breeding competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. Once the raid is defeated or the day ends, the effect expires and the item is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Mystery Gift** codes. These specific "PSA" series crystals were often tied to retail promotions (such as GameStop, EB Games, or UK retailer distributions) or pre-order bonuses for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is an event-only distribution item and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or Thief mechanics. 
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles that can force a "Power Spot" to activate, even if it is not naturally active at the time. This specific variant (PSA8728) was part of a series of promotional crystals used to give players early access to powerful Pokémon like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax-capable species.
