## Identity & Utility
**Space Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Stationery featuring a print depicting the expanse of space. It is a **Held item** used to compose and send messages to other players during Pokémon trades. While it is technically a consumable upon being "used" for a message, it can be erased and reused.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer can compose a message from a finite list of words and give the item to a Pokémon to hold. The recipient of the Pokémon can read the message and choose to store it in their PC or erase it to make the item reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Utility.** In Generations where Mail is present, it serves as a hard counter to item-manipulation strategies. Moves that remove or swap items—such as **Knock Off, Thief, Trick, and Switcheroo**—will automatically fail against a Pokémon holding Mail. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Space Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system; the Mail must be removed first.
    * **Sticky Hold Synergy:** While it mimics some effects of the *Sticky Hold* ability, it is strictly a mechanical byproduct of the Mail's coding to protect the message data.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at Poké Marts across the Sinnoh region (e.g., Jubilife City, Hearthome City).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured item intended for Trainer communication.
* **Lore Context:** Space Mail reflects the Generation IV themes of space and time (Dialga/Palkia), serving as a cosmetic variant of standard stationery for players wishing to theme their trades.
