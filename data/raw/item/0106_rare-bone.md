## Identity & Utility
**Rare Bone** is a **Loot Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An archaeological artifact described as extremely valuable for the study of Pokémon history. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that is not intended for use in battle; its primary purpose is to be sold to vendors to generate wealth.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it can be bought for this price in specific rare scenarios, it is typically acquired for free and sold for a high return.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as "Vendor Trash." It can be sold at any Poké Mart for 2,500 Poké Dollars (standard half-price resale) or up to 5,000 Poké Dollars depending on the specific game's economy. In certain regions like Unova, a specialized **Item Maniac** (the "Bone Man" in Route 18) will purchase it for a premium of 10,000 Poké Dollars.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** **100**. This is a remarkably high base power for the move Fling, making it a heavy—if inefficient—projectile.
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no passive stat boosts or recovery. Using it for Fling is considered a "niche meme" strategy at best, as items like the Iron Ball (130 Power) provide more damage for the same cost of a held-item slot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions. It is a frequent drop for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability (typically starting at Level 51+ depending on the generation).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically tied to the **Sinnoh Underground** and the **Grand Underground**, where it is excavated from walls. In other regions, it is found in desert biomes (like the Desert Resort) or through high-level scavenging.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Dwebble** and **Crustle** (5% chance). Expert players often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability and the move **Thief** to farm Rare Bones from these species for easy profit.
