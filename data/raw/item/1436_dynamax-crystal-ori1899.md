## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ORI1899)** is a **Special Event Item** (categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable item that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon—in this case, **Orbeetle**—appears in the den, and the effect persists until the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a defined internal cost, it is technically **not for sale** in standard Marts and is acquired through external distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone ruin in the East Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it generates a red beam that initiates a Max Raid Battle. This allows the player to encounter and attempt to catch a Pokémon that may otherwise be rare or possess the **Gigantamax Factor**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** This is a utility item for the overworld. However, it is high-value for competitive players as it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon (Orbeetle) that may have specific Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax capabilities necessary for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use and requires the player to have reached the Wild Area in *Pokémon Sword* or *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** during special promotional events (often through retailers like Target in the US or various game stores in Europe). It is not found through normal gameplay or as a random drop.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items that can be farmed via the **Pickup** ability, Dynamax Crystals are strictly event-exclusive "Key-style" consumables.
* **Lore Context:** The "ORI" in the name refers to the internal shorthand for the Pokémon it summons (Orbeetle). These crystals represent highly concentrated Galar particles used to force a Dynamax phenomenon in a dormant power spot.
