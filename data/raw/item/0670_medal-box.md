## Identity & Utility
**Medal Box** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, box-shaped machine designed to store Medals and track achievement information. It acts as the primary interface for the "Medal Rally" sub-quest, documenting the player's milestones. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be sold, traded, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; unique quest acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a digital ledger for Medals. These Medals are awarded for completing specific in-game tasks, such as catching a certain number of Pokémon, using the PC frequently, or winning battles. It allows the player to view their current rank and total number of achievements.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for single-player progression and achievement tracking. It provides no tactical advantage in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. Its primary interaction is with **Mr. Medal**, an NPC who appears in Pokémon Centers to grant the player new medals and update the box's contents.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to **Pokémon Black 2 and White 2**. It is obtained early in the story from Mr. Medal at the Floccesy Town Pokémon Center. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a Key Item, it is unique to the protagonist and cannot be farmed or gathered via abilities like **Pickup**. It represents the Unova region's structured achievement system, rewarding players for diverse playstyles beyond just battling.
