## Identity & Utility
**Grass Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A memory disc containing high-density Grass-type data. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for a single species of Pokémon. While it has a listed cost, it is historically treated as a "Special Acquisition" or Key Item-adjacent tool that cannot be easily mass-purchased in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the item triggers the **RKS System** ability, changing Silvally's base type to **Grass**. Additionally, it changes the type of the move **Multi-Attack** to Grass-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. In competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), Grass-type Silvally is generally considered a lower-tier threat compared to its Fairy, Steel, or Ghost counterparts due to the defensive weaknesses inherent in the Grass type. However, it provides Silvally with a 120-base power physical Grass move (Multi-Attack) without the drawback of moves like Leaf Storm or Wood Hammer.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Ability Synergy:** This item is useless on any Pokémon other than Silvally. 
    * **Sticky Hold Property:** Under the RKS System, the Grass Memory cannot be removed from Silvally by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, nor can it be suppressed by *Embargo* or *Magic Room*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as part of a complete set of 17 Memories. In *Pokémon Sun/Moon* and *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*, it is gifted to the player by **Gladion** at Aether Paradise. In *Pokémon Sword/Shield*, it is obtained from an NPC in the Battle Tower after obtaining Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a man-made technological artifact created by the Aether Foundation to stabilize the "Beast Killer" project (Type: Null).
