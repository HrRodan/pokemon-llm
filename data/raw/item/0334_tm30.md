## Identity & Utility
**TM30** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** categorized under **All-Machines**. While this specific data entry identifies its origin as **Generation III (Hoenn)**, the TM is a long-standing series staple.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. In all iterations from Generation II through Generation IX, it teaches the move **Shadow Ball**. In Generation I, it historically contained **Teleport**. It is a **Consumable/Instructional** item (single-use in early generations and BDSP; infinite-use in Generations V-VIII).
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Shadow Ball** to a compatible Pokémon. Shadow Ball is a Special Ghost-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 20% chance to lower the target's Special Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be held or used with Fling in most competitive formats; they are utilized outside of active combat).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Shadow Ball is the definitive Special Ghost-type move. It is mandatory for Special Attackers like **Gengar**, **Dragapult**, and **Flutter Mane**. It provides excellent neutral coverage, as only Normal and Dark types resist or immune Ghost-type attacks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a massive movepool of Pokémon, including almost all Ghost, Psychic, and many diverse "human-like" or "mystical" Pokémon (e.g., Lucario, Gardevoir).
