## Identity & Utility
**TM34** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation III** (though the TM system and index number date back to Generation I).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. According to the provided metadata, it currently teaches **Sludge Wave**, a powerful Poison-type move that swamps the battlefield to strike all adjacent targets. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game's engine) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sludge Wave** to a compatible Pokémon. Sludge Wave is a Special Poison-type move with 95 Base Power and a 10% chance to poison the target. In older iterations of the TM index, this machine taught **Shock Wave** (Gen III-IV), **Swagger** (Gen II), or **Bide** (Gen I).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Sludge Wave is highly valued in competitive formats (Smogon and VGC) as the premier Poison-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for Special Attackers like Gengar, Nidoking, and Nihilego. It is preferred over Sludge Bomb for its slightly higher power and its ability to bypass the "Bulletproof" ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to Pokémon with compatible learnsets; typically Special Attackers or Poison/Ground/Dark types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game locations or high-end marketplaces. It is commonly sold at **Department Stores** (e.g., Lilycove or Shopping Mall Nine) or traded for Battle Points (BP) at the **Battle Frontier/Battle Maison**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon; it must be found as a field item (Poké Ball on the ground) or purchased from specialized vendors. Its high cost reflects its status as a high-tier offensive coverage move.
