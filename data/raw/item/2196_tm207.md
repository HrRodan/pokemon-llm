## Identity & Utility
**TM207 (Temper Flare)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches the move **Temper Flare** to compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX context, TMs are consumable but can be reproduced using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy economy, it is primarily obtained through crafting with League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials rather than being purchased at a standard Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Temper Flare**, a Physical Fire-type move.
    * **Move Logic:** Temper Flare has a Base Power of 75. However, if the user's previous move failed (due to being blocked by *Protect*, missing, or being nullified by an ability/type immunity), the power of this move doubles to **150**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche/Strategic** move. It is particularly valuable for physical Fire-type attackers in VGC (Doubles) or against defensive stallers. It serves as a "punishment" mechanic against opponents who rely heavily on *Protect* or redirection.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Physical attackers, particularly Fire-types (like Incineroar or Entei) and various Fighting or Ground-types with fiery tempers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to the **Blueberry Academy (Terarium)** region. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground in the Savannah Biome or crafted at any TM Machine once unlocked.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM, the trainer typically requires:
    * **5,000 LP**
    * **3x Chimchar Sparks**
    * **3x Tepig Sweat**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial instructional device created by the Blueberry Academy's technical systems.
