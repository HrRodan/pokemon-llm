## Identity & Utility
**Honey** is a **Dex-completion Consumable** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A sweet-smelling lure used to attract wild Pokémon. It functions as a single-use field item that simulates the effects of the move *Sweet Scent*. It is a **consumable utility item** that can typically be bought or gathered.
* **Cost:** 900 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Mid-range accessibility).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag in an area where wild Pokémon reside (tall grass, caves, or while surfing), it **immediately triggers a wild Pokémon encounter**. 
* **Special Mechanic (Sinnoh/Honey Trees):** In its debut region, Honey can be smeared on golden **Honey Trees**. After a real-time waiting period of six hours, a Pokémon will appear on the tree. This is the exclusive method for obtaining rare species such as **Burmy, Cherubi, Combee, and the elusive Munchlax**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional status effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no viable application in VGC or Smogon formats; its utility is strictly limited to the overworld and Pokédex completion (hunting for specific encounters or Hordes in later generations).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While not an evolution stone, it is functionally required to obtain **Combee**, which evolves into **Vespiquen**, and is the primary way to encounter **Munchlax** in the wild in Sinnoh.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Sinnoh, it is primarily sold by the Honey Man in **Floaroma Meadow**. In later games, it can be purchased in various Marts or specialized shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is frequently held by nectar-collecting or "sweet" Pokémon, specifically **Surskit**, **Combee**, **Cutiefly**, **Ribombee**, and all four styles of **Oricorio**.
* **Honey Gather Ability:** This item is unique in that it is the focal point of the **Honey Gather** ability (standard on Combee and Teddiursa), which allows the Pokémon to randomly pick up Honey after a battle, providing a renewable source for the player.
