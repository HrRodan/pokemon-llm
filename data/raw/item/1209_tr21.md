## Identity & Utility
**TR21 (Reversal)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Reversal**. Unlike TMs in its debut generation, a TR is consumed upon use, making it a high-value consumable resource for movepool expansion.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible). In its native Galar region, it is more commonly traded for Watts rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Reversal**, a Physical Fighting-type attack. 
    * **Move Logic:** The power of Reversal is inversely proportional to the user's remaining HP. It scales from a base power of 20 (at full HP) up to a devastating **200 base power** when the user is below 4.17% of their maximum health.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; not recommended for Fling strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-risk, high-reward **Competitive Niche** tool. It is famously paired with items like **Focus Sash** or the move **Endure** to intentionality drop the user's HP to 1. This strategy is most effective on fast Physical sweepers (e.g., Lucario, Blaziken, or Hawlucha) to deliver a 200-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) hit that can one-shot even bulky resists.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Fighting-types and aggressive Physical attackers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR21 is primarily acquired by defeating Fighting-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** found throughout the Wild Area. Its availability rotates daily among traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; TRs are manufactured items typically distributed as rewards for Dynamax-related challenges.
