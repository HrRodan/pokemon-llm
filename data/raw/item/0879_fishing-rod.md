## Identity & Utility
**Fishing Rod** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized tool designed for aquatic resource gathering and Pokémon encounters. In the Alola region, this item serves as the unified replacement for the tiered rod system (Old, Good, and Super Rods) found in previous generations. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows the player to initiate wild Pokémon encounters while facing bodies of water. In its specific Generation VII iteration, it is used specifically over piles of underwater rocks or submerged debris to reel in aquatic Pokémon or items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon and have no Fling power or effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. This item has no utility in competitive battling; its value is strictly for exploration, Pokédex completion, and team building during the main narrative.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but is the primary method for encountering specific Pokémon such as Magikarp, Wishiwashi, and Mareanie. It is also a source for obtaining rare items like **Bottle Caps** through fishing in specific locations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific iteration of the Fishing Rod is gifted to the player by **Trial Captain Lana** after the player visits Brooklet Hill. Unlike previous regions where rods were obtained from various "Fishing Gurus," this rod is lore-distinct as being "made by Captain Lana."
* **Wild Held Item:** This item cannot be found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique story-related item.
