## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (her6148)** is a specialized **Event Item (Dynamax Crystal)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use promotional item designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle encounter at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once consumed, the encounter remains active until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal cost, it is not sold in Poké Marts and is typically obtained via serial code distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a red beam is activated, spawning a specific Max Raid Battle. Based on the "her6148" internal designation, this crystal is part of a series of promotional distributions (such as those for **Gigantamax Centiskorch** or other retail-exclusive encounters).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item used solely to facilitate the capture of specific Pokémon or the farming of Raid rewards (TRs, Exp. Candies, and Berries).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area. It bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces for that specific den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail promotions (e.g., GameStop, GAME, or movie tie-ins). It is not available through regular exploration or Marts. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Dynamax Crystal," a subset of items meant to bridge real-world promotions with in-game encounters.
* **Context:** The "her" prefix in the internal name suggests a "Hidden Encounter Raid." These crystals were a core part of the Generation VIII live-service model, encouraging players to visit physical locations or participate in community events to unlock rare Gigantamax encounters early or outside of standard den rotations.
