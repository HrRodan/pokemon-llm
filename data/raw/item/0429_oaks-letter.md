## Identity & Utility
**Oak's Letter** is an **Event Item** (Key Item) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A formal letter sent by Professor Oak inviting the Trainer to Route 224 to assist in a discovery. It is a **Key Item** that is **not for sale** and cannot be discarded or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired via special distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the **White Rock** at the end of **Route 224**, the item triggers an event where Professor Oak asks the player to name someone they are thankful for. Upon completion, the **Seabreak Path** opens, creating a flower-filled bridge to **Flower Paradise**, where the Mythical Pokémon **Shaymin** can be battled and caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely as a narrative and encounter trigger for a Mythical Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the exclusive gatekeeper for the Shaymin encounter in the original Sinnoh games (*Pokémon Platinum* specifically, as the event was never officially released for *Diamond* and *Pearl*). While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is the only way to obtain a Shaymin that the player can later transform into its **Sky Forme** using the Gracidea flower.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically distributed as a **Mystery Gift** via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for a limited time. It is not obtainable through normal gameplay or in-game Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique plot item intended to be delivered directly to the player's "Key Items" pocket.
* **Lore Context:** The letter represents Professor Oak's ongoing research into rare Pokémon across different regions. It highlights the theme of "gratitude," which is central to Shaymin's lore (the Gratitude Pokémon). Through this item, the geography of the Sinnoh region literally expands, revealing the longest route in the Pokémon world: Seabreak Path.
