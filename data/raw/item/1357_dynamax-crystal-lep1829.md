## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LEP1829** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specific event-based consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that remains active until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot** be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; this is a placeholder value as the item is typically obtained via serial codes from retail distributions rather than in-game shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area), it causes a pillar of light to appear, initiating a Max Raid Battle against a designated Pokémon. For the "LEP" series of crystals, these are traditionally associated with promotional encounters (often Eevee or its evolutions).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a cooperative Max Raid Battle to catch a Pokémon, often one with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax potential.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** map geometry in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through standard NPC vendors or Marts. It was distributed via **Serial Codes** during limited-time promotional events (such as those held at GameStop, EB Games, or through the Pokémon Trainer Club newsletter).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items that can be farmed via **Pickup**, these crystals are unique digital keys tied to specific event distributions.
