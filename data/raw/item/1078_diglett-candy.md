## Identity & Utility
**Diglett Candy** is a **Species-Specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with energy tailored to the Diglett evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought or sold for a nominal fee, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay loops rather than traditional shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Low Resale Value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a compatible Pokémon, it increases all six of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by +1 **Awakening Value (AV)**. 
* **Target Pokémon:** This item only functions on **Diglett** and **Dugtrio** (including their Alolan regional variants).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The **Fling** move and held items do not exist in the *Let's Go* series mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is central to the "Let's Go" competitive meta, where stats are maxed via AVs rather than EVs. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats in later generations, as the AV system was not carried forward.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancement tool that bypasses the traditional leveling process to reach "Awakened" stat caps.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Diglett or Dugtrio. Achieving a "Catch Combo" increases the likelihood of receiving these candies. They are also rewarded to the player by **Professor Oak** when "sending" Diglett/Dugtrio to his lab.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense; it is a guaranteed drop/reward for the act of capturing the specific species. 
* **Context:** Diglett Candy represents a shift in Pokémon training lore during the Alola/Kanto transition era, where "Awakening" a Pokémon's potential through specific nutrition replaced the rigorous "Effort Value" (EV) training found in other regions.
