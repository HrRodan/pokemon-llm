## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA6536)** is a **Special Event Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use consumable used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** (a stone ruin located in the Watchtower Ruins area of the Galar Wild Area). Upon use, it triggers a "Max Raid Battle" beacon, causing a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax boss. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic value; primarily distributed via serial codes or special promotions rather than Poke Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it summons a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. This encounter remains active until the end of the calendar day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists outside of the competitive battle circuit and is used exclusively in the overworld to facilitate rare encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (DRA6536) was part of a series of promotional distributions (such as the Dual Pack pre-order bonuses). It allows players to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusives, such as **Jangmo-o** or **Larvitar**, early in the game.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal exploration. It is acquired via **Mystery Gift serial codes** provided during special retail events or as a bonus for purchasing specific software bundles (e.g., the Pokémon Sword and Shield Dual Pack).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item tied to the Galar region's Max Raid mechanic.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals act as a concentrated source of Galar Particles, localized specifically to the Ruined Watchtower to force a Dynamax phenomenon in a controlled environment.
