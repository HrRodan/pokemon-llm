## Identity & Utility
**Roto-Prize-Money** is a **Rotom Power** (special consumable) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** One of the unique "Rotom Powers" obtained via the Rotom Dex's Roto Loto feature in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. It is a consumable field item used to significantly boost financial gains from Trainer battles. It cannot be bought or sold at traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired exclusively through the Roto Loto mechanic).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated, it triples (3x) the amount of prize money received after winning a battle against an NPC Trainer. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a "Story/Playthrough" utility item. Rotom Powers are restricted to single-player gameplay and cannot be used in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item functions as a temporary buff. It stacks with the **Amulet Coin** or **Luck Incense** held by a participating Pokémon, as well as the **Happy Hour** move, allowing for massive exponential increases in money farming.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in the overworld or shops. It is earned by interacting with the **Rotom Dex** on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS. When Rotom's eyes flash gold, the player can play the "Roto Loto" to receive a random Rotom Power, including Roto-Prize-Money.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only manifestation of the Rotom Dex's bond with the Trainer, similar to the O-Powers found in Generation VI.
