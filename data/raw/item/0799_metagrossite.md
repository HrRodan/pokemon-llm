## Identity & Utility
**Metagrossite** is a **Mega Stone** (Competitive Held Item) introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*), though categorized under Generation VII in current data repositories for Alola-based availability.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to be held by a Metagross. It facilitates Mega Evolution when the Trainer possesses a Mega Bracelet or Z-Power Ring. It is a **Held Item** that **Cannot** be purchased at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; typically obtained through story events or Battle Point exchanges).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Metagross, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** during a battle. This transformation significantly increases Metagross's base stats (notably Attack, Defense, and Speed) and changes its ability to **Tough Claws**, which boosts the power of contact moves by 30%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but generally discouraged as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the encounter).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/Top-Tier Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as ORAS or SM/USUM OU and BSS), Mega Metagross is a premier physical sweeper. Its increased speed tier and the Tough Claws boost to moves like *Iron Head*, *Zen Headbutt*, and *Ice Punch* make it a centralizing threat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to the Metagross line. It cannot be consumed, nor can it be removed or stolen via *Knock Off* or *Thief* once the Pokémon has Mega Evolved. It bypasses the effects of the **Klutz** ability regarding the actual Mega Evolution trigger.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Hoenn (ORAS):** Gifted by Steven Stone after the Primal Groudon/Kyogre event.
    * **Alola (SM/USUM):** Purchased at the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP or obtained via special distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a unique "Key-style" Held Item.
* **Lore:** Representing the bond between a Trainer and Metagross, this stone reacts to the "Core" of the Metagross, allowing it to achieve a state of permanent calculation and overwhelming physical power. It is most famously associated with the Hoenn Champion, **Steven Stone**.
