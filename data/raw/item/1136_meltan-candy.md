## Identity & Utility
**Meltan Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized, high-energy consumable used to augment the growth of the Meltan evolutionary line. Unlike standard stat-specific candies (like Health Candy), this item is species-restricted. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be traditionally purchased in shops, though it has a nominal resale value.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard resale value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Meltan** or **Melmetal**, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed) simultaneously by +1 **Awakening Value (AV)**. This is the most efficient way to reach the +200 AV cap in every stat category.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and exists only in the "Candy Jar" or Medicine pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** Within the **LGPE (Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee)** competitive formats, Meltan Candy is essential for "No-Restrictions" or "Max AV" battles. In standard VGC or Smogon tiers for later generations, this mechanic is obsolete as AVs were replaced by the return of the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While its primary use is stat boosting, in the context of the broader Pokémon ecosystem (specifically *Pokémon GO*), Meltan Candy is also the requirement for evolution; however, in the *Let's Go* console games, it functions strictly as a stat enhancer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts. It is acquired through specific gameplay loops:
    1. **Catching Meltan:** Successfully capturing Meltan (usually via the Mystery Box).
    2. **Transferring:** Sending Meltan to Professor Oak in the GO Park.
    3. **Strolling:** Using the Poké Ball Plus peripheral to take a Meltan for a "stroll" in the real world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is exclusively a reward for catching or managing the Meltan species. It serves as a bridge between *Pokémon GO* mechanics and console RPG growth systems.
