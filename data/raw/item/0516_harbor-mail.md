## Identity & Utility
**Harbor Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a stylized Wingull print, designed to be held by a Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Social Item** that is widely available for purchase in specific seaside regions.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message using a predetermined set of words and phrases. The message is attached to a Pokémon, which can then be traded to another player to deliver the note. Once the recipient reads the mail, they can choose to store it in their PC or erase the message to make the item reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Item Protection:** While a Pokémon is holding Harbor Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC Storage System**. Furthermore, any move that attempts to forcibly remove, steal, or swap the item—such as **Thief, Covet, Knock Off, Trick, or Switcheroo**—will automatically fail. 
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically used as a niche "sticky" item in early-generation competitive play to prevent a Pokémon from losing its item or being crippled by a Choice Scarf via Trick. However, it offers no stat boosts or recovery, making it strictly utility-based.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the trading system and the mail storage interface in the PC.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Poké Marts in port cities, most notably **Slateport City** and **Lilycove City** in the Hoenn region. It is often required for specific in-game NPC trades or side quests involving the delivery of messages.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from vendors or obtained from NPCs.
* **Lore context:** The Wingull motif reflects its association with the sea and the delivery of messages, mirroring Wingull's real-world inspiration as a messenger bird (seagull). In generations following Gen V, Mail items were largely phased out and replaced by more direct communication features.
