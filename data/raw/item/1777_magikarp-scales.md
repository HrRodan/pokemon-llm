## Identity & Utility
**Magikarp Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Magikarp evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine). It cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a small amount of League Points (LP) or Poké Dollars.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Common Resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific reagent for crafting Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. Players combine these scales with League Points to create reusable move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is strictly **functional/extrinsic**, providing the means to teach competitive moves to a team via the crafting system rather than being used in battle itself.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting currency. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Magikarp** or **Gyarados**. They are abundant in aquatic biomes, particularly lakes, rivers, and oceans.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" (it does not occupy a Pokémon's item slot in the wild), it is a guaranteed drop upon the defeat of wild Magikarp. It is one of the most easily farmed materials in the game due to Magikarp's high spawn rate and low difficulty.
* **Crafting Context:** In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, these scales are notably required to craft TMs such as **TM077 (Waterfall)** and **TM154 (Hydro Pump)**, reflecting the powerful water-type moves associated with Magikarp’s evolved form, Gyarados.
