## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (★Aur1577)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. It is a single-use mission trigger that causes a specific powerful Pokémon to appear in a Max Raid Battle. It cannot be bought through standard gameplay channels.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; practically **Not for sale** as it is a promotional item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (Ruins of Watchtower), it initiates a specific Max Raid Battle. This particular crystal (★Aur1577) is programmed to summon **Gigantamax Corviknight**. The raid remains active until the end of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for the overworld/catch mechanics. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess **Hidden Abilities** or high **Individual Values (IVs)**, which are essential for breeding competitive-ready teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **Special Distribution Item**. Specifically, ★Aur1577 was distributed via serial codes included in promotional bundles, such as the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack* or specific retail collaborations (like CoroCoro or Amazon).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only event distribution item that does not exist in the standard encounter pool.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals were Galar's method of providing "Event Encounters," allowing players to face specific Gigantamax forms early in the game or outside of standard den rotations.
