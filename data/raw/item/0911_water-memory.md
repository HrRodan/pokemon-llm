## Identity & Utility
**Water Memory** is a **Memory** (specialized held item) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized memory disc containing Water-type data. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for use by Silvally. While it has a listed cost, it is typically treated as a unique piece of equipment provided to the player during the story rather than a standard shop item.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Relatively cheap, though generally acquired through special NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by the Pokémon **Silvally**, it changes Silvally's type to **Water**. It also changes the type of Silvally's signature move, **Multi-Attack**, to Water.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard damage, no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. In competitive play (such as Smogon's lower tiers), Silvally-Water is utilized as a bulky utility pivot. The Water typing grants it fewer weaknesses and resistances to common Fire, Ice, and Steel moves. However, because it must hold this item to change type, it cannot utilize defensive items like Leftovers or offensive items like Life Orb.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with the **RKS System** ability. If the holder is not Silvally, or if the ability is suppressed/lost, the item provides no benefit. It does not trigger evolution for Type: Null; rather, it is used after Type: Null has already evolved into Silvally via high friendship.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most games, the Water Memory is obtained as part of a set of 17 memories. 
    * In **Sun/Moon/USUM**, it is gifted to the player by **Gladion** at Aether Paradise after the main story.
    * In **Sword/Shield**, it is given by an NPC in the **Battle Tower** after the player receives a Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a synthetic technological item created by the Aether Foundation to stabilize the "Beast Killer" project.
