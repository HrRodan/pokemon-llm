## Identity & Utility
**TR42 (Hyper Voice)** is a **Technical Record (TR)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Hyper Voice**, a powerful sound-based attack. Unlike the TMs of its generation, this Technical Record is a **Consumable** item that breaks after a single use. 
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for Watts (W) at Wild Area Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hyper Voice** (Normal-type, Special, 90 Power, 100 Accuracy). This move targets all adjacent opponents in double battles and—crucially—**bypasses the move Substitute** because it is sound-based.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output if thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** Hyper Voice is a premier Special Normal-type STAB move. It is historically significant for Pokémon with "-ate" abilities (like **Sylveon** with Pixilate) which convert the move to Fairy-type and boost its power. It is also a core move for **Toxtricity** due to its *Punk Rock* ability, which increases the damage of sound-based moves by 30%.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with sound-related abilities. It is completely nullified by the **Soundproof** ability but receives significant damage buffs from the **Punk Rock** ability and the **Liquid Voice** ability (which converts it to a Water-type move).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR42 is primarily acquired through **Max Raid Battles** in the Galar region, specifically by defeating Normal-type Dynamax Pokémon. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area on a rotating daily stock.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly a reward for Raid participation or specialized commerce in the Galar region. It represents a more "fragile" form of technical knowledge compared to the reusable TM (Technical Machine) format.
