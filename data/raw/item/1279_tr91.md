## Identity & Utility
**TR91** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. Unlike the TMs of its generation, TRs break after a single application. This specific record teaches the move **Venom Drench**.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible). While it has a standard currency value, it is primarily traded via Watts (W) in its debut region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Venom Drench** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Logic:** Venom Drench is a Poison-type status move that targets all adjacent opponents. It only functions if the target is already afflicted with the **Poison** or **Badly Poisoned** status condition. Upon success, it lowers the target's **Attack, Special Attack, and Speed** stats by one stage each.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low; provides negligible utility when thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** While the stat drops are significant (-3 total stages), the requirement for the target to be poisoned makes it difficult to execute. It sees occasional play in "stall" or "hazard" compositions involving Toxic Spikes, but is generally considered too slow for high-level VGC or Smogon formats compared to direct offensive pressure.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR91 is typically obtained by defeating Poison-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts (usually 2,000–3,000 W). It can also be generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it must be earned through Raid progression or currency exchange.
* **Lore Context:** TRs represent a return to the classic "consumable" nature of TMs from earlier generations, containing more powerful or specialized moves than the standard infinite-use TMs of the Galar region.
