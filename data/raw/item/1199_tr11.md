## Identity & Utility
**TR11 (Psychic)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Psychic**, a powerful telekinetic attack that has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage. It is a **single-use consumable machine**, distinguishing it from the infinite-use Technical Machines (TMs) found in the same generation.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value for resale, it is primarily traded via Watts (W) in its debut region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic** (Power: 90, Accuracy: 100%, Special). This is the definitive Psychic-type Special move for most competitive builds.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage if used with the move Fling, though generally discouraged due to the item's rarity and single-use nature).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High / Essential.** Psychic is a staple move in both VGC and Smogon formats. It provides consistent, high-accuracy STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage for prominent Special Attackers such as Alakazam, Mewtwo, Gardevoir, and Hatterene. It is often preferred over Psyshock when the user needs to maximize raw damage against physically defensive walls.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. As a TR, it is consumed upon use and cannot be reused unless another copy is acquired.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR11 is most commonly acquired by defeating Psychic-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–8,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered through Raid rewards or the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion (requiring specific Psychic-type input combinations).
