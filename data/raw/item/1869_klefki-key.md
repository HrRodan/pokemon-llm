## Identity & Utility
**Klefki Key** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting material dropped by the Pokémon Klefki. In the context of the Paldea region's ecosystem, it represents a resource used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various TMs. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but is primarily used for crafting.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common Crafting Component**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient in the crafting of specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items for their team.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no utility in a competitive match, it is essential for **Teambuilding**. It is required to craft specific moves that Klefki or other Pokémon might need to be viable in VGC or Smogon tiers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource associated with the Klefki evolutionary line.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching a wild **Klefki**. It is found in areas where Klefki naturally spawns, such as the ruins or mountainous regions of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a traditional "Held Item" found on wild Pokémon during battle; rather, it is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is part of the Gen IX crafting loop designed to encourage exploration and battling a variety of wild species.
