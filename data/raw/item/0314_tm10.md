## Identity & Utility
**TM10** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation III** (with historical roots in Generation I).
* **Description:** A data-disc used to teach a Pokémon a permanent move. Historically, TM10 is most famous for teaching **Hidden Power**, a move whose elemental type is determined by the Pokémon's individual potential (IVs). It is a teaching tool that, depending on the specific game generation, is either consumed upon use or remains in the bag for infinite uses.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Accessible/Mid-range).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hidden Power** to a compatible Pokémon. In the original Generation I games, this TM taught **Double-Edge**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs typically cannot be used with the move Fling or have no base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Staple (Pre-Gen VIII).** Hidden Power was a defining mechanic in competitive singles (Smogon) and doubles (VGC) for decades. It allowed Pokémon to gain coverage types they lacked naturally—most notably **Hidden Power [Ice]** to hit 4x weaknesses on Ground/Dragon types or **Hidden Power [Fire]** for Grass-types to hit Steel-type switch-ins. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** TM10 has one of the widest compatibility rates in the franchise; almost every Pokémon capable of learning TMs can learn Hidden Power, making it a universal utility move.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in large Department Stores (e.g., Celadon City, Lilycove City) or provided by specialized NPCs who "read" a Pokémon's hidden talent. In many regions, it is a reward for exploration or solving minor riddles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; acquisition is limited to overworld item locations, NPC gifts, or Mart purchases. 
* **Historical Shift:** While the JSON identifies its primary effect as Hidden Power, it notes the Generation I variant taught **Double-Edge**, a high-recoil Normal-type physical move. From Generation II through Generation VII, TM10 was the definitive source for Hidden Power before the move was largely retired in recent generations.
