## Identity & Utility
**Sweet Apple** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar, exceptionally sweet apple used to trigger the evolution of specific Pokémon species. It is a **Consumable** item that, while having a defined internal cost, is often treated as a version-exclusive specialty item.
* **Cost:** 2,200 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Acquisition Cost**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a compatible Pokémon, it triggers an immediate evolution. Specifically, it is the unique catalyst required to evolve **Applin into Appletun**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effects upon hitting the target).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no competitive utility as a held item**. Its value is strictly relegated to the "Team Building" phase of competitive play, allowing trainers to access Appletun—a Pokémon known for its bulk and the "Thick Fat" ability, which is often utilized in specialized defensive cores or Trick Room archetypes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the direct counterpart to the **Tart Apple** (which evolves Applin into Flapple). It is consumed upon successful evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Galar), the Sweet Apple is a **version-exclusive** item to *Pokémon Shield*. It is typically obtained from an NPC in Hammerlocke or found as a repeatable "hidden item" in the Wild Area (specifically Axew's Eye). In later generations or opposing versions, it is usually acquired through specialized Delibird Presents shops or high-tier Tera Raid Battle rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not known to be held** by wild Pokémon. Unlike items like the Lucky Egg or Everstone, it cannot be reliably farmed via the **Pickup** ability or "Thief" tactics, making manual collection or trading essential for Pokémon Sword players.
