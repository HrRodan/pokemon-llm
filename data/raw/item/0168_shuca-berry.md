## Identity & Utility
**Shuca Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A consumable held item that reduces incoming damage from a specific elemental threat. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically priced but rarely found in standard Poké Marts, usually obtained through cultivation or wild encounters.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily acquired via gardening or foraging).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it is consumed to **halve the damage** taken from a single **super-effective Ground-type attack**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally not recommended for Fling unless desperate to trigger a specific berry-related ability on a teammate).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Fire-type** attack with **80 Base Power** (Gen 6+).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple** for Pokémon with a crippling 4x or 2x weakness to Ground (such as Heatran, Magnezone, Metagross, or Toxtricity). It allows these Pokémon to survive a predicted Earthquake or Earth Power to retaliate or set up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Harvest** (allowing the berry to be consumed multiple times) and **Unnerve** (which prevents the opponent from eating it).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in Berry patches throughout the Sinnoh, Johto (remakes), and Kalos regions. In many games, it is obtained by trading specific berries with NPCs or as a prize in Battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Ponyta** and **Rapidash**. These can be efficiently farmed using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet**.
* **Lore:** Like most type-reducing berries, the Shuca Berry is often described in-world as having a flavor profile that corresponds to its natural resistance, often used by trainers to bridge the defensive gaps in Fire and Electric-type Pokémon.
