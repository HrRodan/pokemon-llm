## Identity & Utility
**Silicobra Sand** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material consisting of fine sand collected from the Silicobra evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for competitive benefit. It is primarily managed within the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the TM Machine to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). It is combined with League Points (LP) to synthesize move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Utility Only).** This item has no direct impact on battle stats or mechanics. Its value is strictly preparation-based, allowing trainers to teach powerful Ground-type and hazard-setting moves to their roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource dropped by the Silicobra line (Silicobra and Sandaconda) upon their defeat or capture in the wild.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea region** (and associated DLC areas). It is granted automatically after battling wild Silicobra or Sandaconda.
* **Wild Drops:** Commonly gathered by hunting **Silicobra** and **Sandaconda** in arid environments like the Asado Desert. Unlike traditional held items, these are "drops" that occur 100% of the time upon victory/capture, making them easily farmable for players looking to mass-produce TMs such as **TM051 (Sandstorm)**, **TM116 (Stealth Rock)**, or **TM149 (Earthquake)**.
* **World Knowledge:** As a Gen IX material, it represents the shift toward a crafting-based economy for move acquisition, moving away from the infinite-use TMs of previous generations.
