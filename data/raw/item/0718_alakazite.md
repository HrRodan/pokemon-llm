## Identity & Utility
**Alakazite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized stone that reacts with a Trainer's Mega Ring/Bracelet. When held by an Alakazam, it triggers Mega Evolution during battle, drastically augmenting its psychic capabilities. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by an Alakazam, the Pokémon can undergo **Mega Evolution**, transforming into **Mega Alakazam**. This process increases its base stats (primarily Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) and changes its Ability to **Trace**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: Flinging a Mega Stone is generally counter-productive as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Mega Alakazam is a premier "glass cannon" special sweeper. In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (such as Gen 7 OU or NatDex), Alakazite is essential for leveraging Alakazam's 150 Base Speed and 175 Base Special Attack. Its ability to "Trace" opponent abilities like Intimidate or Swift Swim adds significant utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to the Alakazam line. It does not trigger a permanent evolution; the transformation is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the battle. It is unaffected by effects that remove held items (like Knock Off or Thief) once Mega Evolution has occurred.

## Acquisition & Lore
