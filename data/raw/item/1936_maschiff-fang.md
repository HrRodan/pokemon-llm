## Identity & Utility
**Maschiff Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Maschiff evolutionary line. It represents a piece of the Pokémon used in the Paldean synthesis process at the Technical Machine Machine. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be bought directly from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Basic Material**). While it has a low sell value, its primary worth lies in its utility as a reagent for move acquisition.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as a currency/component at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers in the Paldea region. It is required to craft specific TMs (Technical Machines) that grant Pokémon new moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While the item itself has no presence in VGC or Smogon tiers, it is essential for the "Teambuilding" phase. It is a prerequisite for crafting competitive staples—most notably **TM006 (Scary Face)** and **TM108 (Crunch)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM synthesis mechanic. It is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Maschiff** or **Mabosstiff**. It can also be found as shimmering pickups on the ground in areas where these Pokémon reside, such as the **South Province (Areas Two and Four)** and **West Province (Area Three)**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; rather, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop rewarded upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Maschiff line. It is a core part of the Gen IX ecosystem, encouraging players to interact with the local wildlife to expand their tactical move options.
