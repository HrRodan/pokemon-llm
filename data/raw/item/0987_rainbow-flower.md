## Identity & Utility
**Rainbow Flower** is a **Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A symbolic item crafted from seven distinct colored petals collected from various Trial Captains across the Alola region. It serves as a physical manifestation of a Trainer’s growth and the recognition they have earned from the region's top mentors. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Quest Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Rainbow Flower acts as the objective for Mina’s Trial on Poni Island. Once the player collects the Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet petals from the respective Trial Captains and Kahunas, the flower is assembled. Presenting the completed Rainbow Flower to Mina triggers the final stage of the trial: the battle against the **Totem Pokémon Ribombee**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-essential progression item used exclusively within the single-player campaign of the Alola region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not facilitate evolution. Its primary interaction is with the NPC **Mina** and serves as a gatekeeper for completing the Island Challenge.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained only in **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is received from Mina during her trial after the player successfully defeats or meets with the various Captains (such as Ilima, Mallow, Lana, Sophocles, and Kiawe) to gather their petals.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** Unlike traditional Gym Badges, the Rainbow Flower represents the interconnectedness of the Alola trials, requiring the player to revisit mentors from across the islands to prove their mastery before facing the final Totem of Poni Island.
