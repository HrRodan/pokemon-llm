## Identity & Utility
**Tough Candy** is a **Vitamin** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutrient packed with energy used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's physical resilience. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be purchased, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay loops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon’s **Defense stat** by 1 point. In the *Let's Go* series, this contributes to **Awakened Values (AVs)** rather than traditional Effort Values (EVs). It can be used until the Pokémon has gained 50 AVs in the Defense stat; beyond this, higher-tier candies (Tough Candy L or XL) are required.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine where holding items and the move Fling are not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Exclusive.** It is a core mechanic for "No Restrictions" battles in the *Let's Go* ecosystem but has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats (which utilize the traditional EV system).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of a tiered hierarchy: **Tough Candy** (Basic) < **Tough Candy L** (Level 30+) < **Tough Candy XL** (Level 60+).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at Pokémon Marts for a low cost, but most efficiently obtained by **transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer when they "release" or transfer Defense-oriented species (such as **Geodude**, **Onix**, or **Sandshrew**) to the Professor, reflecting the extraction of the Pokémon's inherent physical toughness into a consumable form.
