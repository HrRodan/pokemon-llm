## Identity & Utility
**TR33 (Shadow Ball)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach the move **Shadow Ball** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in Generation VIII, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use, functioning similarly to classic single-use TMs from earlier generations. 
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive). In its home region of Galar, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Shadow Ball**. Shadow Ball is a powerful Special Ghost-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 20% secondary chance to lower the target's Special Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Essential.** Shadow Ball is the gold standard for Special Ghost-type coverage. It is a staple on iconic Pokémon like Gengar, Dragapult, and Flutter Mane due to its reliability and the fact that Ghost is one of the best offensive types in the current meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, including most Ghost, Psychic, and Poison types, as well as many "dark" or "mystical" themed Pokémon across other types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, TR33 is acquired primarily through **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (stock rotates daily) or as a reward for defeating Ghost-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be crafted using the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically distributed as a reward for high-level training or raid encounters, reflecting its status as a high-tier offensive move.
