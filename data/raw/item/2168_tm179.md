## Identity & Utility
**TM179 (Smack Down)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Smack Down**. In the context of Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Poke Marts; requires **800 LP** and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Smack Down**, a Rock-type Physical move.
    * **Move Power:** 50
    * **Accuracy:** 100%
    * **Secondary Effect:** If the target is a Flying-type, has the Levitate ability, or is under the effects of Magnet Rise/Telekinesis, this move "smacks" them to the ground. The target loses its immunity to Ground-type moves and becomes vulnerable to Arena Trap.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be Flung in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** In VGC and Double Battles, Smack Down is a powerful utility tool used to bypass the Ground-type immunities of common threats (like Rotom-Wash, Zapdos, or Cresselia), allowing a partner Pokémon to sweep with moves like Earthquake or High Horsepower.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Levitate** ability and the **Flying** type by negating their inherent ground-based immunities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available in the **Paldea** region and the **Land of Kitakami**. It is obtained either through exploration (finding the yellow TM capsule in the overworld) or by crafting at the TM Machine found at any Pokémon Center.
* **Crafting Ingredients:** To manufacture TM179, a trainer requires:
    1. **800 LP** (League Points)
    2. **3x Nacli Salt**
    3. **3x Bonsly Tears**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; materials required to create it are gathered from wild **Nacli** and **Bonsly** evolutionary lines.
