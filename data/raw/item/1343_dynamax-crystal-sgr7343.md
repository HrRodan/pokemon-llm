## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR7343** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A single-use promotional item that activates a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that cannot be bought in-game via standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**; effectively priceless as it is distributed via serial codes and cannot be purchased traditionally).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Corviknight**—to appear as a Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no battle utility, the Pokémon caught through this raid often possess the **Gigantamax Factor** and high-individual values (IVs), making them highly desirable for competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** node and is consumed upon the successful spawning of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a **Limited-Time Event Item**. Dynamax Crystals with the "SGR" prefix were typically distributed via retail promotions (such as Amazon pre-order bonuses or specific magazine serial codes). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-exclusive inventory item.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a special, otherwise dormant Power Spot in Galar. Using a Dynamax Crystal "resonates" with the spot, forcing a specific Pokémon to Dynamax regardless of the natural Wishing Piece cycle.
