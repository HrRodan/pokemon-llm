## Identity & Utility
**Firium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is the bag-stored version of the Fire-type Z-Crystal. It converts Z-Power to upgrade a Pokémon's Fire-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique progression item obtained through story advancement.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Pokémon held-item version of this crystal is equipped by a teammate who knows a Fire-type move, it allows the use of the Fire-type Z-Move: **Inferno Overdrive**. 
    * If the base move is a **physical or special** attack, Inferno Overdrive deals massive damage based on the power of the original move.
    * If the base move is a **status** move, it grants a specific **Z-Power effect** (e.g., Z-Will-O-Wisp raises Attack, Z-Sunny Day raises Speed) in addition to the move's standard effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Impact (Gen VII Context).** In the Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon competitive eras, Z-Crystals were meta-defining. Firium Z was commonly used on offensive Fire types like Volcarona, Heatran, or Blacephalon to bypass traditional counters with a high-damage "nuke."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not consumed upon use. It does not evolve any Pokémon, but it is required for the player to access the Fire-type Z-Move mechanic. It cannot be removed from a Pokémon in battle by moves like Knock Off or Thief.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Alola region, the Firium Z is obtained at **Wela Volcano Park** on Akala Island. It is typically awarded to the player after defeating the Totem Pokémon (Totem Salazzle in Sun/Moon or Totem Marowak in Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon) during Kiawe’s trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact granted to Trainers who complete the Island Challenge. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
