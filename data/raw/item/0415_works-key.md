## Identity & Utility
**Works Key** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** A large mechanical key specifically designed to operate the heavy doors of the Valley Windworks facility located in the canyon near Floaroma Town. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to the interior of the **Valley Windworks**. It is used to unlock the front door, which is initially locked by Team Galactic to prevent interference with their energy-theft operations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld progression and has no mechanical application in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a narrative tool used to advance the player's confrontation with **Commander Mars** of Team Galactic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a mandatory story drop in **Floaroma Meadow**. The player must defeat two Team Galactic Grunts who are harassing an NPC; upon their defeat, they drop the key while fleeing.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. In the lore, it was exclusively held by a **Team Galactic Grunt** before being recovered by the player.
* **Context:** In the Sinnoh games (*Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Brilliant Diamond, and Shining Pearl*), obtaining this key is the only way to rescue the manager of the Windworks and subsequently trigger the weekly appearance of **Drifloon** (which appears every Friday outside the building once the area is cleared).
