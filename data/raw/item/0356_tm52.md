## Identity & Utility
**TM52** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Historically associated with the move **Focus Blast**, though in specific iterations like *Sword & Shield*, it teaches the move **Bounce**. It is a single-use or multi-use machine depending on the generation, characterized by its extremely high retail value.
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (Extremely Expensive/Luxury Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Focus Blast (Primary):** A powerful Fighting-type Special attack with 120 Base Power and 70% Accuracy. It may also lower the target's Special Defense.
    * **Bounce (SwSh Context):** A Flying-type Physical move where the user attacks on the second turn, carrying a 30% chance to paralyze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact Staple.** Focus Blast is a mandatory coverage move for many Special Attackers (such as Gengar, Alakazam, and Mewtwo) to deal with Steel, Dark, and Normal-type walls (e.g., Ferrothorn, Tyranitar, Blissey). Due to its 70% accuracy, it is colloquially known in the competitive community as "Focus Miss," representing a high-risk, high-reward tactical choice.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, particularly those with high Special Attack or those capable of utilizing "Special" Fighting-type coverage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in late-game locations or high-end retail hubs. In many regions, it is purchasable at large Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City, Goldenrod City, or Celadon City). In the Paldea region (Scarlet/Violet), it is crafted using the TM Machine or purchased with League Points (LP).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a man-made technological device. Acquisition is restricted to overworld exploration, gym leader rewards, or high-cost purchasing.
