## Identity & Utility
**HM03 (Surf)** is an **Essential Field Machine** introduced in **Generation I** (though listed under Generation III in this specific metadata).
* **Description:** This item is used to teach the Move "Surf" to compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in older generations, HMs are traditionally infinite-use and represent critical progression milestones. It is a **Key Utility Item** that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item/Special Acquisition**). It cannot be purchased in Poké Marts and must be obtained through story progression.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Surf** to a compatible Pokémon. Surf is a high-tier Water-type special attack with a base power of 90 (95 in earlier generations) and 100% accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** While "Scald" is often preferred for its burn chance and "Hydro Pump" for raw power, Surf is the gold standard for reliable Water-type damage. In Doubles/VGC, it is notable for hitting all adjacent Pokémon (including allies), often paired with "Water Absorb" or "Storm Drain" abilities for strategic synergy.
* **Overworld Interaction:**
    * **Field Move:** This is a core navigation tool. When taught to a Pokémon, it allows the player to travel across water tiles (oceans, lakes, rivers).
    * **Progression Lock:** In most games, use of this item in the overworld is restricted until a specific Gym Badge is acquired (e.g., the Soul Badge in Kanto or the Balance Badge in Hoenn).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquisition is region-dependent but always tied to significant NPCs or locations. 
    * **Kanto:** Found in the Secret House of the Safari Zone.
    * **Johto:** Gifted by a traveler in Ecruteak City after defeating the Kimono Girls.
    * **Hoenn:** Gifted by Wally's father in Petalburg City after defeating Gym Leader Norman.
    * **Sinnoh:** Gifted by Cynthia's grandmother in Celestic Town.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item (in games where HMs are physical items) or a permanent unlock in modern titles.
* **Historical Context:** In earlier generations (I-VI), moves taught by HMs were notoriously difficult to "unlearn," requiring a specific NPC known as the **Move Deleter**. This was to prevent players from becoming stranded in areas requiring Surf to exit.
