## Identity & Utility
**Fairy Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar, shimmering shard of crystallized energy that radiates a pinkish hue. It is a **Consumable/Special Currency** item used to manipulate the Terastal phenomenon. While it can be sold at marts, its primary value lies in its use as a crafting and transformation resource.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**; however, it is far more valuable as a resource than as a source of income).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Fairy Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to Fairy. This consumes the shards in the process.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Impact.** The Fairy type is arguably the strongest defensive type in the competitive circuit (VGC/Smogon) due to its immunity to Dragon-type moves and resistance to Fighting, Bug, and Dark. It is frequently used on defensive pivots (like Garganacl or Skeledirge) to flip their weaknesses or on offensive threats to gain STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) on powerful Fairy-type moves like Moonblast or Play Rough.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a mechanic-altering item related to the **Terastal** system. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup but is essential for optimizing "Tera Blast" coverage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for defeating **Fairy-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star raids and higher). They can also be found as glowing "sparkle" item drops in the overworld (notably in **Area Zero**), rewarded by the Academy Ace Tournament, or obtained via the Item Printer in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is tied strictly to raid participation and regional exploration rather than traditional farming or the **Pickup** ability.
