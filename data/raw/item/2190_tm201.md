## Identity & Utility
**TM201 (Misty Explosion)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This Technical Machine allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Misty Explosion**. In the modern Paldean ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be replicated using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is measured in League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials required for crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Misty Explosion**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Special Fairy-type move with 100 Base Power. The user faints immediately upon use. If **Misty Terrain** is active, the move's power is increased by 1.5x (reaching 150 Base Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be effectively used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / High-Risk.** Misty Explosion is primarily used in competitive Doubles (VGC) as a "suicide lead" mechanic. It allows a player to deal massive Fairy-type damage while voluntarily fainting to bring in a powerful sweeper safely. It is most effective when paired with Pokémon that can set Misty Terrain (like Galarian Weezing or Tapu Fini in older formats).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. The move it teaches is completely negated by the ability **Damp**, which prevents all self-destructing moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item in the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy) during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. Once obtained, it can be crafted at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To craft TM201, a trainer typically requires:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Flabébé Pollen**
    * **3x Cleffa Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; TMs in the Paldea region are exclusively found as overworld pickups or rewards for battle milestones.
