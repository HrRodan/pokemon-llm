## Identity & Utility
**Cleanse Tag** is a Training and Utility item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by the lead Pokémon in the party. It acts as a spiritual ward that lowers the encounter rate of wild Pokémon, provided the holder is at a higher level than the local wildlife. It is a **Held Item** that serves as a permanent, non-consumable alternative to Repels.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**). While it has a high purchase price in some games, it is often found as a unique treasure in spiritual locations (like Mt. Pyre or the Lost Tower).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by the Pokémon at the front of the party, it prevents encounters with wild Pokémon that have a lower level than the holder. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no combat-relevant stats or effects and is used exclusively for overworld navigation and avoiding unwanted battles during travel or "Nuzlocke" routing.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of the few items categorized under "Training" that functions as a passive exploration tool rather than an experience or stat modifier.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in locations associated with Ghost-type Pokémon or memorial sites (e.g., Mt. Pyre in Hoenn, Lost Tower in Sinnoh). It can be purchased at specialized shops or the Pokémon League in certain regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is rarely found in the wild, held by Pokémon with spiritual themes:
    * **Chingling** and **Chimecho** (5% chance to be holding this item when encountered).
* **Lore Context:** Modeled after *ofuda* (traditional Japanese paper charms), the Cleanse Tag is meant to "purify" the surrounding area, making it a thematic staple for players traversing high-encounter areas like caves or tall grass without wanting to expend resources on Repels.
