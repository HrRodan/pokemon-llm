## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Bike (Water Mode)** is a **Key Item / Mobility Tool** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized upgrade to the standard Rotom Bike that integrates the Pokémon Rotom into the frame. It allows the player to seamlessly transition from land to water travel. It is a **Key Item** and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While riding the bike, the player can travel across the surface of water bodies. Large tires or specialized Rotom-powered buoyancy allows for high-speed aquatic traversal, effectively replacing the "Surf" Hidden Machine (HM) functionality of previous generations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld navigation and exploration. It has no impact on competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon, but it is an essential progression tool for reaching specific areas where certain Pokémon (like Lapras or Dhelmise) can be encountered or where evolution-inducing items are hidden. It features a "Turbo Boost" mechanic (powered by Rotom) that temporarily increases travel speed on both land and water.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a mandatory story upgrade in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. The player receives this modification on **Route 9** from the same doctor who gave them the initial bike, after defeating Team Yell grunts harassing him.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of technology specific to the Galar region's infrastructure, combining human engineering with Rotom's ability to inhabit appliances. Unlike previous "Surfing" methods, it does not require a Pokémon in the party to know a specific move.
