## Identity & Utility
**Aerodactyl Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy treat. Unlike generic candies, it is specifically designed for the Aerodactyl evolutionary line. It is a consumable enhancement item used to bypass traditional training methods to directly bolster a Pokémon's power.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal; primarily traded for or earned rather than purchased in shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by an Aerodactyl, it increases **all six of its stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A in standard VGC or Smogon formats. However, in the *Let's Go* competitive meta, these candies are mandatory for "Maxed" format play, allowing an Aerodactyl to gain up to +200 in every stat, drastically increasing its bulk and offensive pressure.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Species Candy" mechanic which serves as the primary alternative to the Effort Value (EV) system in the Kanto-region remakes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase at Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired by **catching wild Aerodactyl**, transferring Aerodactyl to **Professor Oak**, or by walking with an Aerodactyl in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the trainer upon a successful capture (particularly during "Catch Combos") or as a reward for the "Go Park" transfers from *Pokémon GO*.
* **Lore Context:** This item represents a condensed form of the Pokémon's own essence/energy, used to instantly "awaken" its latent physical and special potential.
