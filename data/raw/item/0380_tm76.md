## Identity & Utility
**TM76 (Technical Machine 76)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. As a TM, its behavior varies by generation: in earlier titles, it is a single-use consumable, while in later titles (Gen V–VIII), it is typically reusable. The specific move contained within TM76 has historically changed across regions, ranging from the entry hazard **Stealth Rock** (Gen IV) to the sound-based **Round** (Gen VIII).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive; typically sold at Department Stores or specialized TM stalls).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. Based on the provided data and historical context:
    * **Stealth Rock (Gen IV):** Sets an entry hazard that damages opponents upon switching in based on their weakness to Rock-type attacks.
    * **Struggle Bug (Gen V-VI):** A Bug-type special attack that lowers the Special Attack stat of all hit targets.
    * **Round (Gen VIII):** A Normal-type special attack that increases in power if multiple Pokémon use it in the same turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in a meaningful way; power is typically 0 or the item is restricted).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Stealth Rock (Gen IV Identity):** A **Tier-0 Competitive Staple**. It is arguably the most important move in 6v6 singles, breaking Focus Sashes and punishing frequent switching.
        * **Struggle Bug (Gen V-VI Identity):** A niche utility move used in VGC (Doubles) to mitigate the damage of special attackers.
        * **Round (Gen VIII Identity):** A gimmick move used in specific "Round" core teams in Double Battles.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Diamond/Pearl/Platinum**, it is rewarded by the first Gym Leader, **Roark**, after his defeat in Oreburgh City, emphasizing its importance to early-game strategy. 
    * In later generations, it is commonly purchasable in large retail hubs like the **Celedon** or **Lilycove** Department Stores for 10,000 Poké Dollars.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM76 is never found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly a man-made device obtained via Gym Leaders, overworld pickups, or Mart purchases. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
