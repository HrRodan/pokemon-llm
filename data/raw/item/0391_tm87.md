## Identity & Utility
**TM87 (Technical Machine 87)** is an **all-machine** item introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** This item is a Technical Machine used to permanently teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. While historically associated with the move **Swagger** (Gen IV–VII), the provided data indicates that in the **Sword and Shield** era, it teaches **Draining Kiss**. It is a consumable or reusable teaching tool (depending on the specific game version) that is readily available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Historical Move (Swagger):** Confuses the target and raises its Attack stat by two stages.
    * **Current Move (Draining Kiss):** Deals Fairy-type damage; the user restores HP equal to roughly 75% of the damage dealt.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Swagger:** Historically part of the "SwagPlay" (Swagger + Foul Play) strategy, which was so effective it eventually led to Swagger being banned or restricted in various competitive tiers (Smogon) and nerfed in accuracy.
        * **Draining Kiss:** A staple for Fairy-type Pokémon with high Special Attack but low natural recovery, frequently seen on Pokémon like Comfey (due to Triage) or Enamorus.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in older generations but is infinite-use in certain middle generations. In Gen VIII (Sword/Shield), TMs are infinite-use, unlike TRs (Technical Records).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Department Stores (such as the Veilstone Department Store in Sinnoh) or distributed by NPCs. In newer generations, it can be purchased at Pokémon Centers or crafted at the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, TMs must be found as overworld loot or purchased from specialized vendors.
* **Context:** TM numbers are often re-assigned between generations. While the ID remains 391, the move it contains shifts to keep the TM list relevant to the current competitive Pokédex and move-pool balance.
