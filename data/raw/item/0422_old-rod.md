## Identity & Utility
**Old Rod** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (though this data entry originates from **Generation III**).
* **Description:** An old and beat-up fishing rod used by any body of water to encounter wild aquatic Pokémon. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**, serving as a mandatory progression tool for players wishing to access water-based encounters before obtaining surf-related HM/TMs.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used near a body of water (facing the water), it initiates a fishing mini-game. If successful, it triggers a wild encounter. The Old Rod is hardcoded to pull from a very limited encounter table, primarily yielding low-level Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in the Fling attack).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; it is exclusively a utility tool for the overworld and Pokédex completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The Old Rod is famously the primary method for catching **Magikarp**. While Magikarp itself is weak, the Old Rod is the foundational step for players to acquire its powerful evolution, **Gyarados**, early in a playthrough.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically gifted to the player by an NPC (often referred to as a "Fishing Guru" or "Fisherman") early in the game. In the Hoenn region (Gen III), it is obtained from a Fisherman in **Dewford Town**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique tool assigned to the player's Key Items pocket.
* **Utility Tier:** **Basic/Early-game.** It is the first in a hierarchy of fishing tools, followed by the **Good Rod** and the **Super Rod**. While the Old Rod has the lowest encounter variety, its reliability for catching Magikarp makes it a staple for Nuzlocke runs and casual playthroughs.
