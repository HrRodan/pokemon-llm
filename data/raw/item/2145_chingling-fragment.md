## Identity & Utility
**Chingling Fragment** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crafting reagent dropped by members of the Chingling evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that serves as a core component for the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) system. While it can be sold at Poké Marts, its primary value lies in move synthesis.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common Reagent**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient to craft TMs (Technical Machines). When combined with League Points (LP) and other materials at a TM Machine, it allows the player to "teach" specific moves to their Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used as a held item in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While it provides no benefit during a match, it is essential for competitive preparation. It allows players to craft high-value TMs to optimize Pokémon movepools for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of the **Chingling** and **Chimecho** species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Chingling** or **Chimecho**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; it is a **guaranteed or high-probability drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter with the species in the Paldea region or the Land of Kitakami. 
* **Lore Context:** TM Materials represent biological or elemental traces left behind by Pokémon. The Chingling Fragment likely represents a shard of the bell-like metallic body or the psychic resonance associated with the species. Finding these fragments is common in mountainous or cave biomes where Chingling congregate.
