## Identity & Utility
**Mirror Herb** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herb that allows the holder to mirror an opponent's improvements to its stats. Beyond its battle application, it serves as a revolutionary utility tool for Pokémon training, allowing for the instantaneous transfer of Egg Moves. It is a **consumable** held item (in battle) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In battle, if an opponent increases its stats (via moves like Dragon Dance, Swords Dance, or Quiver Dance), the holder consumes the Mirror Herb to gain the exact same stat increases. This effect triggers only once per battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Utility Niche.** It is primarily used as a counter-measure against "Set-up Sweepers." By copying the opponent's boosts, the holder can potentially out-speed or over-power the threat that just attempted to sweep.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Egg Move Transfer:** Outside of battle, the Mirror Herb has a unique "Breeding" mechanic. If a Pokémon with an empty move slot holds the Mirror Herb while in a Picnic with another Pokémon that knows an **Egg Move**, the holder will instantly learn that move, regardless of Egg Group. This bypasses the traditional multi-generational breeding process.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, the Mirror Herb is a high-end item exclusively sold at the **Delibird Presents** shop in **Cascarrafa**. Its high price point reflects its dual-purpose value in both professional circuit battling and specialized breeding.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon; it is a premium manufactured item intended for serious trainers.
