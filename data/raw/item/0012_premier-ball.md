## Identity & Utility
**Premier Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A commemorative item created to mark a special event. It functions as a standard capture device with a distinct aesthetic—featuring a signature white shell with a red trim. It is a **Consumable** item that is typically acquired as a bonus rather than through direct purchase in most regions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While the technical cost is low, it is rarely sold individually in standard Marts, serving more as a loyalty reward.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to catch a wild Pokémon with a **1.0x Catch Rate Modifier**. This makes it mechanically identical to a standard Poké Ball, offering no functional advantage in capture difficulty.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item lacks specific Fling power data in this record, though it generally possesses a base power of 30 in modern titles).
    * **Competitive Use:** Purely **Aesthetic**. In competitive VGC or Smogon formats, the Premier Ball is highly valued for the "prestige" and visual "sparkle" entrance animation it provides. It is a favorite among players for catching Shiny Pokémon or Legendaries to match a minimalist or "clean" team aesthetic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a capture and storage device.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically obtained at Poké Marts as a **bonus gift** for purchasing at least 10 Poké Balls in a single transaction. In some later regions (such as Kalos or Alola), they can be purchased individually at specialized Ball Boutiques or Thrifty Megamarts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily distributed through human commerce and manufacturing as a promotional item. In modern games, it is also the standard reward for completing **Tera Raids** (as Premier Balls or their variants) and **Max Raid Battles**.
