## Identity & Utility
**Pink Tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's picnic setup. It provides a visual overhaul to the picnic table, replacing the default cloth with a pink-themed design. It is a **Cosmetic Customization** item that can be bought at specialized retail locations.
* **Cost:** 5000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a Picnic, they can select this item from their inventory to change the table's appearance. It has no direct impact on Meal Powers, Egg Power, or the quality of sandwiches produced; its function is entirely aesthetic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is used exclusively in the overworld during the picnic mini-game and has no application in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle abilities. It is categorized under the "Picnic" sub-menu of the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available for purchase at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean hubs (such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). Unlike most hold items, it is a permanent addition to the player's customization options once purchased.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured commodity rather than a natural resource or held tool.
