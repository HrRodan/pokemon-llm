## Identity & Utility
**Revive** is a **Revival Medicine** introduced in **Generation I** (represented here via Generation III data).
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal spray or capsule used to return a fainted Pokémon to consciousness. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used both in the overworld and during active battle. It is a standard tier item, sitting between the Rare Candy/Sacred Ash and the more potent Max Revive.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard**). While expensive in the early game, it becomes a staple purchase for mid-to-late game exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon with 0 HP (Fainted status), it restores the Pokémon to life and heals **50% of its maximum HP**. It has no effect on Pokémon that are not fainted.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional effect when thrown via the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Staple.** In official competitive formats (VGC, Smogon, Battle Stadium), the use of items from the Bag is prohibited, rendering Revives non-viable. In "Nuzlocke" challenge runs, Revives are typically banned or highly restricted to maintain the "permadeath" mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is frequently categorized as an **Underground** item in the Sinnoh region, where it can be excavated as treasure.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at Pokémon Marts and Department Stores across all regions once the trainer has earned enough Gym Badges. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Zigzagoon**. Because Zigzagoon is a common user of the **Pickup** ability, Revives are frequently "farmed" by keeping a Zigzagoon in the party, as it can scavenge them from the ground after battles.
