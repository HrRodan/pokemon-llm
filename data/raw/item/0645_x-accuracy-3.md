## Identity & Utility
**X Accuracy 3** is a **Miracle Shooter (Battle Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized battle-only enhancement item that drastically boosts a Pokémon's precision. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that cannot be purchased with standard currency and is exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). It is "purchased" during active combat using points accumulated over turns in Wonder Launcher-enabled battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon during battle, it increases the target's **Accuracy stat by three stages**. This significantly mitigates the risk of missing high-power, low-accuracy moves (e.g., Zap Cannon, Dynamic Punch, or Blizzard).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Legacy.** This item was only available in the **Wonder Launcher** battle mode in Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2. It is not used in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as those formats generally prohibit the use of items from the bag. Within its specific niche, it is a high-tier support item for overcoming evasion-boosting opponents or guaranteeing hits for "glass cannon" attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Unlike standard X Items, which can be used from the bag in any trainer battle, X Accuracy 3 is restricted entirely to the Wonder Launcher interface. The effect is lost if the Pokémon switches out or the battle ends.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Not available in Poké Marts.** It is exclusively accessible within the **Wonder Launcher** sub-menu during multiplayer battles or specific NPC battles that enable the feature. Players must wait for their point gauge to fill to the required level to select this item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, making it one of the few consumable items entirely decoupled from the overworld economy.
