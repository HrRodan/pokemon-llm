## Identity & Utility
**Old Letter** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An item of sentimental and supernatural significance, it is a letter entrusted to the player by a young girl named Paula in Hammerlocke to be delivered to her friend Frank in Ballonlea. Its description notes that the letter appears strangely old, hinting at its ghostly origins. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Quest Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Old Letter serves exclusively as a quest objective. Once the player delivers it to Frank in Ballonlea, the quest is completed, providing narrative resolution and a reward (typically a Choice Scarf from the girl's spirit or found at the site afterward).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battle format; its value is strictly limited to the single-player story/side-quests.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any standard Pokémon abilities. It is purely a narrative tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained from a young girl standing near the vault in **Hammerlocke City**. After the player delivers the letter to Frank (an elderly man in Ballonlea who was the girl's childhood friend), the player can return to the girl's original location to find she has vanished, revealing her to have been a ghost.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-time acquisition per playthrough.
