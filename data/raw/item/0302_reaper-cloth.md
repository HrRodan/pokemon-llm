## Identity & Utility
**Reaper Cloth** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized cloth imbued with potent spiritual energy. It is specifically designed to interact with the Ghost-type Pokémon Dusclops. As an evolution item, it is consumed upon use during a trade. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought, though it is often restricted to specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Dusclops** during a trade, the spiritual energy of the cloth triggers an evolution, transforming the Pokémon into **Dusknoir**. The item is consumed once the evolution is complete.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no secondary status effects when thrown.
    * **Competitive Use:** None. The Reaper Cloth provides no passive stat boosts or tactical advantages in battle. Unlike the Eviolite (which Dusclops often prefers for competitive bulk), the Reaper Cloth is strictly a **Progression Item** used to reach a final evolution stage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Target:** Dusclops → Dusknoir.
    * **Mechanic:** Must be held during a Trade.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Sinnoh), it is typically found in late-game or post-game areas like **Route 229** or **Turnback Cave**. In later generations, it is frequently available via **Battle Points (BP)** at Battle Facilities (e.g., Battle Frontier, Battle Maison) or specialized "Bargain" shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. Unlike items like the King's Rock or Dragon Scale, players cannot easily farm this item via the **Pickup** ability or the move **Thief**; it must usually be found as a unique overworld item or purchased through high-tier currency.
* **Lore Context:** The "horrifyingly strong spiritual energy" mentioned in its flavor text suggests a deep connection to the underworld, fitting for a Pokémon like Dusknoir which is said to receive transmissions from the spirit world.
