## Identity & Utility
**Wailmer Pail** is a **Key Item** (categorized as Gameplay) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A tool shaped like a Wailmer used to provide hydration to Berry plants. It is a **Key Item** that is **cannot** be bought or sold; it is a permanent addition to the player's Bag upon acquisition. It functions as the Hoenn region's equivalent to the Squirtle Bottle or Psyduck Down.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a patch of soft soil where a Berry has been planted, it waters the plant. Regular watering prevents the soil from drying out, which is necessary to ensure the maximum yield of Berries upon harvest.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is strictly an overworld utility item. However, it is vital for "Berry Farming," allowing players to mass-produce competitive consumables such as Lum, Sitrus, and Type-resist Berries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Berry growth mechanic** and "Soft Soil" tiles found throughout the Hoenn region and subsequent games where it appears.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Hoenn), it is obtained at the **Pretty Petal Flower Shop** on Route 104. It is typically given to the player by a shop assistant to encourage the cultivation of Berries across the region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held** by wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool provided during the story or through specific NPCs to facilitate the player's progress in resource management.
* **Lore Context:** The item's design reflects the Pokémon Wailmer, known for its association with water. It serves as an early-game tutorial for the player to engage with the environment beyond simple combat.
