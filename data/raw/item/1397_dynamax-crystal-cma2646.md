## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CMA2646)** is a **Special Event Item** (categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use promotional item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the specified Pokémon—traditionally a Gigantamax-capable species—will appear in the den until the end of the day or until defeated. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this cost is a technical placeholder for event-exclusive items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) while possessing this crystal, it activates a **Max Raid Battle**. For the "CMA2646" variant, this typically results in an encounter with **Gigantamax Centiskorch** (or occasionally other promotional Pokémon depending on the specific retail distribution).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for acquisition/story-mode purposes, allowing players to catch Pokémon with Rare G-Max Factors or Hidden Abilities that are otherwise difficult to find.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly. However, it provides a guaranteed path to catching a Pokémon capable of **Gigantamaxing**, which is otherwise a rare RNG-dependent encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Codes** provided by retailers (such as Best Buy or GameStop) or during special promotional periods for Pokémon Sword and Shield. It is not available through Marts or in-game NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital "key" used to unlock a specific encounter and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or other item-farming methods.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique "inactive" den. Dynamax Crystals serve as high-energy catalysts that temporarily reactivate the den's Power Spot to summon a specific, powerful Dynamax signature.
