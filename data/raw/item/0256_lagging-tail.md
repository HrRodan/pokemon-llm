## Identity & Utility
**Lagging Tail** is a **Bad Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A tremendously heavy tail that significantly burdens the holder. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought, though it is categorized as a "bad" item due to its negative impact on the holder's turn order. Unlike items that reduce the Speed stat (like the Iron Ball), this item directly manipulates the move order priority.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The holder will always move **last** within its move’s priority bracket, regardless of its Speed stat or the effects of **Trick Room**. If multiple Pokémon are affected by a Lagging Tail or Full Incense within the same bracket, the Pokémon with the lower Speed stat actually moves first among that specific group.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While its effect is negative, it is a **Niche Strategic Item**. It is most commonly used in combination with the moves **Trick** or **Switcheroo** to force a fast opponent (like a Sweeper) to move last for the remainder of the battle. It is also used by Pokémon with moves that benefit from moving second, such as **Payback** or **Avalanche**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Stall Ability:** The holder will move after Pokémon with the Stall ability. If a Pokémon with Stall holds a Lagging Tail, the Stall ability is ignored in favor of the item's effect.
    * **Trick Room:** This item is one of the few ways to ensure a Pokémon moves last even when Trick Room is active, as it ignores the reversed speed dimensions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available in late-game department stores or specialized battle shops (like the Battle Frontier or BP shops in various regions).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature thematic item found on naturally slow or heavy Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Slowpoke**, **Lickitung**, and **Lickilicky** (a 5% chance in most games). Players often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the drop rate or **Pickup** at high levels to obtain them.
