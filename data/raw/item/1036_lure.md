## Identity & Utility
**Lure** is a **Field Consumable (Spelunking)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically debuting in the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A glass bottle of perfume that, when sprayed, makes rare Pokémon more likely to appear in the wild for a limited duration. It functions as the functional opposite of a Repel. It is a **Consumable** item that **can** be purchased at most retail locations after achieving specific milestones.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the overworld, it increases the spawn rate of all Pokémon, specifically boosting the appearance rate of rare spawns (such as Dragonite, Charizard, or Lapras in the wild). In the *Let's Go* series mechanics, it also provides a slight increase to the **Shiny Pokémon spawn rate** and lasts for **100 steps**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is strictly a field utility item used for completing the Pokédex, hunting for specific Natures, or Shiny hunting. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of a tiered hierarchy of lures: **Lure (100 steps)** < **Super Lure (200 steps)** < **Max Lure (300 steps)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available for purchase at **Poké Marts** and the Celadon Dept. Store once the player has earned at least two Gym Badges. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In the *Let's Go* games, it can occasionally be found as a hidden item in high-respawn areas like **Cerulean Cave**, often gathered by the player's following Pokémon or found in glittering floor spots.
* **Context:** Unlike Repels, which have existed since Generation I, the Lure was introduced to compliment the overworld spawn system of the Alola-era spin-offs, providing a mechanical way to influence the "spawn table" directly.
