## Identity & Utility
**N-Lunarizer (Split)** is a **Key Item** (Fusion Tool) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A high-tech machine specifically designed to undo the fusion between Necrozma and Lunala. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**, serving as a permanent tool in the player's inventory once acquired.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Dawn Wings Necrozma** (the fused form of Necrozma and Lunala), it separates the two Pokémon back into their original, individual forms. The player must have an empty slot in their party to accommodate the returning Lunala.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself isn't used *during* a battle, it is essential for team building. **Dawn Wings Necrozma** is a powerful restricted legendary in VGC and Smogon formats (Uber tier); this item allows players to toggle between the fused form and the base legendary forms to fit specific team compositions.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with **Necrozma** and **Lunala**. It acts as the "reversing" mechanism for the standard N-Lunarizer. It does not trigger evolution but manages "Forme" changes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Ultra Moon**, it is obtained alongside the N-Solarizer after capturing Necrozma at Mount Lanakila.
    * In later generations (Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), it is typically provided by special vendors (like the Stow-on-Side merchant or Porto Marinada auction) if the player has a Necrozma in their party or PC.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique device and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** The device represents the pinnacle of Alolan technology (often associated with the Aether Foundation or the Ultra Recon Squad) used to control and stabilize the volatile light-absorbing energy of Necrozma.
