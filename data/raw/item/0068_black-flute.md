## Identity & Utility
**Black Flute** is a **Spelunking** utility item introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A specialized flute crafted from black glass. It is a **consumable overworld utility** item that can be held by Pokémon, though it serves no passive benefit in battle. Despite its low nominal cost in the data, it is traditionally a specialty item rather than a standard Mart commodity.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically acquired through specialized crafting or trading).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the overworld, it **decreases the wild Pokémon encounter rate by 50%**. 
    * *Mechanical Note:* In later generations (specifically starting in Gen VI), the effect was modified in some contexts to instead increase the average level of wild Pokémon encountered by 1-4 levels, making it a tool for seeking "stronger" encounters rather than avoiding them entirely.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as its primary function is restricted to overworld exploration and encounter manipulation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several glass items (alongside the Blue, Red, Yellow, and White flutes) that interact with overworld spawn mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, the Black Flute is obtained at the **Glass Workshop on Route 113** in the Hoenn region. It is not purchased with currency but is instead crafted by an artisan in exchange for **1,000 steps** worth of accumulated **Volcanic Ash**. In later regions, it is occasionally found as a hidden item or gifted by NPCs in mountainous areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or certain hold items, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief** in standard gameplay loops; it remains a rare reward for exploration or specific quest completion.
