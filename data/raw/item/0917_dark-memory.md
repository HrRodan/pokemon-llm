## Identity & Utility
**Dark Memory** is a **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola Region).
* **Description:** A specialized memory disc containing Dark-type data. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for the Pokémon **Silvally**. Unlike consumable berries or medicines, this is a permanent equipment piece that triggers a physiological and elemental shift in the holder. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard specialty pricing).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with the **RKS System** ability (exclusively Silvally), the holder's primary type changes to **Dark**. Additionally, the base type of the move **Multi-Attack** changes to Dark to match the holder.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Specialized. The Dark Memory is mandatory for players wishing to utilize **Dark-type Silvally**. This type configuration is often chosen to provide Silvally with a powerful 120-BP Dark-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move via Multi-Attack, which is useful for checking Psychic and Ghost types in lower-tier competitive brackets (e.g., Smogon PU/ZU). However, it occupies the item slot, preventing the use of damage boosters like Life Orb or defensive items like Leftovers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Memory" suite. It interacts specifically with the **RKS System** ability. It does not facilitate evolution, but is essentially the "operating system" for Silvally's combat flexibility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired in a complete set of 17 Memories. In its debut (Sun/Moon), it is gifted to the player by Gladion at the Aether House after the main story. In later generations (Sword/Shield), it is provided by an NPC in the Battle Tower upon receiving Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a man-made technological artifact created by the Aether Foundation to replicate the "Multitype" ability of Arceus, it is restricted to laboratory-related distributions and special NPCs.
