## Identity & Utility
**Ruby** is a **plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** Described as an exquisitely beautiful gem with a red glow symbolizing passion. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon. It serves as a critical quest object in the post-game of *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; cannot be sold).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Ruby is one of two essential gems (alongside the Sapphire) required to power up the **Network Machine** operated by Celio on One Island. Delivering this item is a prerequisite for establishing a connection between the Kanto and Hoenn regions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and unlocking out-of-battle features. It has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, its delivery is the first step in unlocking the **Rainbow Pass**, which grants access to the remaining Sevii Islands (Four through Seven), and eventually enables cross-generational trading with the Hoenn-based games (*Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained at **Mt. Ember** on One Island. The player must defeat two Team Rocket Grunts to access the deeper chambers of the mountain where the Ruby is located.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique, one-time quest item found in the overworld.
* **Lore Context:** The Ruby represents the *Pokémon Ruby* version. Its recovery, alongside its counterpart the Sapphire, represents the technological bridge between the Kanto and Hoenn regions, facilitating the "Network" that allows Pokémon to be transferred across long distances.
