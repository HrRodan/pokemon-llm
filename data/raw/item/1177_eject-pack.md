## Identity & Utility
**Eject Pack** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that triggers a manual switch-out. When the holder’s stats are lowered by any means—including self-inflicted stat drops or opponent abilities—the item is consumed, and the Pokémon is immediately withdrawn from battle. It is a **Consumable Competitive Item** that can be bought at specialty shops.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Standard price; often requires Battle Points or specific progression to unlock).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If any of the holder's stats are lowered (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, or Evasion), the holder is immediately switched out for a chosen Pokémon in the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Moderate physical damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Strategic Staple.** It is most effectively used as a "pivot" tool. Competitive players pair it with powerful moves that have self-lowering stat penalties, such as **Draco Meteor**, **Leaf Storm**, **Overheat**, **Superpower**, or **Close Combat**. This allows the Pokémon to deal massive damage and immediately switch to a teammate to maintain momentum. 
    * **Note on Counter-Play:** It is also triggered by an opponent's **Intimidate** ability upon switching in, which can either disrupt the user's strategy or be used intentionally to pivot out of a bad lead matchup.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon use. It can be recovered during a battle via the move **Recycle** or the ability **Harvest**. It interacts with the ability **Unburden**, doubling the user's speed after the Pack is triggered and consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available through high-level battle facilities or specialized vendors. In Galar, it is purchased from the **Battle Tower** for 25 BP. In Paldea, it is sold at **Delibird Presents** branches (specifically in Mesagoza) after the player has made significant progress in the Gym Challenge.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is an engineered tactical tool for competitive trainers rather than a natural resource. It is usually gathered via **BP Shops** or found as rare loot in endgame areas.
