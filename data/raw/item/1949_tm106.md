## Identity & Utility
**TM106 (Smart Strike)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation VII** (re-indexed for **Generation IX** in the *Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk* expansion).
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide a Pokémon with the move **Smart Strike**. It is a **Consumable** (in Gen IX) that is primarily acquired through exploration in the Terarium or via crafting.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through **League Points (LP)** and material exchange).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Smart Strike**. This is a **Steel-type, Physical** move with a base power of **70**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Perfect Accuracy:** The move's primary utility is its inability to miss. It bypasses all accuracy checks and evasion modifiers, making it a reliable counter to "Minimize" or "Double Team" strategies.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in the current generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Coverage.** While Iron Head is generally preferred for its flinch chance, Smart Strike is utilized by Physical attackers that require Steel-type coverage but lack access to more powerful options. It is particularly valued in formats where evasion-boosting abilities or moves are prevalent.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon that possess horns, stingers, or sharp protrusions (e.g., Orthworm, Tinkaton, and various Horned/Pointed species).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Blueberry Academy Terarium** (The Indigo Disk). It can be found as a collectible item on the ground in the Canyon or Polar biomes.
* **Crafting Recipe:** Once obtained, it can be replicated at any TM Machine using:
    * **2,000 LP**
    * **3x Orthworm Tarnish**
    * **3x Tinkatink Hair**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Players must farm materials from wild **Orthworm** and the **Tinkatink** line to mass-produce this machine.
