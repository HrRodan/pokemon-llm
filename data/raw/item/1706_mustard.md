## Identity & Utility
**Mustard** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A condiment used specifically during the Picnic mechanic for crafting sandwiches. It serves as a seasoning that influences the Meal Powers of the resulting dish. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that can be purchased in bulk.
* **Cost:** 130 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich during a Picnic, Mustard contributes points toward specific **Meal Powers**. In the Paldean culinary system, Mustard is primarily associated with:
    * **Egg Power** (Speeds up Egg discovery)
    * **Exp. Point Power** (Increases EXP gained)
    * **Raid Power** (Increases rewards from Tera Raid Battles)
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Overworld Utility Only).** Its value is strictly limited to the sandwich-making mini-game to optimize Breeding, Grinding, or Raiding. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the **Picnic Mechanic**, where it acts as one of the seasoning components alongside items like Mayonnaise or Ketchup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at culinary retail outlets across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Sure Cans** locations once the player has started their Treasure Hunt.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced culinary product rather than a natural resource, and it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
