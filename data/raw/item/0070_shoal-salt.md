## Identity & Utility
**Shoal Salt** is a **Collectible / Crafting Ingredient** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A sample of pure salt harvested from the depths of Shoal Cave. It is a consumable crafting material that is highly sought after by specialty collectors. While it has no direct utility in battle, it is a critical component for regional item crafting.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap** base cost, though its "Maniac" value is significantly higher when sold to specific NPCs in later generations).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its debut generation, Shoal Salt is used as a crafting reagent. By delivering **four Shoal Salts** and **four Shoal Shells** to the old man in Shoal Cave, the player receives a **Shell Bell** (a competitive recovery item).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for the overworld and holds no value in a competitive move set. Its only competitive relevance is its role as a precursor to the Shell Bell.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is tide-dependent. It can only be collected during **Low Tide** (typically 9 AM–3 PM and 9 PM–3 AM) within Shoal Cave.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found naturally on the ground within **Shoal Cave** in the Hoenn region. It regenerates daily based on the tide cycle, making it a renewable resource for farming Shell Bells.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon.
* **Economic Value:** Despite its low listed cost of 20, flavor text across multiple generations (notably Black, White, and their sequels) indicates that "Item Maniacs" will purchase this item at a premium price, categorizing it alongside other "treasure" items like Big Pearls or Nuggets.
