In the modern "TM Machine" ecosystem, it is a consumable item that can be replicated if the player has the necessary materials. It is a **teaching utility** that cannot be purchased with standard Poké Dollars.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in Generation IX, or provide no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** Flamethrower is the gold standard for Special Fire-type coverage.
