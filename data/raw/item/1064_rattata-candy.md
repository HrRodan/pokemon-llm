## Identity & Utility
**Rattata Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies that boost a single stat, this item is tailored for a specific evolutionary line to increase all attributes simultaneously. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is technically purchasable but primarily earned through gameplay loops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a Pokémon in the **Rattata or Raticate** family (including Alolan forms), it increases all of their stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point in the form of **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is **Essential for Let's Go Meta** play. Because the *Let's Go* series uses AVs instead of traditional EVs, Species Candies are the most efficient way to maximize a Pokémon's potential. However, it has **No Utility** in standard VGC or Smogon formats for Generations VIII and IX, as the AV system was retired.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the stat-specific caps of regular candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy), allowing a Pokémon to reach the maximum 200 AVs in every stat more quickly.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not typically found in standard Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired by **transferring Rattata or Raticate to Professor Oak**, achieving high **Catch Combos** of wild Rattata, or via the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is a reward for the "Catch 'em all" gameplay loop rather than a farmable resource from wild encounters. In the context of the Alola-based *Let's Go* mechanics, it represents the concentrated essence of the species' vitality.
