## Identity & Utility
**Precooked Burger** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A culinary component specifically used for cooking at Pokémon Camps. It serves as a reliable, versatile base for various curry recipes. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought at specific vendors within the Galar region.
* **Cost:** 150 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during the Pokémon Camp cooking minigame, it produces the **Burger Curry** family of dishes. Depending on the berries added, it can result in Spicy, Dry, Sweet, Bitter, or Sour Burger Curry. Consuming the resulting curry restores Pokémon HP and PP, grants Experience Points, and increases Friendship levels.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low utility; provides no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held in battle and exists solely for the overworld Curry Dex and party maintenance mechanics in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several specialized ingredients (like Sausages or Instant Noodles) used to complete the Curry Dex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased from **Ingredients Sellers** found in the Galar Wild Area (specifically at locations like the Rolling Fields or Hammerlocke Hills). The inventory of these sellers rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is generally sourced through commerce or as a potential reward from certain NPC interactions in the Wild Area. In the context of Galar's culture, it represents the region's focus on "camping" and "outdoor bonding" between Trainers and their teams.
