## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (GRU8636)** is a **Special Event Item** (categorized under Dynamax Crystals) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It functions as a targeted "Raid Pass" for a specific encounter.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a nominal value in the data, it is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty den at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, this crystal can be consumed to summon a specific Dynamax Pokémon. This particular variant (**GRU8636**) was primarily distributed as a pre-order bonus or promotional event to trigger a Max Raid Battle against a **Gigantamax-capable Pokémon** (specifically **Duraludon** in the Japanese CoroCoro or retail distributions).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld consumable).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for acquisition/story-mode purposes, allowing players to capture a specific Pokémon with high individual values (IVs) or a Hidden Ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the beam of light appears, and the player has until midnight of the same day to complete the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** as part of promotional tie-ins (such as the *Sword & Shield* expansion pass purchases or retail partner promotions). It is not found through natural gameplay or exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item and cannot be farmed using the **Pickup** ability or **Thief** mechanic.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals served as a bridge between physical retail promotions and in-game rewards, ensuring players could encounter Rare Gigantamax forms earlier than they might appear in the natural Raid rotation.
