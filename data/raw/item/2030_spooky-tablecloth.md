* **Description:** A decorative item used to customize the aesthetic of the player's picnic setup. It features a "spooky" design theme, typically associated with Ghost-type motifs or dark, atmospheric patterns. It is a **Cosmetic Overworld** item that can be purchased and swapped at will during picnics.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, they can select this item to change the visual appearance of the picnic table. This change is purely aesthetic and does not alter the effects of Sandwiches or the rate of Egg discovery.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling data).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists exclusively for the Paldean overworld Picnic mechanic and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the broader Picnic system which is used for breeding Pokémon (obtaining Eggs) and gaining Meal Powers via sandwich making.
