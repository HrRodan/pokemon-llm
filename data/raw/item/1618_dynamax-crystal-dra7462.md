## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA7462)** is a **Special Event Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair—an inactive den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area—it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon that lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While it has a technical price in the code, it is primarily distributed via serial codes from retail promotions (e.g., Best Buy, GameStop, or pre-order bonuses) and is not found in Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair**, the crystal creates a pillar of red light, initiating a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. This specific variant (**DRA7462**) is coded to trigger an encounter with **Duraludon**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no utility in a competitive match, it is highly valued by players for obtaining Pokémon with guaranteed high individual values (IVs), specific Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax potential for use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area. Once the raid is successfully cleared or the day ends, the item is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **Event-Exclusive**. It was historically distributed via serial codes during special promotional periods for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It cannot be obtained through normal exploration or NPC shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It represents a "man-made" or "localized" concentration of Galar Particle energy harnessed for controlled Dynamax encounters.
