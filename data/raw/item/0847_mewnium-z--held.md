## Identity & Utility
**Mewnium Z** is a **Signature Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, crystallized form of Z-Power designed specifically for the Mythical Pokémon Mew. It is a **Held Item** that cannot be sold, traded, or consumed. It belongs to the elite category of Z-Crystals that are species-specific rather than type-specific.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via special events or specific NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Mew** that knows the move **Psychic**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Genesis Supernova**.
* **Genesis Supernova Details:** 
    * This move deals massive Psychic-type damage (Base Power: 185).
    * **Secondary Terrain Effect:** Upon execution, Genesis Supernova automatically summons **Psychic Terrain** for five turns, which powers up Psychic moves and protects grounded Pokémon from priority moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are immune to the move *Fling* and cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Covet*.
    * **Competitive Use:** A powerful niche tool in Generation VII formats. While Mew often prefers defensive items like Leftovers, the Mewnium Z provides an immediate offensive nuke and manual terrain control, which is particularly useful for disrupting opponents or setting up a sweep for Psychic-type teammates.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally useless if held by any Pokémon other than Mew. It is ignored by abilities like *Pickup* and cannot be utilized by Pokémon with the *Klutz* ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sun/Moon:** Originally distributed as a promotional gift for users of *Pokémon Bank*.
    * **Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon:** Obtained in-game at the **Tide Song Hotel** in Heahea City; an NPC provides it after the player shows him a Mew in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique "Key Held Item" that remains in the player's Bag/Inventory across the Alola journey once acquired.
* **Lore:** The crystal represents the unique resonance between Alolan Z-Power and the primordial DNA of Mew, allowing it to manifest a terrain-altering supernova.
