## Identity & Utility
**Gothita Eyelash** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Gothita evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon from the bag. Instead, it serves as a specialized currency for the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use in crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). It represents the "essence" of the Gothita line’s Psychic-type capabilities.
* **Crafting Applications:** In Pokémon Scarlet & Violet, this material is specifically required to craft:
    * **TM016 (Psybeam)**
    * **TM054 (Psyshock)**
    * **TM092 (Imprison)**
    * **TM120 (Psychic)**
    * **TM161 (Trick Room)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. Its value is entirely localized to the preparation and team-building phase (specifically for teaching moves).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Gothita family. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. Instead, it is automatically added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the defeat of:
    * **Gothita**
    * **Gothorita**
    * **Gothitelle**
* **Lore Context:** These eyelashes are said to be the source of the Gothita line's ability to perceive things others cannot, such as the stars or the "lifespan" of others, making them potent components for Psychic-type move creation.
