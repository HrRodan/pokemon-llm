## Identity & Utility
**Sentret Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material obtained from the Sentret evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. While it has a nominal sell value, it cannot be traditionally bought from Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Nominal Sell Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine. It is combined with League Points (LP) to create single-use TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the overworld economy and crafting systems; it provides no tactical advantage in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **TM Machine** mechanic introduced in the Paldea region and its surrounding territories (Kitakami).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Sentret** or **Furret**. It is also a common reward from Tera Raid Battles featuring these Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but rather a guaranteed or high-probability drop upon the conclusion of an encounter with the **Sentret** line.
* **Context:** Introduced during the Generation IX expansion (*The Teal Mask*), reflecting the ecosystem of the Kitakami region. Materials like Sentret Fur represent the "monster hunter" style gathering loop integrated into modern Pokémon titles to facilitate move-set customization.
