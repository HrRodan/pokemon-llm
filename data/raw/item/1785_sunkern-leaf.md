## Identity & Utility
**Sunkern Leaf** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material representing a biological sample from the Sunkern evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly from the bag to affect Pokémon stats. It is categorized under TM Materials, a system designed for the Technical Machine Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Value primarily used for conversion into League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as a component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, trainers combine these leaves with League Points (LP) to manufacture specific move-teaching discs. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TM Materials generally cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and therefore have no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Direct).** Its value is purely foundational for teambuilding, as it is required to craft competitive Grass-type moves (such as *Solar Beam* or *Grass Knot*) that may be essential for a Pokémon's moveset.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a drop-item resulting from combat rather than an evolution stone or held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a reward for defeating or catching members of the Sunkern line. It is not sold in standard Poké Marts but can be exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Sunkern** and **Sunflora** found in grassy biomes, particularly in the Artazon region (South Province Area Three) of Paldea.
* **Lore Context:** The Sunkern Leaf represents the proliferation of the TM Machine mechanic, where biological samples from Pokémon are synthesized with technology to replicate powerful moves for other team members.
