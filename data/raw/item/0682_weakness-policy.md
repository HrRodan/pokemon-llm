## Identity & Utility
**Weakness Policy** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized battle item that rewards a Pokémon for enduring a super-effective hit. It is a single-use consumable in competitive play (consumed upon activation) and cannot be used from the bag during battle.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range; however, it is traditionally acquired via Battle Points [BP] in most regions rather than standard currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a move to which it is weak (Super Effective damage), its **Attack and Special Attack are both increased by two stages (+2)**. This "sharp increase" effectively doubles the holder's offensive presence instantly.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Relatively high base power if thrown using the move Fling, though the item's primary effect is significantly more valuable).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **high-tier competitive staple**. In VGC (Doubles), it is frequently paired with "Self-Proc" strategies, where a fast teammate uses a weak super-effective move (e.g., *Quick Attack* from a Pixilate user or *Surf* on a Water-absorbent/resistant partner) to manually trigger the boost. In Singles, it is common on bulky sweepers like **Dragonite**, **Tyranitar**, or **Aegislash** who can reliably survive one super-effective hit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is consumed upon activation; if the Pokémon is switched out before activation, the item remains held. It has high synergy with the **Dynamax** mechanic (Gen VIII), as the increased HP pool makes surviving the necessary super-effective hit much easier.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Rarely found in general marts. It is typically a reward for high-level trainers, found in post-game locations such as the **Battle Maison**, **Battle Tree**, or **Battle Tower**. In the Galar region, it was available via the BP Shop.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It must be earned through battle facility participation or found as a rare overworld treasure in late-game areas.
