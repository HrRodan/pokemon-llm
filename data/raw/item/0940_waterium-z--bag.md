## Identity & Utility
**Waterium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade Water-type moves. In the bag, it represents the player's access to the Water-type Z-Move mechanic. It is a **Key Item / Held Item** hybrid that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; obtained via story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a Water-type move, it allows the use of the Water-type Z-Move: **Hydro Vortex**. 
    * If the base move is a **damaging move**, Hydro Vortex deals massive damage based on the original move's power.
    * If the base move is a **status move**, it creates a "Z-Status" move, adding secondary effects (e.g., **Z-Rain Dance** increases the user's Speed by one stage in addition to setting rain).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are unique in that they **cannot** be used with Fling, and they are immune to moves like **Knock Off**, **Thief**, or **Covet**. They also cannot be removed by the ability **Sticky Hold**.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VII).** Hydro Vortex was a defining force in the Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon competitive eras (VGC and Smogon). It allowed Water-type threats like Ash-Greninja, Gyarados, or Primarina to break through defensive walls by dealing a one-time burst of overwhelming damage that partially penetrates **Protect**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon, but it is required for any Pokémon (including Silvally with a Water Memory) to access Water-type Z-Moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is acquired during the **Island Challenge**. It is gifted to the player by **Trial Captain Lana** after completing the trial at **Brooklet Hill** on Akala Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique item tied to the player's Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore:** The Waterium Z represents the bond between a trainer and their Pokémon, manifesting the elemental power of Water into a physical crystalline form through the Alolan rite of the Z-Dance.
