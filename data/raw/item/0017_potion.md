## Identity & Utility
**Potion** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in Generation I (referenced here via Generation III metadata).
* **Description:** A spray-type medicine designed for treating minor wounds. It is a foundational healing item that is used both in the overworld to maintain team health and during battle for quick recovery. It is a consumable item that is highly accessible and can be bought at almost any Pokémon Mart.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores exactly **20 HP** to a single Pokémon. It is the first tier in the restorative hierarchy (Potion < Super Potion < Hyper Potion < Max Potion).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor physical damage; the healing effect is not applied when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** Not used in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as held items like Leftovers or Sitrus Berries provide passive recovery without wasting a turn. 
    * **Playthrough Utility:** Essential for early-game survival and a staple in **Nuzlocke challenges** to prevent losing team members during the first few Gym battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is "holdable," meaning a Pokémon can carry it, but it provides no passive benefit in battle; it must be used manually by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at all Pokémon Marts and Poké Centers starting from the very beginning of the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Zigzagoon** and **Linoone**. This makes it a common yield for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability, allowing players to farm them for free in the early stages of a journey.
