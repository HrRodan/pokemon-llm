## Identity & Utility
**TR23 (Spikes)** is a **Technical Record** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach the move **Spikes** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are **consumable**, breaking after a single use. It is a specialized move-learning tool primarily used for tactical team building.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate price; typically purchased using Watts from Watt Traders in the Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Spikes**. When used in battle, Spikes sets an entry hazard on the opponent's side of the field. Grounded Pokémon (those not Flying-type or possessing the Levitate ability) take damage upon switching in. The damage scales with "layers" (up to 3):
    * **1 Layer:** 1/8 (12.5%) of Max HP.
    * **2 Layers:** 1/6 (~16.6%) of Max HP.
    * **3 Layers:** 1/4 (25%) of Max HP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility.** Spikes is a staple in competitive Singles (Smogon) for "hazard stacking" strategies. It punishes frequent switching and is essential for breaking down defensive cores. Its value is slightly lower in VGC (Doubles) due to the faster pace of matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "spiky" or "tactical" Pokémon, such as Ferrothorn, Skarmory, and Cloyster.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR23 is primarily acquired by defeating Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** (typically Ground, Steel, or Poison types). It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 2,000–3,000 Watts (depending on the day's rotation) or generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively obtained through raids, shops, or rewards.
* **Lore Context:** TRs represent "Technical Records," a more volatile and powerful form of move teaching compared to the more stable, reusable TMs found in the Galar region. TR23 represents the tactical discipline of setting traps to control the battlefield.
