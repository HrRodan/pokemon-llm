## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LEO3852** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, single-use event item intended for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game marts. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Restricted Acquisition**; the nominal cost exists in the data, but the item is strictly obtained via external promotional distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area of the Wild Area), this crystal triggers a specific **Max Raid Battle** that remains active until midnight on the day it is used. Specifically, the "LEO3852" designation corresponds to a raid encounter with **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item functions as a session-starter for Max Raid Battles. However, the resulting Pokémon caught from the raid (Gigantamax Corviknight) is highly relevant in VGC and Smogon formats due to its "Mirror Armor" ability and "G-Max Wind Rage" move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a beacon for the Dynamax mechanic unique to the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Code** as a pre-order bonus or through retail partnerships (such as the Corocoro Ichiban! magazine or local hobby shops). It is not available through regular gameplay or the Armorite Ore/Watts traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a "Mystery Gift" tier item tied to real-world promotional events.
