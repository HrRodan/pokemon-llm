## Identity & Utility
**Swift Mochi** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically in the *The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** A round, sweet rice cake that serves as a specialized nutritional supplement for Pokémon. It is a consumable item that can be used to precisely fine-tune a Pokémon's stats. Unlike traditional vitamins like Carbos, Swift Mochi is primarily acquired through gameplay rewards in the Kitakami region.
* **Cost:** 125 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though its value is higher than the price suggests due to its limited purchase availability compared to standard Vitamins).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon, it increases its **Speed Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. If the Pokémon's Speed EVs are already at the maximum (252) or the total EV cap (510) has been reached, the item will have no effect.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item is consumed from the bag and is not intended for battle-hold mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** It is a staple for competitive players and VGC participants for efficient EV training. It functions identically to **Carbos** but is often preferred by players who engage in the *Ogre Oustin'* minigame as a "free" alternative to the expensive 10,000 Poké Dollar vitamins.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancing medicine. It is a more modern alternative to the Wings (e.g., Swift Wing), providing 10 points instead of 1, making it much faster for reaching specific stat benchmarks.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for completing levels of the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame at Kitakami Hall. It can also be found as a collectible item on the ground in the Kitakami region or occasionally sold by specific vendors in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its acquisition is tied to human-made snacks and cultural festivals within the Pokémon world (specifically the Festival of Masks).
