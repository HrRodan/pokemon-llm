## Identity & Utility
**Rellor Mud** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological byproduct or gathered substance dropped by members of the Rellor evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific move-teaching discs. It cannot be used directly in battle or held for a strategic effect.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use as an ingredient.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting TMs in the Paldea region. Specifically, it is utilized in the creation of powerful Bug-type and Psychic-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; it is purely a progression and customization item used to expand a Pokémon's move pool via crafting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution itself, it is dropped by **Rellor** and **Rabsca**. It is a mandatory resource for trainers looking to teach high-tier moves to their competitive roster without relying on finding TMs in the overworld.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Rellor** or **Rabsca**. These Pokémon are commonly found in the Asado Desert of the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop added to the player's inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Rellor line. It is frequently gathered in bulk by players using the **"Let's Go!" Auto-Battle feature**.
