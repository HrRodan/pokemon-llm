## Identity & Utility
**Z-ring** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola Region)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious ring that enables Pokémon to channel "Z-Power." It is a specialized Key Item that requires both the willpower and physical stamina of the Trainer to function. It is **cannot be bought, sold, or held** by a Pokémon; it resides in the Key Items pocket of the bag.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; unique story-related item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the essential conduit for **Z-Moves**. When the Trainer possesses the Z-Ring and a Pokémon holds a compatible **Z-Crystal**, the player can execute a high-powered Z-Move once per battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Defining.** In Generation VII competitive formats (VGC and Smogon), the Z-Ring was the core mechanical engine. It allowed for "Tactical Nukes"—one-time high-damage attacks that could bypass *Protect* (dealing 25% damage) and ignore negative stat modifiers if the base move was status-based (Z-Status moves).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is the precursor to the **Z-Power Ring** (introduced in *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*). It interacts specifically with the held items of the Pokémon (Z-Crystals) and is rendered useless if the Pokémon's held item is removed or if the Pokémon is under certain status conditions that prevent move execution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a core story element in *Pokémon Sun and Moon*. It is crafted by the Island Kahuna from a **Sparkling Stone**—a gift from the Alolan Island Guardians (the Tapu).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact given to the protagonist by **Hala** on Melemele Island after the player proves their worth to the island's guardian, Tapu Koko.
