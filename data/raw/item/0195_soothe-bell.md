## Identity & Utility
**Soothe Bell** is a **Training Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A musical held item that emits a comforting chime to calm the holder. It is a **Held Item** designed to accelerate the bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon. While it has a defined internal cost, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts, typically serving as a unique gift or exploration reward.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Semi-expensive; often restricted to specialized shops or NPC gifts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pokémon, any action that increases the holder's **Friendship (Happiness)** stat—such as walking, leveling up, or using certain vitamins—is **doubled** in effectiveness (+100% bonus). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-Competitive.** This item provides no tactical advantage in battle. Its utility is strictly for **metagame preparation**, specifically for streamlining the evolution of Pokémon that require high Friendship.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a cornerstone item for evolving species like **Eevee** (into Espeon, Umbreon, or Sylveon), **Riolu** (into Lucario), **Togepi** (into Togetic), and **Munchlax** (into Snorlax). It synergizes effectively with the **Luxury Ball**, further compounding Friendship gains.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained through specific NPCs who evaluate the player's bond with their Pokémon (e.g., the Pokémon Fan Club or the Friendship Checker). In some regions, it can be found as a hidden item in areas associated with tranquility, such as the Pokémon Mansion or National Park.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. Unlike items like the Everstone or Hard Stone, the Soothe Bell cannot be reliably farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild species; players must typically rely on fixed overworld locations.
