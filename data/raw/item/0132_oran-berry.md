## Identity & Utility
**Oran Berry** is a **Medicine** (Berry) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A versatile berry that provides minor health restoration. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be used both in and out of battle. It represents the standard, low-tier healing berry, serving as the direct successor to the "Berry" from Generation II.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **50% or below**, it consumes the berry to restore **10 HP**. It can also be used manually from the bag to restore 10 HP to a party Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (The target Pokémon consumes the berry and recovers 10 HP immediately).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it deals **Water-type** damage with 60 base power (Gen IV–VI).
    * **Competitive Use:** While generally outclassed by the Sitrus Berry in standard play (which restores 25% of max HP), the Oran Berry is a **staple in the Little Cup (LC) format**. Because LC Pokémon typically have low total HP (often between 19 and 25), a flat 10 HP restoration often recovers 40–50% of their total health, making it more effective than a Sitrus Berry.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Activates the **Cheek Pouch** ability (restoring additional HP).
    * Activates **Gluttony**, causing the Pokémon to eat the berry at 50% HP (though for Oran Berry, the activation threshold is already 50% by default).
    * Can be harvested repeatedly by Pokémon with the **Harvest** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in the overworld via Berry Trees and Soil Patches. Due to its low cost, it is often available in early-game Marts or through NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is one of the most common wild held items, found on 26 different species. It is frequently gathered from wild **Zigzagoon, Sentret, Pikachu, Bibarel, and Raticate**. Using a Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief/Covet** on early-route Pokémon is a reliable way to farm these berries.
