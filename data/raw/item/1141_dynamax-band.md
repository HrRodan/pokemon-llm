## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Band** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized wristband featuring an embedded Wishing Star. It serves as the conductor for Galar’s unique energy, allowing a Trainer to trigger the Dynamax or Gigantamax transformation when positioned at a "Power Spot" (such as Gym Stadiums or Max Raid Dens). It is a **Key Item** that is neither consumable nor holdable by Pokémon, and it cannot be discarded or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player the ability to **Dynamax** one Pokémon per battle for a duration of three turns. This transformation doubles the Pokémon's current and maximum HP (scaling with Dynamax Level) and converts all of its moves into powerful **Max Moves** (or G-Max Moves if the Pokémon has the Gigantamax Factor).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself is not "held," it was the **defining competitive mechanic** of Generation VIII VGC and Battle Stadium Singles. Unlike Mega Evolution or Z-Moves, the Dynamax Band allows *any* Pokémon on the team to transform without requiring a specific held item, preserving the item slot for Life Orbs, Choice items, or Focus Sashes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is mandatory for accessing **Gigantamax** forms for specific species (e.g., Charizard, Pikachu, Gengar). It does not trigger permanent evolution but provides a temporary form change. It functions only in specific locations designated as Power Spots.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a core story element in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. It is given to the player by **Professor Magnolia** early in the game after the player and their rival, Hop, retrieve Wishing Stars from a fallen meteor.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological marvel developed to harness the energy emanating from Eternatus (the source of the Dynamax phenomenon).
* **Lore Context:** The band acts as a stabilizer, focusing the "Galar Particles" required to manifest the massive size and reality-warping power associated with Dynamaxing. Without this band, a Trainer cannot safely command a Pokémon in its enlarged state.
