## Identity & Utility
**TM26 (Earthquake)** is a **Technical Machine (All-Machines)** introduced in **Generation I** (though metadata highlights its role starting in Generation III).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach the move **Earthquake** to a compatible Pokémon. In the Pokémon world, Earthquake is regarded as one of the most reliable and powerful Physical attacks. While the provided flavor text mentions poisoning, this is a known data discrepancy; the primary function defined in the effects is teaching the Ground-type move Earthquake.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the purchase price is low, its availability is usually restricted to late-game locations or high-tier rewards due to its immense power.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Earthquake** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Type: Ground / Category: Physical / Power: 100 / Accuracy: 100.
    * **Special Property:** Deals double damage to opponents currently using the move **Dig**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** Earthquake is a foundational move in both VGC and Smogon formats. It offers perfect accuracy and high base power, making it the gold standard for Physical attackers. In doubles, it hits all adjacent Pokémon (including allies), requiring strategic use of the "Levitate" ability or Flying-types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is a high-priority move for Pokémon with the **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) advantage, such as Garchomp, Mamoswine, and Great Tusk.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM26 has appeared in every major generation from Red/Blue to Scarlet/Violet. It is traditionally found in high-level areas such as **Victory Road**, **Wayward Cave**, or the **Great Marsh**. In later generations, it is often a reward for defeating high-level trainers or purchased at the Battle Frontier/BP Shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. Most Trainers obtain this through exploration or as a one-time reward from a Gym Leader (such as Giovanni in Gen I/III).
* **Historical Context:** Prior to Generation V, TM26 was a single-use item, making the decision of which Pokémon to teach Earthquake a critical strategic choice in a playthrough. From Gen V onwards, it became an infinite-use item (or a craftable "TR" or "TM" in the newest titles).
