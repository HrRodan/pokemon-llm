## Identity & Utility
**King's Rock** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** An ornate rock shaped like a crown. When held by a Pokémon, it grants their damaging moves a chance to cause the target to flinch, potentially skipping the opponent's turn. It is a **Competitive Held Item** and **Evolution Item** that can be purchased in specific late-game markets.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Damaging moves that do not already have a flinch chance gain a **10% chance** to cause the target to flinch. This effect is calculated independently of a move's existing secondary effects; for example, a move with a 30% flinch rate combined with this item results in a cumulative ~37% flinch chance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30. Using Fling with this item **guarantees a flinch** on the target (if they have not yet moved that turn).
    * **Multi-Hit Synergy:** The 10% flinch chance is rolled **independently for every hit** of a multi-hit move (e.g., Bullet Seed or Rock Blast), making it exceptionally potent on Pokémon with the **Skill Link** ability (like Cloyster or Cinccino).
    * **Competitive Use:** While niche due to its reliance on RNG, it is a "High-Variance Staple" for multi-hit attackers. In Smogon and VGC, it is often banned or restricted in certain formats ("Flinch Clause") because it can disrupt strategy through luck.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It serves as a specific evolution trigger. When held during a trade:
    * **Poliwhirl** evolves into **Politoed**.
    * **Slowpoke** (or Slowbro per internal data) evolves into **Slowking**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized shops like the Kanto/Johto Dept. Stores or earned through Battle Frontier/Subway BP exchanges.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is famously difficult to find but can be farmed from wild **Poliwhirl, Poliwrath, Slowpoke, Slowbro, Politoed, Slowking, Hariyama,** and **Hawlucha**. 
* **Farming Tip:** This item is a common reward for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at higher level tiers (typically Level 11–30+ depending on the specific game version).
