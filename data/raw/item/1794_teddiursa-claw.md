## Identity & Utility
**Teddiursa Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Teddiursa evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for League Points (LP) or used at the Technical Machine Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low sell price in shops, its primary economic value lies in its conversion into League Points (LP) at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at any Pokémon Center. It acts as a recipe requirement alongside LP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; its value is strictly limited to the "Prepare for Battle" phase where TMs are manufactured.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is **not** used for evolving Teddiursa into Ursaring. However, it is fundamentally tied to the Teddiursa species and is a byproduct of interacting with them in the wild.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the Paldea region (and potentially Kitakami). It is rewarded to the player after defeating or catching wild Pokémon from the Teddiursa family.
* **Wild Held Item/Drops:** Dropped by wild **Teddiursa**, **Ursaring**, and **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon)**. It is frequently gathered by players looking to craft TMs such as **TM064 (Bulk Up)** or **TM103 (Substitute)**, making it a common target for "farming" via Mass Outbreaks.
