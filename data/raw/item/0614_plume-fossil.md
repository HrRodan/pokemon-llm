## Identity & Utility
**Plume Fossil** is an **Evolution/Dex-Completion Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova Region)**.
* **Description:** A fossilized piece of a prehistoric Pokémon that inhabited the skies, resembling a fragment of a wing. It is a **Consumable (Single-use)** item that, while typically found through exploration rather than purchased, carries a high resale or valuation price.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/High-Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to a specific revitalization facility (such as the Nacrene City Museum in Unova or the Fossil Lab in Kalos), it can be regenerated into the Rock/Flying-type Pokémon **Archen**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High damage output, though consuming the fossil in this way is generally considered a waste of a rare resource).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A as a held item. However, it is the sole gateway to obtaining **Archeops**, a premier "Glass Cannon" known for its massive Base Attack (140) and Speed (110) stats, balanced by its detrimental ability, **Defeatist**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Archen, once revived from the Plume Fossil, evolves into Archeops starting at level 37.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Black/White), it is obtained as a choice from a Backpacker in the **Relic Castle**. In subsequent generations, it is often found via the **Konikoni City** shop (Sun/Moon), through the **Digging Duo** in the Galar Wild Area, or by smashing rocks in specific caves.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through environmental interaction, mining minigames, or specific NPC gifts.
* **Counterpart:** It is the biological counterpart to the **Cover Fossil** (which revives Tirtouga); usually, players must choose between the two, making the Plume Fossil a version-exclusive or choice-restricted item in several regional playthroughs.
