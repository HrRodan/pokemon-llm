## Identity & Utility
**Persim-berry** is a Medicine (Berry) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A restorative fruit to be consumed by Pokémon. It is a consumable held item that can be used both in-battle and overworld to recover from confusion. If held, the Pokémon will automatically consume it the moment it becomes confused.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Highly Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly cures the **Confusion** status condition. When used from the bag, it heals a party member; when held in battle, it triggers automatically upon confusion.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Cures the target's confusion upon impact).
    * **Natural Gift:** In competitive play (Gen IV+), it acts as a **Steel-type** move with 60 to 80 Base Power.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. It is primarily used on physical attackers that utilize self-confusing moves like **Outrage**, **Thrash**, or **Petal Dance** to maintain offensive momentum. While generally outclassed by the **Lum Berry** (which cures all status), it is preferred in specific formats with an "Item Clause" where the Lum Berry is already assigned to another teammate. It is also a staple in Nuzlocke challenges to counter early-game "Supersonic" or "Confuse Ray" users.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Cheek Pouch** (restores HP when eaten), **Harvest** (may regenerate the berry), and **Ripen** (doubles the effect, though confusion cure is binary).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available via Berry trees and patches across most regions. It is frequently sold in specialized Berry shops or given away by NPCs (Berry Master).
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is commonly found in the wild. It is held by a diverse range of Pokémon including **Girafarig**, **Seviper**, **Spoink**, **Gothita**, and **Drampa**. It can be efficiently farmed using the **Thief** move or collected via the **Pickup** ability at various level scaling tiers.
