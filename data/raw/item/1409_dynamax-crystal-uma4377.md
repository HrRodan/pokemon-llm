## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA4377** is a specialized **Consumable Event Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, crystal-like object that reacts with the Power Spots of the Galar region. It is used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area to trigger a Max Raid Battle. It is a single-use consumable that remains active until the end of the day it is used.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; primarily obtained via promotional serial codes and not sold in standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins), it summons a specific Dynamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, **UMA4377** is the designated crystal for encountering **Eiscue**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. Its utility is strictly for overworld encounter generation. However, it is highly valued by players for obtaining Pokémon with guaranteed high IVs, Hidden Abilities, or version-exclusive species for competitive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Den** mechanic in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed through **special promotional events** (typically via serial codes from retailers like GameStop, Target, or EB Games). It is not available through natural progression or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals like UMA4377 were often used as version-exclusive bridges. For example, while Eiscue is normally exclusive to *Pokémon Shield*, this crystal allowed *Pokémon Sword* players to host a raid and capture the Pokémon in their own game. Items in this category represent the peak of Generation VIII's "live service" event distribution model.
