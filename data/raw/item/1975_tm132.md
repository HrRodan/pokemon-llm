## Identity & Utility
**TM132 (Baton Pass)** is a **Machine** (Technical Machine) introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This TM teaches the Status-class Normal-type move **Baton Pass**. In the Paldea region, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard shops; requires **3,000 LP** and specific materials to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Baton Pass**. When used in battle, the user switches out and passes along any stat changes (modifiers to Attack, Defense, Speed, etc.) and certain volatile status conditions (such as Substitute, Aqua Ring, or Confusion) to the Pokémon that replaces it.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility/Staple.** Baton Pass is a defining move in competitive play. It is used to maintain "momentum" by pivoting out of bad matchups while preserving stat boosts gained from moves like Swords Dance or Calm Mind. In many Smogon formats, the move is heavily restricted or banned due to the overwhelming power of "Baton Pass Chains." In VGC (Doubles), it is a niche but effective tool for repositioning.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This TM is essential for many "Pivot" and "Set-up Sweeper" archetypes. It allows glass cannons to inherit defensive boosts or speed from more durable teammates.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available in **Pokémon Scarlet & Violet** and its DLC, **The Teal Mask**. It can be found as a collectible item in the overworld or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine after defeating specific Team Star bases or finding it in the wild.
* **Crafting Materials:** In Generation IX, crafting TM132 requires:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Girafarig Fur**
    * **3x Eevee Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; however, the materials required to create it are harvested from wild **Eevee** and **Girafarig** (or their evolutions).
