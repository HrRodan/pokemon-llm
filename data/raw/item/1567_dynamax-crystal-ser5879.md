## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Ser5879)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based item used in Pokémon Sword and Shield. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this is a symbolic internal value for an event-exclusive item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Dynamax Pokémon to appear. The player can then participate in a Max Raid Battle against that Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** While the crystal itself has no battle effect, it is used by competitive players to guarantee an encounter with a specific Pokémon—often one with high IVs, a Hidden Ability, or an exclusive Gigantamax form—which can then be trained for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly. It serves as a trigger for the Max Raid Battle mechanic unique to the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily through **Serial Codes** or special retail promotions (such as those from GameStop or Pokémon Center events). Once the code is redeemed, the crystal appears in the player's "Other Items" pocket.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly external distribution item meant to facilitate limited-time encounters.
