## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (HER6410)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once consumed, the targeted Pokémon remains available at the lair until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that is not obtainable through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal price, it cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts and is primarily distributed via serial codes or promotional events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive den in the Wild Area), it activates a **Max Raid Battle** against a predetermined Pokémon. This allows players to encounter specific species or Gigantamax forms that might otherwise be rare or unavailable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely as an overworld encounter trigger. However, the Pokémon caught from the resulting Raid often possess high Individual Values (IVs) or Hidden Abilities, making the item a valuable tool for competitive breeding and team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It acts as a "key" to a specific encounter. It is consumed upon the activation of the raid den, regardless of whether the player wins or loses the battle (though players can usually retry the battle until the day ends).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** during promotional campaigns (such as those through retailers like GameStop, Micromania, or specialized Pokémon Center events). Each "HER" series crystal typically corresponds to a specific encounter (e.g., Gigantamax Sandaconda, Centiskorch, or Copperajah).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial/mysterious crystalline structure linked to the **Power Spot** energy of the Galar region. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or any other in-game farming method.
