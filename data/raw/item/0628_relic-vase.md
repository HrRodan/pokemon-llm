## Identity & Utility
**Relic Vase** is a **Loot/Treasure** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** An ancient artifact crafted by a civilization approximately 3,000 years ago. It functions as high-value "vendor trash" designed specifically for wealth accumulation. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot** be bought from any standard retail location.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is realized only upon selling it to specialized collectors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Relic Vase has no functional use in the overworld or in battle other than being sold. It can be sold to the **Villa Owner (the Item Maniac)** in Undella Town for **50,000 Poké Dollars**, making it one of the most valuable treasure items in the Unova region.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Minimal damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the in-game economy (story/playthrough) to fund expensive items like TMs, Vitamins, or luxury apparel.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is part of the "Relic" set (including Relic Copper, Silver, Gold, Band, Statue, and Crown) associated with the history of the Abyssal Ruins.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found as treasure within the **Abyssal Ruins** off the coast of Route 13 in the Unova region. Navigating the ruins efficiently is required to collect these before the player is expelled by the currents.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike items like Stardust or Nuggets, which can be farmed from wild Staryu or Grimer, the Relic Vase is a finite resource found in specific locations.
* **Lore Context:** The vase is a key piece of Unova’s deep history, linked to the ancient king and the civilization that submerged into the ocean. While standard Poké Marts will buy it for a nominal fee, the true value is only recognized by the billionaire collector in Undella Town who appreciates its historical significance.
