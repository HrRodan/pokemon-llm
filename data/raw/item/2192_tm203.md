## Identity & Utility
**TM203** is a Technical Machine (TM) introduced in **Generation IX** specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. While historically TMs were either infinite-use or single-use, in Generation IX, they are consumable items that can be manufactured repeatedly using materials and League Points. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars. It is **Not for sale** in traditional Poké Marts; it is acquired via exploration or the TM Machine crafting system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psychic Noise** (Special, Psychic-type, 75 BP, 100% Accuracy).
* **Move Mechanics:** Psychic Noise deals damage and prevents the target from recovering HP for two turns. This "Heal Block" effect applies to moves (like *Recover* or *Roost*), Abilities (like *Regenerator*), and held items (like *Leftovers*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be effectively used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-value **anti-stall utility** move. In both VGC (doubles) and Smogon (singles), it is used to shut down defensive walls like Blissey, Dondozo, or Garganacl. Because it is a sound-based move, it can bypass *Substitute*, though it is blocked by the *Soundproof* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide range of Psychic-type Pokémon and various "sound-themed" Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy. Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked at the **TM Machine**, allowing the player to craft duplicates using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials (typically dropped by Psychic-type Pokémon).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is strictly a man-made technological device.
* **Nuzlocke Context:** Highly valuable in "Hardcore Nuzlockes" for boss fights involving recovery-heavy opponents, providing a guaranteed way to prevent a fight from stalling out.
