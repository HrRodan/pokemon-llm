## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Phone** is a specialized **Key Item** (categorized as an Event Item in some internal datasets) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech smartphone that houses a Rotom, a Pokémon capable of inhabiting electronic devices. It serves as the player's primary multifunctional tool, merging the utility of a Pokédex, Town Map, and communication device. As a **Key Item**, it cannot be discarded, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story-essential item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Rotom Phone acts as the central hub for player navigation and data collection. 
    * **Galar (Gen VIII):** It is used to access the Pokédex and Town Map. It also integrates with the **Rotom Bike**, providing the "Turbo" speed boost functionality and eventually the ability to travel across water.
    * **Paldea (Gen IX):** It provides the Map App, Camera App, and Pokédex, and allows players to receive calls from NPCs to advance the plot.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld and UI management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, the Rotom within the phone is a distinct entity from the Rotom a player might use in battle. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is gifted to the player as a scripted story event early in their journey. 
    * In **Sword & Shield**, it is provided by **Sonia** in Postwick. 
    * In **Scarlet & Violet**, it is given to the player by their **Mother** at the start of the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of technology manufactured specifically for Trainers to facilitate their journey and data entry.
* **Lore Note:** The Rotom Phone represents the peak of modern Pokémon-human technological integration, replacing older standalone devices like the Pokégear, PokéNav, and Pokétch with a singular, sentient mobile device.
