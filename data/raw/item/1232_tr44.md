## Identity & Utility
**TR44** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** TR44 is a single-use consumable machine used to teach a Pokémon a specific move—in this case, **Cosmic Power**. Unlike the TMs of its debut generation, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, making them a resource that must be managed or farmed. 
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (interpretive: Though listed as 4,000 in data, it is primarily acquired via **Watts** in the Galar region, making it an **Accessible/Mid-tier** resource for trainers).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently teaches the move **Cosmic Power** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Effect:** Cosmic Power raises the user's **Defense** and **Special Defense** stats by one stage each. It is a non-damaging Psychic-type status move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; generally not a viable strategy for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Highly specialized. Cosmic Power is a staple for "Cosmic Power + Stored Power" sets, commonly seen on defensive threats like **Clefable**, **Sigilyph**, and **Metagross**. By boosting both defensive stats simultaneously, the user becomes significantly harder to KO while increasing the base power of Stored Power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Psychic, Rock, and "Space-themed" Pokémon (e.g., Deoxys, Solrock, Lunatone).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR44 can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts (typically 2,000–3,000 W). It is also frequently dropped as a reward for defeating **Psychic-type Pokémon** in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a manufactured record of move data. In the Galar region lore, TRs represent older, more fragile technology compared to the indestructible TMs, containing moves that are often more powerful or strategically complex.
