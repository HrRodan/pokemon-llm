## Identity & Utility
**Meteorite (Variant 2)** is a **Key Item** (categorized as "unused" in internal data) introduced in **Generation VII** (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A mysterious stone recovered from Mt. Chimney that emits a faint, otherworldly glow. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or consumed. While this specific data entry is found in the Alola-region games, the text refers to its origins in the Hoenn region.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the context of the Pokémon series, the Meteorite serves as a vital plot device. Its primary mechanical function is to facilitate the **Forme Change of Deoxys**. When a player has Deoxys in their party and interacts with certain meteorites (found in locations like Hokulani Observatory in Gen VII or Professor Cozmo's lab in Hoenn), Deoxys can cycle between its **Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Formes**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item used exclusively in the overworld. It has no direct impact on battle stats, though the Forme Changes it facilitates are crucial for competitive Deoxys builds.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is the exclusive trigger for **Deoxys's** transformation. It is historically associated with Professor Cozmo.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally obtained during the climax of the Mt. Chimney arc involving Team Magma or Team Aqua. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, while this specific item entry exists in the code to reference the Hoenn-based plot, the player utilizes stationary meteorites located at the **Hokulani Observatory** on Ula'ula Island to change Deoxys's Formes.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique story-related object typically granted by NPCs or found at specific landmarks.
