## Identity & Utility
**Berry Juice** is a **Consumable Medicine** and **Competitive Held Item** introduced in Generation II (standardized in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A 100% pure juice extract derived from Berries. It functions as a dual-purpose item that can be used manually from the bag or held by a Pokémon for automatic mid-battle recovery. It is a **low-tier healing item**, comparable to a standard Potion but with the added benefit of being "Holdable."
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used or consumed, it **restores 20 HP** to a single Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor damage; the target consumes the juice and restores 20 HP if applicable).
    * **Competitive Use:** While outclassed by items like Leftovers or Sitrus Berries in standard play, Berry Juice is a **top-tier competitive staple in the Little Cup (LC) format**. Because LC Pokémon are Level 5 and typically have low HP stats (often between 20 and 25), a 20 HP heal frequently restores nearly 100% of their total health, making it significantly more effective than an Oran Berry.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is intrinsically linked to the Pokémon **Shuckle**. In earlier generations, a Shuckle holding a standard Berry would eventually "ferment" it into Berry Juice. It interacts with abilities like **Recycle**, **Harvest**, and **Pickup**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in specialized shops, juice stands (like those in Lumiose City), or obtained through Shuckle.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously associated with **Shuckle**. In various titles, wild Shuckle have a high probability of holding Berry Juice, making them the primary farming source for this item.
* **Lore context:** The juice is created within the hollow shells of Shuckle, where Berries are stored and eventually liquify into this potent healing tonic.
