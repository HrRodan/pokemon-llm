## Identity & Utility
**Paras Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy tailored to the biological makeup of the Paras evolutionary line. When fed to a compatible Pokémon, it boosts all performance metrics simultaneously. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold or bought for a nominal fee.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Paras** or **Parasect**, it increases every single stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** in the form of **Awakened Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in standard battle formats where the move Fling exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is used to maximize a Pokémon's potential for "No Restrictions" battles within those titles but is entirely absent and non-functional in standard VGC, Smogon, or main-line Generation VIII+ competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Rare Candies, this does not increase Level. It is specifically used for stat-padding within the unique AV system of the Kanto remakes. It has no effect on Pokémon outside of the Paras/Parasect family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee* by:
    1.  **Catching Wild Paras:** Catching multiple Paras in a row (Catch Combos) increases the chance of receiving this candy.
    2.  **Transferring to Professor Oak:** Sending surplus Paras to the Professor rewards the player with these candies.
    3.  **Strolling:** Walking a Paras/Parasect in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon as a held item; instead, it is a reward for the act of capturing or releasing them. It is most efficiently gathered by farming Paras in locations like **Mt. Moon**.
