## Identity & Utility
**Kricketot Shell** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A dropped material consisting of a fragment from a Kricketot's hard, musical shell. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any benefit.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient in the crafting of Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. It is primarily required for Bug-type or sound-themed moves.
    * *Known Crafting Recipes:* Used to create **TM015 (Struggle Bug)** and **TM021 (Pounce)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the out-of-battle economy and move-pool customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the **TM Machine** mechanics in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching members of the Kricketot evolutionary line in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" that can be stolen with Thief or Covet, it is guaranteed/highly likely to be dropped by wild **Kricketot** and **Kricketune** upon their defeat in the Paldea region. It is often gathered in bulk through "Let's Go!" auto-battling.
