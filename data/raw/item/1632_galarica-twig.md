## Identity & Utility
**Galarica Twig** is a **Collectible / Material** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** A small branch from the Galarica tree, found exclusively in the Galar region. It serves as a specialized crafting material required to create evolution items for specific regional forms. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold, though it is far more valuable for its utility in evolution than its monetary return.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Galarica Twig has no direct effect in battle or when used from the bag. Instead, it acts as a **currency/material** for specific NPCs:
    * **8 Twigs:** Can be woven into a **Galarica Cuff** by an NPC on an island in the Workout Sea.
    * **15 Twigs:** Can be woven into a **Galarica Wreath** by an NPC in the Roaring-Sea Caves (Crown Tundra).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for the overworld and has no viable use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the fundamental prerequisite for evolving **Galarian Slowpoke**. 
    * The **Galarica Cuff** evolves Galarian Slowpoke into **Galarian Slowbro**.
    * The **Galarica Wreath** evolves Galarian Slowpoke into **Galarian Slowking**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily as recurring hidden items (sparkling spots) on the ground throughout the **Isle of Armor**, particularly under trees in the Workout Sea, Stepping-Stone Sea, and Insular Sea.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Gathering requires manual exploration or "farming" the respawning sparkles in the Isle of Armor environment.
* **Lore context:** The twigs are imbued with a unique spice and chemical property from the Galarica tree, which reacts with the toxins in a Galarian Slowpoke’s body to trigger its unique regional evolutions.
