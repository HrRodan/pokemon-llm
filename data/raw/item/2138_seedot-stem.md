## Identity & Utility
**Seedot Stem** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a shed part or essence of a Seedot. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that is used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. It cannot be used directly in battle or overworld for healing.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap). In-game, it is more commonly exchanged for **League Points (LP)** or used as a reagent in crafting recipes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Once used at a TM Machine, the material is consumed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a meta-progression item used for team building (teaching moves) rather than a competitive held item or battle-ready consumable.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency for the TM crafting system. It is part of the "Pokémon Materials" ecosystem introduced to facilitate move-set customization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for catching or defeating members of the Seedot evolutionary line (Seedot, Nuzleaf, and Shiftry) in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense, it is a **guaranteed drop** upon defeating a wild **Seedot**, **Nuzleaf**, or **Shiftry**. 
* **Context:** In the Paldea region (and its surrounding areas like Kitakami), these stems are essential for trainers looking to teach their Pokémon grass or dark-type utility moves that Seedot is known for, such as *Bullet Seed* or *Grassy Terrain*.
