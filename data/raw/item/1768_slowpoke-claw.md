## Identity & Utility
**Slowpoke Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a biological specimen (a claw) shed or collected from members of the Slowpoke evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon to gain a functional advantage. It is primarily managed within the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Negligible/Resource value; primarily exchanged for League Points (LP) at the TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Slowpoke Claw serves as a specific required ingredient at the **Technical Machine Machine (TMM)**. It is combined with League Points (LP) to create TMs that teach various moves.
* **Crafting Applications:** In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, this material is specifically required to craft the following TMs:
    * **TM070 (Sleep Talk):** Requires 3 Slowpoke Claws.
    * **TM085 (Rest):** Requires 3 Slowpoke Claws.
    * **TM161 (Trick Room):** Requires 5 Slowpoke Claws.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles. Its value lies entirely in the "Prep-Phase" of competitive play—expanding a Pokémon's move pool by crafting essential utility moves like *Trick Room*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Slowpoke family.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item, but rather a post-battle drop from:
    * **Slowpoke**
    * **Slowbro**
    * **Slowking**
* **Farming Context:** Best farmed in the **Casseroya Lake** region or the beaches of the **East Province**, where Slowpoke are abundant. In the lore of the Paldea region, these materials represent the integration of the ecosystem into the high-tech TM manufacturing process.
