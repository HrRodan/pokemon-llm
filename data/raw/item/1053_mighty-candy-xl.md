## Identity & Utility
**Mighty Candy XL** is a **Vitamin (Stat-Enhancer)** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy designed to boost a Pokémon's physical power. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used from the bag on a Pokémon in the party, provided that Pokémon has reached a high level of maturity (Lv. 60+).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the resale value is low, its utility value in the endgame is significant for maximizing potential.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently increases a Pokémon’s **Attack stat** by increasing its **Awakening Values (AVs)**. This specific "XL" variant is the highest tier of Mighty Candy and is restricted to Pokémon at **Level 60 or higher**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is **exclusive to the Let's Go series mechanics**. It is not used in standard VGC or Smogon formats that utilize traditional Effort Values (EVs). Within the *Let's Go* meta, it is essential for "Master Trainers" and endgame optimization, as it allows a Pokémon to reach its maximum physical damage ceiling.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Mighty" hierarchy: Mighty Candy (Small) < Mighty Candy L < **Mighty Candy XL**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through the **Catch Combo** mechanic and by transferring Pokémon to **Professor Oak**. Capturing large quantities of Pokémon that yield Attack stats (such as the Machop, Mankey, or Nidoran♂ lines) will frequently result in the player receiving these candies.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Instead, it is awarded directly to the Trainer as a reward for skillful hunting or for contributing to the Professor's research. It is a core component of the "AV" training system which replaced the traditional EV system in the Kanto-revisit games.
