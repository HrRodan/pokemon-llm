## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (BOO5235)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, it causes a unique Pokémon to appear at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, the encounter remains available until the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; typically not sold in standard Poké Marts and acquired through external distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific empty den in the Wild Area), it initiates a Max Raid Battle with a predetermined Pokémon (associated with the BOO5235 serial code). In historical distributions, this specific crystal was used to encounter **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a competitive battle context).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld designed for PvE (Player vs. Environment) content and collection purposes. It allows players to capture Pokémon with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors that might otherwise be difficult to find.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "summoning" item for the Max Raid mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found through natural gameplay. It was exclusively distributed via **serial codes** provided by retailers (such as GameStop or EB Games) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* expansion pass or specific promotional events. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-exclusive distribution item that resides in the "Other Items" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag until consumed.
* **Usage Context:** Because the Watchtower Lair is normally inactive, the Dynamax Crystal serves as a "key" to unlock a high-tier raid boss, guaranteeing a specific encounter that does not rely on the standard "Wishing Piece" RNG (Random Number Generation).
