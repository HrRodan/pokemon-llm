## Identity & Utility
**Foongus Spores** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological material shed by the Foongus evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a TM Machine. While it has a defined cost, it is primarily obtained through gameplay rather than purchased.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific crafting component required to create Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a TM Material, it has no utility in active battle. Its value lies entirely in the "Preparation Phase" of competitive play, allowing trainers to teach essential moves to their team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone. However, it is fundamentally linked to the **Foongus** and **Amoonguss** species. It is used in the recipes for various TMs—most notably Grass-type or powder-based moves (e.g., Giga Drain).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop by defeating or catching wild **Foongus** or **Amoonguss**. It is a common drop in the forests and grassy biomes of the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally held as an item; it is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is highly efficient to farm these using the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature.
