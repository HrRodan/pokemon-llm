## Identity & Utility
**Strange Souvenir** is a **Loot/Collectible** item introduced in **Generation VI**.
* **Description:** An ornament depicting a mysterious Pokémon venerated as a guardian deity. It is a **Consumable (Loot)** item that **cannot be bought** but can be sold to vendors. It functions primarily as a teaser for future game regions.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Classified mechanically as "Vendor Trash," it has no functional use in battle or the overworld. Its sole mechanical purpose is to be sold to Poké Marts for profit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a purely aesthetic/narrative item with no utility in Smogon or VGC formats. It does not provide any stat modifiers or passive recovery.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions and has no interactions with specific abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is obtained by speaking to a Backpacker in various hotels over a period of four days. He claims to be from a region far from Kalos, which was later revealed to be **Alola**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. 
* **Lore Context:** The Strange Souvenir is a significant "Easter Egg" in the Pokémon franchise. While introduced in the Kalos region (Gen VI), its flavor text and appearance directly reference the **Tapu guardian deities** of the Alola region (Gen VII). It served as the first official hint toward the Alola region's existence before *Pokémon Sun and Moon* were announced. Despite its high flavor significance, it remains a "Loot" category item with no practical gameplay application.
