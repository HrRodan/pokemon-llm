## Identity & Utility
**Iapapa-berry** is a Picky-Healing Berry introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A consumable berry that provides emergency healing when the holder's HP drops. It belongs to a specific cycle of "Pinch Berries" (alongside Figy, Wiki, Mago, and Aguav) that provide significant healing but carry a risk of confusion based on the Pokémon's Nature. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is generally available for purchase or farming.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP falls to **1/2 (50%)** or less, the berry is consumed to restore **1/8 (12.5%)** of the holder’s maximum HP. 
    * *Note on Taste:* Because this berry is **Sour**, it will cause **Confusion** if the Pokémon has a Nature that dislikes sour flavors (specifically Natures that decrease **Defense**: **Bold, Modest, Calm, and Timid**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the berry's healing effect and potential confusion on the target).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dark-type** move with 80 Power.
    * **Competitive Use:** While the JSON reflects its earlier-generation values (1/8 HP), in modern competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), these berries are famous for their Gen 7 buff (restoring 50% HP) and Gen 8 adjustment (restoring 33% HP). They are staples on defensive Pokémon or those with the **Gluttony** ability (like Snorlax or Alolan Muk), which allows them to consume the berry earlier at 50% HP for massive recovery.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with the **Harvest** ability (allowing for infinite berry recycling) and **Ripen** (doubling the healing amount).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly obtained through Berry Trees, Berry Piles (Generation VII/VIII), or by planting and harvesting in specialized soil. In Hoenn, it was primarily obtained by giving specific phrases to the Berry Master's wife or found on Route 123.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not listed as a common hold item for wild Pokémon in this dataset, these berries are frequently gathered via the **Pickup** ability at mid-to-high levels or found held by wild Pokémon in specific regional variants (e.g., Alolan forms).
