## Identity & Utility
**Timburr Sweat** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Timburr evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon from the bag. While it has a nominal sell price, its primary value lies in its use at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine).
* **Cost:** 30 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a currency/material at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle economy for move-teaching accessibility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a byproduct of defeating or catching specific species and serves as a requirement for generating high-value physical or Fighting-type TMs (such as **TM058 - Brick Break** or **TM184 - Vacuum Wave** in *Scarlet & Violet*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in regions where Timburr is present, most notably the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC). It is not available in standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is a **guaranteed drop** obtained after defeating or catching wild **Timburr**, **Gurdurr**, or **Conkeldurr**. It can also be found as a sparkling pickup on the ground in areas inhabited by these Pokémon.
* **Context:** The item represents the physical exertion and grit of the Timburr line, known for their prowess in construction and physical labor; this "essence" is distilled into data to create TMs.
