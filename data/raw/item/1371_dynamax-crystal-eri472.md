## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ERI472** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax encounter until the end of the day. It is a consumable event item that is generally not available through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominally **Cheap**, but effectively restricted/not for sale in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins) while possessing this crystal, it activates a **Max Raid Battle**. This allows the player and their allies to face a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal ID ERI472) which would otherwise not be present in that den.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate catching rare Pokémon or obtaining raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, etc.). It has no application in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a beacon for the Dynamax phenomenon. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific encounter tied to the crystal's ID.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are historically distributed via **Serial Codes** provided during special retail promotions (such as at GameStop, Target, or Pokémon Center stores) or as bonuses for purchasing specific software bundles (e.g., the Sword & Shield Dual Pack or Expansion Pass). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique digital key granted through external distributions.
* **Location Context:** Its utility is geographically locked to the **Watchtower Ruins** in the Wild Area of the Galar region. Once the raid is activated, the crystal is consumed.
