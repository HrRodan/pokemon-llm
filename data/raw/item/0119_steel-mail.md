## Identity & Utility
**Steel-Mail** is an **All-Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring cool mechanical designs. It is a **Consumable/Held** item used primarily for social communication between players. Once a message is written, the Pokémon holds the mail for delivery during a trade.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message using a predetermined list of words and phrases. This message is attached to a Pokémon and sent to another player via trading. The recipient can read the message, store it in their PC, or erase it to make the stationery reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** While primarily a social tool, Mail possesses a unique mechanical niche: **Item Protection.** A Pokémon holding Mail cannot be placed into the PC boxes. Furthermore, any move that attempts to remove, steal, or swap the item—such as **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Covet**, **Trick**, or **Switcheroo**—will automatically fail. 
    * **Strategic Context:** In older competitive formats (Generations IV and V), Mail was occasionally used as a niche "sticky" item to prevent a Pokémon from losing its item slot to Knock Off, though it offers no statistical benefits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is ignored by abilities like **Pickup**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Pokémon Marts** and specialized Stationery shops within the Sinnoh and Johto (HGSS) regions. Due to its mechanical nature, it was largely phased out of the series starting in Generation VI.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon; it is an artificial consumer good manufactured for Trainer communication.
* **Lore context:** The "Steel" variant of mail represents the industrial and mechanical aesthetic of the mid-2000s Pokémon era, often associated with locations like Canalave City or the Steel-type specialist Byron.
