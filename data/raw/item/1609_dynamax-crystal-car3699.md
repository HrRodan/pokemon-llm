## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (car3699)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **single-use consumable** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay channels.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal cost**; though technically assigned a value, it is primarily an event-distributed item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal forces a Max Raid Battle to spawn. Specifically, the "car3699" variant is tied to a promotional distribution for **Gigantamax Corviknight**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is used to encounter Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities** and **Gigantamax Factors**, which are essential for competitive VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific species encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed as a **promotional serial code** (notably through CoroCoro Comic in Japan). It is not available at Pokémon Marts or through the Watt Traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special" or "Event" item, often distributed to provide players early or guaranteed access to Gigantamax forms that otherwise rely on rare spawn rates in Max Raid Dens.
* **Lore context:** Dynamax Crystals are crystallized fragments of Galar's power spot energy, allowing a trainer to summon a Dynamax phenomenon at will at a designated ancient site.
