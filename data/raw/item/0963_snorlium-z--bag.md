## Identity & Utility
**Snorlium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This is a species-specific Z-Crystal designed specifically for Snorlax. When held by a Snorlax that knows the move **Giga Impact**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into a devastating, exclusive Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a permanent Key Item that acts as a non-consumable held item in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through special events or specific NPC interactions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If a Snorlax is holding this crystal and has the move **Giga Impact** in its moveset, it can utilize the Z-Move **Pulverizing Pancake**. This move deals massive physical Normal-type damage (Base Power: 210) and features a unique animation where Snorlax wakes up to flatten the opponent.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, nor can they be removed or stolen by moves like Thief or Knock Off).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. While Pulverizing Pancake is one of the strongest single-hit moves in the game, it requires Snorlax to run Giga Impact (which is a poor move choice if the Z-Move fails or is blocked, due to the recharge turn). It is primarily seen in "fun" or "gimmick" builds in Gen 7 formats rather than top-tier VGC or Smogon play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally useless on any Pokémon other than Snorlax. It is immune to the effects of the ability **Klutz** and moves like **Embargo**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it was originally distributed as an event item for early purchasers (Munchlax mystery gift). In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it can be obtained by showing a Snorlax to an NPC in Heahea City’s hotel (Tidewake Hotel).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique "Key Item" style held item that cannot be traded to other players if held by a Pokémon.
