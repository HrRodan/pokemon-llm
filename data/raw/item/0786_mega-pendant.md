## Identity & Utility
**Mega Pendant** is an **Unused Key Item** categorized under "unused" data, appearing in the game code during **Generation VI (Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire)** and **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A specialized necklace embedded with a Key Stone. It contains an ancient power that allows a Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. While functionally a Key Item, it is an NPC-specific asset and **cannot be obtained or used by the player**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unobtainable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the game's lore and NPC scripting, it acts as a **Key Stone** conduit. When the trainer (Wally) activates it, his Pokémon (typically Gallade) can Mega Evolve, provided it is holding its specific Mega Stone (Galladite).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists strictly within the code for NPC flavor and cannot be equipped or used in any competitive format (Smogon/VGC). Players use the *Mega Ring* or *Mega Bracelet* to achieve the same effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It interacts with **Mega Stones**. Unlike traditional evolution items (like Fire Stones), this triggers a temporary, mid-battle transformation rather than a permanent state change.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **unobtainable** through normal gameplay. It is hard-coded as a "hidden" item representing the specific accessory worn by the rival character **Wally** in the Hoenn remakes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, Wally receives this pendant after the player helps him catch his first Pokémon. It symbolizes his growth as a trainer, mirroring the player's Mega Bracelet. Although its metadata is tagged with **Generation VII (Alola)** in some databases, its primary narrative role is exclusive to the Hoenn region's storyline.
