## Identity & Utility
**Lum Berry** is a **Consumable Medicine (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A versatile berry that serves as a universal panacea for Pokémon. It can be used from the bag to treat a party member or held by a Pokémon to trigger an immediate, automatic recovery from any status ailment. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically purchasable but primarily acquired through cultivation or foraging.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Pokémon holds a Lum Berry, it will instantly consume it to cure **any major status condition** (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep) as well as **Confusion**. If used from the menu, it functions like a Full Heal.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (If flung at an ally or opponent, it cures their status condition).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Flying-type** attack with **80 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** It is frequently used on "setup sweepers" (e.g., Dragon Dance users) to prevent them from being stopped by a rogue Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave. It is also the premier choice for Pokémon using **Rest** (to wake up immediately) or moves like **Outrage/Thrash** (to cure the subsequent confusion).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Recycling:** Can be repeatedly reused in a single battle if the Pokémon has the **Harvest** or **Cud Chew** ability.
    * **Prevention:** The item's effect is nullified by the **Unnerve** or **Magic Room** abilities/effects.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on Berry trees across most regions or obtained via the **Pickup** ability (levels 11-100 depending on the game). In many titles, it is a reward for daily NPCs or grown in Berry Patches.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on rare and Mythical Pokémon, including **Mew**, **Celebi**, **Shaymin**, and occasionally **Chikorita**. Because it is held by Mythicals, it is often viewed in lore as a "miracle" fruit of high purity.
