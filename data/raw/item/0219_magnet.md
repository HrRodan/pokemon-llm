## Identity & Utility
**Magnet** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon. It is a powerful magnet that focuses electromagnetic energy to augment the holder's elemental output. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be bought or sold at a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Magnet increases the base power of the holder’s **Electric-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor physical damage; has no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **niche offensive item**. While often outclassed by the *Life Orb* (30% boost to all moves with recoil) or *Choice Specs* (50% boost to Special Attack but move-locking), the Magnet is preferred on Electric-type wallbreakers or pivots (like Magnezone or Zapdos) that require a damage boost without the HP drain or the restrictive nature of Choice items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a passive stat-modifier and is not consumed upon use in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in power plants, caves, or locations with high magnetic activity. In most regions, it can be purchased at specialized shops or found as a hidden item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously associated with magnetic Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Magneton**, **Nosepass**, and **Probopass**. Utilizing a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase hold rates), is the most efficient way to acquire multiple Magnets.
* **Historical Context:** Originally introduced as a 10% booster in earlier generations, it was buffed to 20% in Generation IV to keep pace with the power creep of competitive play.
