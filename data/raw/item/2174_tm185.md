## Identity & Utility
**TM185 (Lunge)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea region and its surrounding areas, this TM teaches the move **Lunge**. As a modern TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted at any TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale via traditional currency; requires League Points and materials for crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Lunge**. Lunge is a **Bug-type Physical move** with a base power of 80 and 100% accuracy. Its secondary effect is highly valuable: it is guaranteed to **lower the target's Attack stat by one stage** upon a successful hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in this generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** The move taught by TM185 is a **niche competitive utility**. It is primarily used on bulky physical attackers or "utility" Pokémon (such as Araquanid or Centiskorch) to simultaneously deal damage and neuter the offensive pressure of opposing physical sweepers. It is particularly effective in VGC (Double Battles) for debuffing threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** TM185 is consumed upon use. In Generation IX, players can recreate this item using the TM Machine if they have the necessary League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM185 was added specifically during the **Indigo Disk** expansion (The DLC for Scarlet & Violet). It can be found as a collectible item in the **Terarium** (specifically within the Savannah or Canyon Biomes) or crafted once the player has obtained the recipe.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To craft TM185, the player requires:
    1. **8,000 LP** (League Points)
    2. **3x Surskit Syrup**
    3. **3x Tarountula Thread**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found in the overworld or crafted using materials gathered from wild **Surskit** and **Tarountula**.
