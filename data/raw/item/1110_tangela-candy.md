## Identity & Utility
**Tangela Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with concentrated energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used on a specific evolutionary line to provide a comprehensive stat boost. Unlike standard vitamins, it is species-locked to Tangela and its evolution.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low internal price, it is rarely sold in shops and is instead earned through gameplay mechanics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Tangela** or **Tangrowth**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed) by **1 point** per candy. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Item cannot be held or used with Fling in the games where it appears).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is essential for maximizing a Pokémon's power within the *Let's Go* ecosystem. However, it has no presence or utility in traditional VGC or Smogon competitive formats, as those systems use Effort Values (EVs) rather than AVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates the "Awakening" mechanic for **Tangela** and **Tangrowth**. It cannot be administered to any other species, making it a targeted growth item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through **Transferring** Tangela to Professor Oak or by achieving high **Catch Combos** of wild Tangela. It can also be obtained by walking with a Tangela in the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item. Instead, it is a reward for the "Catch Combo" mechanic, encouraging trainers to specialize in catching this specific species to "farm" its unique candy.
