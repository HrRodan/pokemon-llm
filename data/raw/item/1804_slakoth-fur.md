## Identity & Utility
**Slakoth Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of fur dropped by the Slakoth evolutionary line. It is a consumable crafting component used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific TMs. It is a non-holdable material that serves as a specialized currency for move-learning.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Base Material Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a reagent for crafting Technical Machines. Players combine Slakoth Fur with League Points (LP) to produce reusable move-teaching items. Specifically, it is a required ingredient for crafting highly useful moves such as **TM060 (U-turn)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is strictly foundational, providing the means to acquire competitive moves like U-turn for a team's offensive pivots.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag and cannot be used directly on a Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching members of the Slakoth family in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a guaranteed or high-probability drop from:
    * **Slakoth**
    * **Vigoroth**
    * **Slaking**
* **Context:** Because Slakoth is often found in trees and is a rare spawn in certain biomes, Slakoth Fur can be more difficult to farm compared to common materials like Lechonk Hair, making it a slightly more prioritized material for players looking to mass-produce U-turn TMs.
