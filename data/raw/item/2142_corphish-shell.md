## Identity & Utility
**Corphish Shell** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fragment of a shell dropped by members of the Corphish evolutionary line. As a crafting component, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag and cannot be used directly in or out of battle.
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Minimal resale value; primarily intended for crafting rather than profit).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a resource at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. It is combined with League Points (LP) and other materials to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs) to teach moves to Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for the **move-learning economy** and provides no tactical benefit during a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it originates from Corphish, it is not required for Corphish to evolve into Crawdaunt (which occurs via leveling up). It is strictly a crafting ingredient.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Corphish** or **Crawdaunt**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense (it does not appear in the held item slot). Instead, it is automatically awarded to the player's inventory upon the successful defeat or capture of the associated Pokémon species.
* **World Context:** Introduced as part of the Paldean ecosystem's crafting mechanic, reflecting the biological components shed by Pokémon in the wild. High-tier TMs involving Water or Dark-type moves often require these shells as a base component.
