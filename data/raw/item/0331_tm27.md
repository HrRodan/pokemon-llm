## Identity & Utility
**TM27** is a Technical Machine (TM) categorized under **All-Machines**. While this specific data entry is tagged with **Generation III (Hoenn)**, it is a legacy item appearing in almost every major title from Generation I through Generation IX.

* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. Its identity has shifted significantly over the series: it taught **Fissure** in Gen I, the iconic **Return** from Gen II through Gen VII, and was repurposed for **Icy Wind** in Gen VIII.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. The specific move depends on the game version:
    * **Return (Gen II–VII):** A Normal-type physical attack whose power increases with the Pokémon's Friendship (maxing at 102 power).
    * **Icy Wind (Gen VIII):** An Ice-type special attack that lowers the target's Speed stat by one stage.
    * **Fissure (Gen I):** A Ground-type One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling in most generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Return:** Formerly a mandatory staple for physical attackers (like Snorlax or Mega Kangaskhan) due to its high reliability and power.
        * **Icy Wind:** A premier utility move in **VGC (Doubles)** for speed control, allowing players to dictate turn order.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** In modern games (Gen VIII+), TMs like this are often single-use unless they are categorized as "TRs" or if the game follows the Gen V–VII infinite-use mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * Historically, as **Return**, it was often rewarded by NPCs who evaluated the player's Pokémon's Friendship levels (e.g., the woman in Goldenrod City or the man in Pacifidlog Town).
    * In games like *Sword & Shield*, where it teaches **Icy Wind**, it is typically purchased from the **Cirrhichester** move shop or found in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM27 is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found as a "Poké Ball" item on the ground or purchased from Department Store TMs counters.
* **Legacy Context:** This TM is a prime example of "TM Number Rotation." While the number 27 remains constant, the move it teaches has evolved from an OHKO move to a friendship-based powerhouse, and finally to a tactical utility move.
