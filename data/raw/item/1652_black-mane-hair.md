## Identity & Utility
**Black Mane Hair** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra DLC).
* **Description:** This item is a tuft of smooth hair belonging to **Spectrier**, the "Swift Steed" and loyal companion of the King of Bountiful Harvests, Calyrex. It is a unique quest item that cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story-critical item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Black Mane Hair is a mandatory material used to craft the **Reins of Unity**. When combined with the **Radiant Flower** (grown from Icy/Shirley Carrots), the player provides these materials to Peony or Calyrex to create the artifact necessary for Calyrex to regain its fused form.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. As a Key Item, it exists only in the player's Bag to progress the narrative. However, it is the mechanical gatekeeper to obtaining **Calyrex (Shadow Rider)**, which is a premiere Uber-tier legendary in competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically tied to the legendary steed **Spectrier**. If the player chooses to plant the carrot seeds in the **Old Cemetery**, Spectrier will appear, leading to the acquisition of this specific hair variant.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively during the "The Sacred Bonds of Sovereign and Steed" questline in the **Crown Tundra**. After the player defends the town of Freezington from an attack by Spectrier, the spectral steed drops the hair, which the player then collects.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a one-time quest reward that disappears from the inventory once the Reins of Unity are crafted.
* **Lore Context:** The hair represents the physical manifestation of the bond—or the severed bond—between the King of Bountiful Harvests and his mount. Its smoothness is a direct contrast to the White Mane Hair of Glastrier, emphasizing Spectrier's ghostly and ethereal nature.
