## Identity & Utility
**Blue Sky Flower Pick** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used during the sandwich-making process at a Pokémon Picnic. It functions as a structural tool to secure ingredients and the top bun of a sandwich. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** During the sandwich-making mini-game, the player must place a pick to finish the sandwich. The Blue Sky Flower Pick serves this purpose, featuring a blue floral aesthetic. While picks are primarily cosmetic, they are a mechanical requirement to complete a sandwich and receive "Meal Powers" (buffs for Catching Rate, Egg Power, Shiny Hunting, etc.).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly for the **Picnic/Sandwich mechanic** and has no application in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts solely with the Gen IX sandwich-making engine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available at **Picnic Knacks** stores located in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a commercially manufactured picnic accessory. It is intended for trainers looking to customize the visual flair of their picnic spreads while hunting for specific Meal Powers.
