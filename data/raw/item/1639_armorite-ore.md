## Identity & Utility
**Armorite Ore** is a **Collectible** material introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar/Isle of Armor)**.
* **Description:** A rare, crystalline ore found exclusively on the Isle of Armor. It functions primarily as a unique regional currency rather than a standard item. While it can be held, its value lies in being traded to specific NPCs for high-value services.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Special Acquisition). While it has a nominal sell value, it is far more valuable as a bartering tool.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as specialized currency on the Isle of Armor. 
    * **Move Tutor:** At the Master Dojo, players can spend **3 Armorite Ore** to teach a Pokémon powerful exclusive moves (e.g., *Grassy Glide*, *Rising Voltage*, or *Triple Axel*).
    * **Digging Pa:** Near the Training Lowlands, players can give Armorite Ore to Digging Pa in exchange for massive quantities of **Watts**.
    * **Stat Reset:** A lady on a small island in the Workout Sea (Lady Clear) will completely reset a Pokémon's EVs (Effort Values) in exchange for **10 Armorite Ore**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no direct utility in battle**. However, it is **mechanically essential** for competitive preparation, as it is the only way to access several of the strongest moves in the Generation VIII meta and efficiently manage EV spreads.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily categorized as a "Material" or "Currency" rather than a consumable medicine or held power-item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Max Raid Battles:** The primary source of farming is completing Max Raid Battles within the Isle of Armor.
    * **Digging Ma:** An NPC who can be found randomly across the Isle of Armor; she offers to dig for Armorite Ore, though her shovel may break, costing the player the haul.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to raid rewards and environmental NPC interactions, reflecting its status as a "Rare Ore."
