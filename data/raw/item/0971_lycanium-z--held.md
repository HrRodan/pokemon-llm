## Identity & Utility
**Lycanium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (Species-Specific Held Item) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power specifically harmonized with the Lycanroc species. When held by a Lycanroc that knows the move *Stone Edge*, it allows the Pokémon to channel its energy into a unique, high-powered Z-Move. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Special Acquisition** item that cannot be sold or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Transforms the move **Stone Edge** into the exclusive Z-Move **Splintered Stormshards** (provided the user is Lycanroc). 
    * **Splintered Stormshards Details:** This is a physical Rock-type attack with **190 Base Power**. Its unique secondary effect is that it **eliminates any active Terrain** (Electric, Grassy, Misty, or Psychic Terrain) upon hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed from the holder by moves like Knock Off or Thief.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Gen VII Specialist).** This item turned Lycanroc (especially the Dusk form) into a potent "Terrain Breaker." In the Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon competitive meta, it was a primary tool for dismantling teams reliant on Tapu-induced terrains while providing a massive nuke to bypass defensive checks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to **Lycanroc** and functions for all three of its forms: Midday, Midnight, and Dusk. It interacts with the **Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring** held by the trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item cannot be purchased in Poké Marts. In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, the player receives this crystal after defeating **Hau** in a battle at Malie City after completing the trial at Mount Hokulani.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a Z-Crystal, it is unique and tied to the player's progress through the Island Challenge. It is immune to the effects of the **Pickup** ability or item-stealing moves.
