## Identity & Utility
**Dusk Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar, dark-as-shadow stone that triggers permanent biological changes in specific Pokémon species. It is a **Consumable** item that is used directly from the bag on a party member; it cannot be held for any passive benefit.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Pricing** for evolution stones).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the evolution of specific Ghost and Dark-type Pokémon. According to primary records, it facilitates the following transformations:
    * **Misdreavus** → **Mismagius**
    * **Murkrow** → **Honchkrow**
    * **Lampent** → **Chandelure**
    * **Doublade** → **Aegislash** (Contextual addition from later generations).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage for a non-combat item, though rarely used as the item is consumed upon use).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the stone itself provides no battle utility, it is the sole gateway to top-tier competitive threats like **Aegislash** (a former Uber/OU staple) and **Chandelure** (a high-special-attack Wallbreaker).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a single-use item. Once the evolution is triggered, the stone is consumed and disappears from the inventory. It does not interact with abilities like Klutz or Unnerve in any meaningful way beyond being a Fling projectile.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in locations associated with darkness or caves (e.g., Wayward Cave, Terminus Cave, or the Strange House). In many regions, it is not available in standard Poké Marts until the post-game, making it a rare mid-to-late-game resource.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon. However, it is a frequent reward in the **Pickup** ability table (typically for Pokémon level 31 and above) and can sometimes be obtained via the Super Training or Poke Pelago systems in various regions.
* **Lore:** Described as holding "shadows as dark as can be," the stone represents the concentrated essence of darkness, which explains its unique affinity for spectral and avian dark-type species.
