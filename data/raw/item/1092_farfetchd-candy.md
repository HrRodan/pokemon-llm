## Identity & Utility
**Farfetch'd Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable "packed with energy." Unlike generic Stat Candies (like Quick Candy), this item is tailored specifically for the Farfetch'd evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine/Enhancer** that can be sold but is generally not purchased from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal value, its primary "cost" is the time spent catching specific Pokémon species.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Farfetch'd**, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These points contribute to the **Awakening Values (AVs)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series, which allows a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Locked.** It is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats, as those rely on the traditional EV (Effort Value) system. It is, however, the most efficient way to "max out" a Farfetch'd for competitive play within the *Let's Go* ecosystem.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-booster. It bypasses the level-based stat caps of generic candies (which are restricted by the Pokémon's level), making it the superior choice for high-level optimization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!* by catching large quantities of Farfetch'd (Catch Combos) or by transferring Farfetch'd to Professor Oak in exchange for rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for the "farming" of the species.
* **World Knowledge Context:** Farfetch'd Candy represents the shift in Generation VII's Kanto remakes toward a more streamlined, "Go-style" training mechanic. It incentivizes the player to focus on specific species to reach their maximum potential, reflecting a bond formed through specialized nutrition. While the item exists in the game data for later generations, its utility is currently restricted to the *Let's Go* mechanics.
