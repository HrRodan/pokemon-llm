## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ori1852)** is a specialized event-based **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable/Single-use** item that is functionally a key to a specific encounter.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a technical cost of 20, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically acquired through external promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it generates a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal ID `ori1852`). This encounter persists until the Pokémon is defeated or until the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) raid encounters and cannot be held in a competitive battle. It is used to obtain Pokémon that may have Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors, which are relevant for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events (such as pre-order bonuses, retail distributions, or movie tie-ins). It is not found through normal gameplay or standard NPC vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a strictly promotional item delivered via the Mystery Gift feature. 
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent a way for players to access "Guaranteed Raids," bypassing the RNG (Random Number Generation) usually associated with Max Raid Dens and Wishing Pieces. The "ori" prefix in the internal name typically denotes specific distribution batches for regional retail partners.
