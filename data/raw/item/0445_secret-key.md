## Identity & Utility
**Secret Key** is a **Key Item** (classified under Event Items) introduced in **Generation I** (and re-indexed in Generation III).
* **Description:** A high-tech electronic key designed to emit a specific signal to unlock secured doors. As a Key Item, it resides in a dedicated pocket of the Bag, cannot be held by Pokémon, and cannot be traded or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique Quest/Event item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item's utility is region-specific and changes based on the game's narrative:
    * **Kanto (Gen I/III):** It is a mandatory story item used to unlock the **Cinnabar Island Gym**. Without it, players cannot challenge the Gym Leader, Blaine.
    * **Sinnoh (Gen IV - Platinum):** It is an event-exclusive item used in the **Galactic Eterna Building**. Using it near the TV on the ground floor reveals a hidden room.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the key itself has no battle stats, it is historically significant as the original gateway to **Rotom’s Alternate Forms**. In *Pokémon Platinum*, this item was required to access the appliances that transform Rotom into its Heat, Wash, Frost, Fan, and Mow forms—several of which (especially Rotom-Wash) became massive competitive staples.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the primary trigger for **Rotom's form changes** in the Sinnoh region. In later generations, this mechanic was replaced by the "Rotom Catalog," making this specific key a legacy event item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Kanto:** Located in the deepest basement of the **Pokémon Mansion** on Cinnabar Island. Its presence there is tied to the lore of the mansion's abandonment and the experiments involving Mewtwo.
    * **Sinnoh:** Distributed as a special **Mystery Gift** via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection for *Pokémon Platinum* players.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique plot-critical device that must be found or received through official events.
