## Identity & Utility
**TM178 (Gravity)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically via *The Teal Mask* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches the move **Gravity** to a compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX engine, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; crafted using **1,500 LP**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Gravity**. When used in battle, Gravity creates a field effect for 5 turns that:
    1.  **Grounds all Pokémon:** Flying-types, Pokémon with the Levitate ability, and those holding an Air Balloon become vulnerable to Ground-type moves and Arena Trap.
    2.  **Accuracy Boost:** Increases the accuracy of all moves used by any Pokémon on the field by approximately **1.67x**.
    3.  **Move Suppression:** Prevents the use of certain moves including Fly, Bounce, High Jump Kick, Jump Kick, Sky Drop, and Telekinesis.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic Staple.** Gravity is a core component of "Gravity Teams," used to ensure high-power, low-accuracy moves (like *Blizzard*, *Thunder*, or *Focus Blast*) never miss. It is also used strategically to allow powerful Ground-type attackers (like Groudon or Great Tusk) to hit Flying-type checks with *Precipice Blades* or *Earthquake*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily interacted with via the **TM Machine** crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Accessible only within the **Kitakami region** (The Teal Mask DLC). It can be found as a collectible item on the ground or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine after obtaining the recipe.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM, the player requires:
    * **1,500 LP**
    * **3x Bronzor Fragments**
    * **3x Staryu Fragments**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; the components required to craft it (Bronzor Fragments and Staryu Fragments) are farmed from wild **Bronzor**, **Bronzong**, **Staryu**, and **Starmie**.
