## Identity & Utility
**Magma Emblem** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A distinctive, medal-like item forged in the shape of the Team Magma insignia. As a Key Item, it is essential for story progression and cannot be sold, traded, or discarded. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a security clearance pass. When the player carries this item to the **Jagged Pass** (located on Mt. Chimney), it reacts to the environment to reveal the hidden entrance to the **Magma Hideout**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a purely narrative-driven item used for overworld progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. Its sole interaction is with the geography of the Hoenn region, specifically triggering a script to open a door that is otherwise invisible/inaccessible.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Emerald*, the player receives this item at the summit of **Mt. Pyre** after Team Magma has stolen the Red Orb (or Blue Orb, depending on version dynamics) and retreated. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact associated with the leadership of Team Magma.
* **Context:** The Magma Emblem is a core component of the "Weather Trio" climax in the Hoenn region, specifically leading the player to the encounter where Maxie attempts to awaken the super-ancient Pokémon, Groudon.
