## Identity & Utility
**Mosaic Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Stationery featuring a print of a vivid rainbow pattern. It is a consumable communication item that allows a Trainer to compose a message from a finite list of words and attach it to a Pokémon for delivery during trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates player-to-player communication. Once a message is written and the item is held by a Pokémon, it can be read by the recipient. The recipient can then erase the message to reuse the mail or store it in their PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Mail Shield:** While a Pokémon is holding Mosaic Mail, it is protected from certain item-manipulation mechanics. Moves that attempt to remove, steal, or swap the item (such as **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Covet**, or **Trick**) will fail. 
    * **Competitive Use:** Virtually non-existent in standard play. In very niche, historical contexts, Mail was occasionally used specifically to block **Trick** or **Knock Off**, but since the item provides no stat boosts or recovery, it is considered a wasted slot in competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Mosaic Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system; the Mail must be removed first.
    * **Consumable Nature:** While the paper can be "reused" after erasing a message, it is functionally a social tool rather than a combat consumable.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Poké Marts and specialty shops throughout the Sinnoh region (notably in Hearthome City).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or received from NPCs.
* **Lore context:** Mosaic Mail represents the colorful, social nature of the Generation IV GTS (Global Trade Station) era, where personalized messages added a layer of personality to the burgeoning online trade community.
