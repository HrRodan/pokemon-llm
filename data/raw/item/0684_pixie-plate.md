## Identity & Utility
**Pixie Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with Fairy-type energy. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is primarily used to augment the power of Fairy-type attacks or alter the physiology of specific legendary Pokémon. While it has a defined internal cost, it is rarely found in standard retail environments.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Relatively cheap/Moderate value, though typically obtained as a unique find rather than purchased).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of all **Fairy-type moves** by **20%**. 
* **Legendary Interaction (Arceus):** This item is essential for the Pokémon **Arceus**. Holding the Pixie Plate changes Arceus’s type to **Fairy** (via the Multitype ability) and changes the type of its signature move, **Judgment**, to Fairy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a staple for **Arceus-Fairy** in high-tier competitive formats (like Ubers or Anything Goes), providing a necessary defensive and offensive typing to check powerful Dragon-types. For non-legendary Pokémon, it serves as a niche alternative to *Life Orb* or *Choice Specs* when a trainer wants to boost Fairy-type damage without recoil or move-locking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the **Multitype** ability. It cannot be removed via *Trick* or *Thief* if held by Arceus.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically discovered in late-game areas, hidden locations, or through specific NPC events (e.g., found in the Pokémon Village in Kalos or via the Grand Underground/Great Marsh in other regions). It is generally not available in Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held** by any wild Pokémon. It is considered a rare relic rather than a naturally occurring object.
* **Lore Context:** One of the various Plates said to be fragments of the original power used to shape the universe. The Pixie Plate specifically represents the essence of the Fairy type, which was discovered (or categorized) simultaneously with this item in Generation VI.
