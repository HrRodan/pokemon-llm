## Identity & Utility
**Poliwag Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutritional supplement packed with species-specific energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used in the overworld to permanently enhance a Pokémon's performance. It is restricted to the Poliwag evolutionary line (Poliwag, Poliwhirl, Poliwrath, and Politoed).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal value, it is rarely purchased and instead earned through gameplay loops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a member of the Poliwag family, it increases **all six stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a stat-buffing system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic does not exist in the games where this item is present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is essential for "maxing out" a Pokémon's potential in the *Let's Go* competitive meta, where AVs replace the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. It allows a Pokémon to exceed its standard base stat limitations significantly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon use and cannot be held by Pokémon to be used in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary acquisition is through the **Pokémon Storage System** mechanics. Trainers receive these candies by catching large quantities of Poliwag (Catch Combos) or by transferring Poliwag to **Professor Oak**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through the "Catching" and "Transferring" gameplay loop rather than through abilities like **Pickup**.
* **World Context:** Unlike generic candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy), Species Candies are the most efficient way to raise AVs, as they bypass the stat-specific requirements of standard candies and provide a universal boost to the specific genetic line.
