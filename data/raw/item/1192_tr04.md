## Identity & Utility
**TR04 (Surf)** is a **Technical Record** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item used to teach a Pokémon the move **Surf**. Unlike TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, representing a return to the consumable mechanic for high-value moves. 
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily acquired via Watt Traders in the Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Surf** to compatible Pokémon. Surf is a Special Water-type move with **90 Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It targets all adjacent Pokémon in double battles (including allies).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Surf is one of the most reliable Water-type moves in the game. In Singles, it is preferred for its perfect accuracy compared to Hydro Pump. In Doubles/VGC, it is used as a powerful spread move, often paired with allies that have the **Water Absorb** or **Storm Drain** abilities to trigger healing or stat boosts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR04 is primarily obtained by defeating Water-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area. Its availability fluctuates daily based on the traders' rotating inventories.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be earned through raid completion or currency exchange. In the Galar ecosystem, TRs represent concentrated move data that is lost upon transfer to the Pokémon.
