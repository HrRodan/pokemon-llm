## Identity & Utility
**Dark Stone** is a Plot Advancement item introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The Dark Stone is the dormant, crystalline form of the Legendary Pokémon **Zekrom**. According to Unova mythology, Zekrom's physical body was destroyed and compressed into this stone after the war between the twin heroes, where it now waits for a new hero to awaken it. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Key Item/Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as the essential plot device to summon **Zekrom** for the final confrontation against N in *Pokémon White*. It serves a similar narrative role in *Pokémon Black 2*, where it is used to encounter Zekrom at Dragonspiral Tower.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for story progression and post-game legendary encounters. It provides no statistical or tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is the counterpart to the **Light Stone** (Reshiram). It is required for the player to capture Zekrom, which can then be fused with Kyurem using the DNA Splicers to create **Black Kyurem**.
