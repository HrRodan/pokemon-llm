## Identity & Utility
**TM218 (Expanding Force)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** A specialized move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Expanding Force**. As of Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, this item is not purchased with standard currency but is instead crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Expanding Force**, a Psychic-type Special attack with a base power of 80 and 100% accuracy.
* **Secondary Mechanics (Expanding Force):** 
    * When **Psychic Terrain** is active, the move's power increases by 1.5x (to 120 BP).
    * In Double Battles, if Psychic Terrain is active, the move targets **both opposing Pokémon** simultaneously.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Expanding Force is the cornerstone of "Psychic Spam" archetypes in VGC (Doubles). It is most effectively used alongside Pokémon with the *Psychic Surge* ability (notably **Indeedee-F** or **Tapu Lele**) to immediately trigger the move’s power boost and AOE capabilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used by Psychic-type Special attackers (e.g., Armarouge, Hatterene, Iron Valiant).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk). Once picked up, the recipe is added to the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM218, trainers typically require **League Points (LP)** and specific Pokémon drops, often associated with Psychic-type families (such as Ralts Beads or Hattrem Ribbons).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured human-made device.
