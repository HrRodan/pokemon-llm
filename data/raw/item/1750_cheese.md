## Identity & Utility
**Cheese** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A versatile dairy product used as a component in the Picnic sandwich-making mechanic. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought at dedicated grocery outlets. While it lacks direct utility in battle, it is a foundational element for crafting Meal Powers that influence world encounters and training.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Cheese contributes to specific **Meal Powers**. It primarily provides boosts to **Exp. Point Power**, **Raid Power**, and **Item Drop Power**. In terms of type-flavor profiles, it is frequently associated with the **Ice**, **Ghost**, and **Normal** types depending on the supporting ingredients.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item exists strictly for the sandwich-making mini-game and providing out-of-battle buffs. It cannot be used as a held item in Smogon or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used in the Picnic sub-menu to modify encounter rates, shiny odds (if combined with Herba Mystica), and experience gain.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** locations and **Aquiesta Supermarkets** throughout the Paldea region. It is unlocked for purchase early in the game, making it a staple for early-game experience grinding via sandwiches.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, Cheese must be purchased from vendors or occasionally received as a reward from NPCs in the overworld.
