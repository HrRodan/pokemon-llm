## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Per1131** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once consumed, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn, which remains active until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**). While the internal data lists a cost of 20, this item is not sold in Poké Marts; it is an event-exclusive distribution item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal variable data). This encounter typically features a rare Pokémon or one with the Gigantamax factor.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** The item itself has no battle utility. However, Dynamax Crystals were historically used to give players early or version-exclusive access to competitive staples (such as Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax-capable species) during the Sword & Shield era.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** as part of retail promotions (e.g., pre-order bonuses, CoroCoro Magazine distributions, or physical store events like GameStop or GAME). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a promotional distribution item and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces which trigger random raids, these "Per" designated crystals are tuned to specific Pokémon signatures, allowing trainers to summon a precise Max Raid encounter.
