## Identity & Utility
**Beedrillite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in Generation VI (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*), though it remains a significant specialized item in Generation VII.
* **Description:** A mysterious, radiating stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by a Beedrill, it allows the Pokémon to transcend its final stage during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Z-Power Ring. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically a unique find or BP reward).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Beedrill, the "Mega Evolve" option becomes available in the battle menu. Upon activation, Beedrill transforms into **Mega Beedrill**, significantly increasing its Attack and Speed stats and replacing its ability with **Adaptability** (which increases the multiplier for Same Type Attack Bonus moves from 1.5x to 2x).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In standard play, Mega Stones cannot be removed from the holder by moves like Trick, Switcheroo, or Fling if the holder is the corresponding Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Niche Powerhouse).** Mega Beedrill is the definition of a "Glass Cannon." It is a competitive staple in tiers like Smogon UU (UnderUsed) or specific VGC formats where Mega Evolution is permitted. Its high speed and U-turn pivoting make it an elite scout and late-game cleaner.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution; the transformation is temporary and lasts only for the duration of the battle. It is unaffected by the ability *Klutz* for the purposes of Mega Evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Sun/Moon* and *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*, Beedrillite is not found in the overworld during the main story; it was originally distributed via Poke Link as a competitive reward and later made available at the **Battle Tree** for 64 Battle Points (BP). In its debut (*ORAS*), it was found in the Sea Mauville.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or Thief-style moves.
* **Lore context:** Mega Stones are often described as life energy crystallized, reacting to the bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon. The Beedrillite specifically resonates with Beedrill’s biological structure to overclock its venom production and wing speed.
