## Identity & Utility
**Cubchoo Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation 9 (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting resource dropped by members of the Cubchoo evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** used exclusively at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. While it has a listed cost, it is primarily used as a secondary currency alongside League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). In-game, this value typically represents its exchange rate for League Points or its minor sell value at marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). It is consumed upon the creation of a move disc.
* **Crafting Applications:** Based on world knowledge of the Paldean TM system, Cubchoo Fur is a vital component for Ice-type utility and offensive moves, most notably:
    * **TM135 (Ice Beam)**
    * **TM143 (Blizzard)**
    * **TM022 (Chilling Water)**
    * **TM052 (Snowscape)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials cannot be used effectively with Fling and provide no competitive held-item benefit).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy to provide Pokémon with expanded movepools.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Cubchoo** or **Beartic**. It is not sold in traditional Poke Marts but can be exchanged for League Points at the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is part of the "Let's Go!" auto-battle reward system and standard encounter rewards in the Paldea region and the North Province (Area Three) specifically.
* **Context:** The fur is noted for its insulating properties, reflecting the Cubchoo line's adaptation to freezing environments, which translates into the "Ice-type" moves it helps generate.
