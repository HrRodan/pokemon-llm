## Identity & Utility
**Hamburger** is a **sandwich-ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A processed meat patty used specifically as a component in the sandwich-making mechanic during Picnics. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that can be purchased at dedicated grocery vendors.
* **Cost:** 380 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, the Hamburger contributes to the "Savory" and "Sour" flavor profiles. It is a staple ingredient for several recipes, most notably influencing **Encounter Power**, **Catching Power**, and **Raid Power**, particularly for **Steel-type** Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients generally cannot be held or used with Fling in a competitive battle context).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held by a Pokémon or used during a battle sequence. Its value is strictly relegated to the **Overworld/Picnic** mechanics for boosting shiny odds, experience gain, or encounter rates.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Sandwich/Picnic system** and does not trigger abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** outlets and **Aquiesta Supermarkets** throughout the Paldea region. It becomes readily available early in the player's journey.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through commercial purchase or as a reward from NPCs for participating in sandwich-related activities.
