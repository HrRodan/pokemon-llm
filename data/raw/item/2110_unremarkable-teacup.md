## Identity & Utility
**Unremarkable-teacup** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask).
* **Description:** A simple, well-used teacup that appears plain and common. Despite its name, it serves as a specific catalyst for evolution for certain Pokémon found in the Kitakami region. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the evolution of a **Counterfeit Form Poltchageist** into **Sinistcha**. Unlike the Masterpiece Teacup, which is used for the rare Artisan Form, this item is used for the far more common "unremarkable" variety of the species.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard physical damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. It has no direct combat utility as a held item. Its value is strictly preparation-based, allowing trainers to obtain **Sinistcha**, a potent competitive Pokémon known for its "Hospitality" ability and "Matcha Gotcha" signature move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon use. It only functions on Poltchageist that lack the "stamp of authenticity" on the bottom of their vessel.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily located within the **Kitakami** region. It can be found as a collectible item in the **Paradise Barrens** (often tucked away in caves) or rewarded through the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame. In some instances, it may appear in specialized shops or auctions within the Paldea/Kitakami circuit.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is generally tied to overworld exploration or clearing specific regional challenges. It is functionally the Kitakami counterpart to the **Cracked Pot** found in the Galar region.
