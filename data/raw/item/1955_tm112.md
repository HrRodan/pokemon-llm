## Identity & Utility
**TM112 (Aura Sphere)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced as this specific index in **Generation IX (The Indigo Disk - Scarlet & Violet DLC)**.
* **Description:** A single-use machine that teaches the move **Aura Sphere** to compatible Pokémon. As a TM in the modern era, it is consumable upon use but can be replicated if the player has the necessary materials. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that cannot be bought with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via exploration or the TM Machine using 8,000 LP and specific Pokémon materials).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Aura Sphere**. 
    * **Move Details:** Fighting-type, Special, 80 Power.
    * **Secondary Effect:** The move is guaranteed to hit the target regardless of accuracy or evasion modifiers (unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** Aura Sphere is a premier Fighting-type coverage move for Special Attackers. Its "never-miss" property makes it a hard counter to "Minimize" or "Double Team" strategies and provides reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for Pokémon like Lucario, Togekiss, and legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo or Dialga.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the TM Machine crafting system, requiring **Riolu Fur** and **Ralts Dust** to manufacture.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item in the **Terarium** (specifically within the Polar Biome or as a reward for Blueberry Quest milestones). Once obtained, the recipe is unlocked at any TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. In the context of *Scarlet & Violet*, players must farm materials from wild **Riolu** and **Ralts** to craft multiple copies of this TM.
