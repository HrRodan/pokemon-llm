## Identity & Utility
**Clauncher Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by the Clauncher evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable/Crafting** item that is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. While it has a nominal sell price, its true value lies in move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; often converted into 50 League Points [LP]).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). It has no direct effect in battle or on a Pokémon's stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Zero direct viability.** It is an out-of-battle resource. However, it is essential for the "Teambuilding" phase of competitive play, as it is required to craft high-value TMs for specialized movepools.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a material for the Gen IX crafting economy. It interacts with the **Technical Machine Machine** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Clauncher** or **Clawitzer**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; it is dropped directly into the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of a battle.
* **Context:** In the Paldea region and the Terarium (Blueberry Academy), trainers farm these claws by seeking out Clauncher in aquatic biomes. Because Clauncher is a version-exclusive (Pokémon Violet), this material is more naturally abundant in that version, though it can be obtained in Pokémon Scarlet through Tera Raid Battles or Union Circle play.
