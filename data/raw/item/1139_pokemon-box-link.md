## Identity & Utility
**Pokémon Box Link** is a Gameplay Utility item introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A high-tech device that grants the player remote access to the Pokémon Storage System (PC Boxes) from nearly anywhere in the overworld. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold, representing a permanent upgrade to the player's UI and party management capabilities.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the menu, it opens the Pokémon Storage System, allowing the player to swap party members, deposit Pokémon, or withdraw new ones without visiting a Pokémon Center.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Utility).** While it has no impact on the math of a battle, it is a "Quality of Life" staple for competitive players, allowing them to swap between different training sets or teams while in the Wild Area without backtracking to a town.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is a pure management tool. It functions as a specialized "Link" to the PC, effectively replacing the physical PC terminals found in older generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, the player receives this item from Sonia at the Meetup Spot shortly after entering the Wild Area for the first time. 
* **Restrictions:** The device is programmed with location-based locks. It cannot be used within Pokémon Gyms, during the Galar Star Tournament, or in specific "gauntlet" areas where team changes are restricted for narrative or challenge purposes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. As a unique Key Item, it cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
