## Identity & Utility
**TR55 (Flare Blitz)** is an **all-machines** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Record (TR) is a single-use machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Flare Blitz**. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, TRs break after a single use, mimicking the consumable nature of older generation TMs.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/High Value). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for **Watts** in its debut generation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flare Blitz**, a powerful Fire-type physical attack. 
    * **Move Stats:** 120 Power / 100% Accuracy.
    * **Mechanics:** The user sustains recoil damage equal to 1/3 of the damage dealt. It has a 10% chance to burn the target and thaws the user if they are frozen.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 120. This is one of the highest possible Fling damage values in the game, making it a viable emergency high-damage projectile.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Competitive Staple).** Flare Blitz is the premier physical Fire-type move for high-tier threats like Arcanine, Darmanitan, and Cinderace. TR55 is essential for physical attackers that do not learn the move via level-up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR55 is primarily obtained by defeating Fire-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** within the Wild Area. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** for a variable amount of Watts (typically 3,000 - 8,000 W) depending on the daily rotation.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Its acquisition is tied strictly to Galar's raid economy and specialized vendors.
