## Identity & Utility
**Stantler Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of hair shed by a Stantler. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific TMs. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any benefit.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Low material value; primarily used for its crafting utility rather than sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory component for crafting Technical Machines. In Paldea, this material is specifically required to craft high-value moves, including **TM114 (Shadow Ball)** and **TM120 (Psychic)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it has no presence in VGC or Smogon formats. Its value is purely preparatory, allowing trainers to teach essential coverage and STAB moves to their competitive roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While Stantler evolves into Wyrdeer via the use of Psyshield Bash (in *Legends: Arceus*) or through specific level-up triggers in other games, **Stantler Hair** is not an evolution item. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Stantler** or its evolution, **Wyrdeer**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; rather, it is automatically added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Stantler line. 
* **Lore Context:** Introduced as part of the Paldean ecosystem's resource-gathering mechanic, reflecting the biological traits of the Pokémon (shedding hair/fur) to facilitate the "DIY" approach to move-learning in modern titles.
