## Identity & Utility
**Beast Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A highly specialized, sci-fi inspired Poké Ball engineered specifically to deal with extra-dimensional threats. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts. Its utility is bifurcated: it is an essential tool for catching Ultra Beasts but acts as a significant handicap when used against terrestrial Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is derived from its rarity and specialized function rather than commercial availability.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Beast Ball features a conditional catch rate modifier. When used against an **Ultra Beast** (e.g., Nihilego, Pheromosa, Guzzlord), it applies a **5× Catch Rate multiplier**, making it the most effective tool for these encounters. Conversely, when used against any non-Ultra Beast Pokémon, it applies a **0.1× Catch Rate multiplier**—making it ten times less effective than a standard Poké Ball.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard Poké Balls generally have a Fling power of 30, but provide no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no tactical advantage in battle, the Beast Ball is a high-tier **"Aesthetic Flex"** in competitive scenes. Because of the 0.1× catch modifier, having a standard Pokémon (like a Pseudo-Legendary) inside a Beast Ball signifies extreme patience or luck in the catching/breeding process. The distinct blue-and-yellow "digital hexagonal" entry animation is highly sought after by collectors and VGC players.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a key component of the "Aesthetic Breeding" subculture, as the ball type can be passed down to offspring via breeding (except for Master/Cherish Balls).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally developed by the **Aether Foundation**. In its debut (Sun/Moon), players were supplied with these by Looker during the post-game Ultra Beast missions. In later generations (Gen VIII and IX), it has become an "Apriball-tier" rarity, obtainable only via specific milestones like **Pokédex Completion rewards**, the **Ace Academy Tournament**, or the **Cram-o-matic**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to NPC gifts, special rewards, or the **Delibird Presents** auction in Porto Marinada (at extremely high prices).
