## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA4434)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-based consumable item designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It acts as a beacon to summon a specific powerful Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Not for Sale**; while the internal value is low, this item is a rare distribution-only asset).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle featuring a predetermined Pokémon (associated with the DRA4434 code, typically **Duraludon** in retail distributions). The raid remains active until the battle is won or until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a Max Raid Battle to catch a Pokémon or farm Raid rewards (like Exp. Candies and TRs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** node in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Exclusive Item**. It was primarily distributed via serial codes as a pre-order bonus or through specific retail partnerships (such as local game stores or magazine promotions). It is not available for purchase at Poke Marts or found via standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via the **Mystery Gift** function as a physical item placed in the "Other" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag.
