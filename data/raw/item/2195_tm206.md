## Identity & Utility
**TM206 (Petal Blizzard)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that grants a compatible Pokémon the move **Petal Blizzard**. In the Paldea and Terarium regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be manufactured at any TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires crafting via the **TM Machine**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Petal Blizzard**. 
    * **Move Type:** Grass (Physical).
    * **Stats:** Power: 90 | Accuracy: 100% | PP: 15.
    * **Targeting:** In Double Battles, this move hits all adjacent Pokémon, including the user's ally, making it a "spread move" similar to Earthquake.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** While Petal Blizzard provides reliable Physical Grass-type damage, it is often overshadowed by *Leaf Blade* (higher crit ratio/no ally damage) or *Wood Hammer* (higher power). Its primary use is on Physical Grass attackers in VGC who can capitalize on spread damage or trigger an ally's ability (like *Sap Sipper*).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be remade indefinitely if the player has the required resources.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Indigo Disk (Generation IX DLC)**. It can be obtained as a reward for exploration in the Terarium or by defeating specific Trainers. Once found, it is unlocked for crafting at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To manufacture TM206, the player typically requires:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Hoppip Leaf**
    * **3x Petilil Leaf**
    * **3x Bounsweet Sweat**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials for its creation are gathered by defeating members of the **Hoppip, Petilil, and Bounsweet** evolutionary lines.
