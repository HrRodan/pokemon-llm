## Identity & Utility
**Sandshrew Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A crafting component consisting of a sharp claw shed by a Sandshrew. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. It is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs.
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Minor resale value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific currency requirement for crafting Technical Machines (TMs) at Pokémon Centers. It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to produce specific moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Item cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. The item has no direct utility in competitive play; however, it is essential for the "Teambuilding" phase to teach Pokémon necessary moves that are not learned via leveling up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized strictly as a resource for the Generation IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by members of the Sandshrew evolutionary line (Sandshrew and Sandslash) upon their defeat or capture in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item," it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Sandshrew** and **Sandslash**. In the Paldea region and the Terarium (Blueberry Academy), players farm these by battling Sandshrew in desert or rocky biomes. They can also be found as sparkling dropped items on the ground in habitats where Sandshrew are known to burrow.
