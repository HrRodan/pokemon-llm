## Identity & Utility
**Mega-Stickpin** is an **Unused Key Item** (categorized as "unused" in game data) introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Omega Ruby & Alpha Sapphire*), though it remains in the code through **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** This accessory is a specialized **Key Stone** holder. Its flavor text indicates it contains an "untold power" that facilitates Mega Evolution for Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a player's Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In terms of lore and NPC mechanics, it functions as a **Key Stone**. It allows a Trainer to trigger the Mega Evolution of a Pokémon during battle, provided the Pokémon is holding its respective Mega Stone. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As an unobtainable NPC item, it has no presence in the competitive VGC or Smogon formats. Players use the *Mega Ring* (Gen VI) or *Mega Bracelet* (Gen VII) to achieve the same effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific item is coded as the trigger for **Steven Stone’s** Mega Evolution, most notably used to evolve his **Metagross** into **Mega Metagross**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** While it exists in the internal data of *Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, it is an "NPC-only" item. It was designed specifically for the character **Steven Stone** in the Hoenn remakes to serve as his version of the Mega Ring.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique signature item tied to the Hoenn Champion's character design.
