## Identity & Utility
**TM96 (Nature Power)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that grants a Pokémon the move **Nature Power**. This move is unique because it is a status-category move that transforms into a specific damaging attack based on the current battlefield environment (terrain). In modern generations (Gen V onwards), TMs are permanent and not consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Nature Power** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Nature Power Mechanics:** When used, it calls a different move depending on the environment. For example:
        * **Electric Terrain:** Becomes *Thunderbolt*.
        * **Grassy Terrain:** Becomes *Energy Ball*.
        * **Misty Terrain:** Becomes *Moonblast*.
        * **Psychic Terrain:** Becomes *Psychic*.
        * **Regular Buildings/Link Battles:** Often becomes *Tri Attack*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Tactical.** Nature Power is highly valued on Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability (like Whimsicott). Since Nature Power is classified as a status move, Prankster gives it +1 priority, allowing the user to fire off powerful offensive moves like *Moonblast* or *Energy Ball* before the opponent can act. It is also a staple on **Terrain-based teams** in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "natural" Pokémon, particularly Grass, Normal, and Fairy types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available for purchase at Pokémon Marts (such as the Ambrette Town Mart in X/Y) or gifted by NPCs associated with nature or fossil research. Its low cost makes it an easily accessible utility for mid-game progression.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured machine. It is typically acquired through exploration or purchase rather than farming via the **Pickup** ability.
