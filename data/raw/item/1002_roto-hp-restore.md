## Identity & Utility
**Roto HP Restore** is a **Special Battle Support Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is one of the specialized "Rotom Powers" unique to the Alola region's upgraded Rotom Pokédex. It is a consumable battle charm that fully heals the user's active Pokémon. Unlike standard medicines, it represents a bond between the trainer and their Rotom Dex. It is a **Consumable** item that **Cannot** be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated during a battle, it fully restores the HP of the Pokémon currently on the field, functioning similarly to a Max Potion but accessed through the Rotom Power interface.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None/Banned.** Rotom Powers are restricted to single-player gameplay in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. They are unavailable in Link Battles, Battle Tree, VGC, or Smogon formats. In a casual playthrough or Nuzlocke, it serves as a powerful "get out of jail free" card during difficult boss fights like Ultra Necrozma.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly tied to the **Roto Loto** mechanic and cannot be intercepted by abilities like Thief or Knock Off since it is not a held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a random reward from the **Roto Loto** minigame in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*. The player must interact with the Rotom Dex when its eyes flash gold to spin for a prize.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is generated digitally by the Rotom Dex based on the player's friendship level with the device. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
