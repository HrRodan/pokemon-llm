## Identity & Utility
**Shiny Charm** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** A specialized charm that permanently increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon. It is a **Key Item** that remains in the player's inventory as a passive buff; it cannot be held by a Pokémon, consumed, or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item/Special Acquisition**). It cannot be purchased and has no resale value.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Shiny Charm significantly boosts the Shiny encounter rate. Mechanically, it adds **two additional "rolls"** or checks for shininess whenever the game generates a Pokémon. 
    * *Standard Odds:* From Generation VI onward, the base rate is 1/4096. With the Shiny Charm, the rate becomes approximately **1/1365.33** (3/4096).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on battle statistics, move accuracy, or damage. Its utility is strictly limited to the "Shiny Hunting" meta-game and collection.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve any Pokémon, it synergizes with the **Masuda Method** (breeding two Pokémon from different real-world languages). When combined with the Masuda Method, the Shiny odds improve even further (typically to 1/512).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Shiny Charm is traditionally awarded as a prestigious prize for completing the **Pokédex**. 
    * In Generation V and VI, it required completion of the **National Pokédex**.
    * From Generation VII (Sun/Moon) onwards, it is typically awarded for completing the **Regional Pokédex**.
    * It is usually obtained by speaking to the region's Professor or a representative of Game Freak located within the game world.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-per-save-file achievement item.
