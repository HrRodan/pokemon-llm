## Identity & Utility
**Dratini Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike standard candies that target specific stats (e.g., Quick Candy for Speed), this item is restricted to the **Dratini evolutionary line**. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that provides a comprehensive boost to a Pokémon's performance.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low nominal cost, it is primarily an earned resource rather than a store-bought commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a **Dratini, Dragonair, or Dragonite**, it increases **all of their stats simultaneously** by 1 point. In the *Let's Go* engine, this adds to the Pokémon's **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series competitive meta. It is essential for "Candy-training" a Dragonite to its maximum potential, as it allows a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat, vastly exceeding the traditional Effort Value (EV) system used in other generations. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon use and is ineffective on any Pokémon outside the Dratini family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily through the **Catch Combo** mechanic; catching large numbers of Dratini in succession increases the likelihood of receiving these candies. They are also rewarded when a trainer transfers members of the Dratini line to **Professor Oak**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a reward for catching or transferring them. In the context of the Alola-era Generation VII (where it was technically indexed), it serves as a bridge between *Pokémon GO* mechanics and console gameplay.
