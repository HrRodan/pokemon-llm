## Identity & Utility
**Surskit Syrup** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A crafting reagent dropped by members of the Surskit evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon from the bag. In the Paldean economy, it is used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM).
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs). It is consumed upon the creation of the move disc. Specifically, it is required for crafting:
    * **TM021 (Pounce)**
    * **TM050 (Rain Dance)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect utility only.** While the syrup itself has no competitive presence, it is essential for teaching competitive staples like *Rain Dance* to team members in the Scarlet/Violet meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Surskit** or **Masquerain**. It can also be found as a sparkling pickup in wetlands or ponds where these Pokémon reside.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense but is a **guaranteed/semi-common drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Surskit line. It is frequently gathered in bulk during "Mass Outbreaks" to farm League Points or craft high-demand TMs.
