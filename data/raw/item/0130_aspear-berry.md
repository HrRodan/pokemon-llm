## Identity & Utility
**Aspear Berry** is a **Consumable Medicine (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A sour green berry used to thaw a frozen Pokémon. It is a **Holdable Consumable** that can be used manually from the Bag or triggered automatically in battle. As part of the fundamental status-curing berry set, it serves as the specific antidote for the Frozen condition.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, it immediately cures a Pokémon of the **Frozen** status. If held by a Pokémon, the berry is consumed instantly the moment the holder becomes frozen, curing the status without using a turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Upon hitting a target, it cures the target's Frozen status).
    * **Natural Gift:** (World Knowledge) Converts to an **Ice-type** move with 80 Power (Gen IV-VI) or 60 Power (Gen VII+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Situational.** In high-level competitive play (VGC/Smogon), the Aspear Berry is rarely seen because the Frozen status is typically a low-probability secondary effect of Ice moves (usually 10%). Players usually opt for a **Lum Berry**, which cures all status conditions, rather than specializing in freeze-curing.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. It interacts with abilities like **Harvest** (allows the berry to be regained after use) and **Unnerve** (prevents the opponent from eating the berry).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available in the overworld via Berry Trees and Soil Patches. It can be purchased at specialized Berry shops or from the Berry Master in various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently carried by Ice-type Pokémon or those inhabiting cold climates, including wild **Seel, Dewgong, Jynx, Swinub, Piloswine, Smoochum, Cubchoo, Beartic,** and **Crabrawler**. These can be harvested using moves like *Thief* or *Covet*.
