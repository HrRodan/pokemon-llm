## Identity & Utility
**Black-augurite** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically in the Hisui region of *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** A glass-like black stone that is as hard as diamond. It is a specialized, consumable evolution catalyst used to trigger specific regional transformations. It cannot be purchased with standard Poké Dollars and is considered a rare find.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale via traditional Marts; typically acquired through Merit Points, exploration, or drops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a **Scyther**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Kleavor** (a Bug/Rock-type Pokémon). Unlike trade-based evolutions, this item is used directly from the inventory.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Items in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* do not utilize the Fling mechanic in the traditional sense, and its power is undefined in later standard entries).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no utility in battle, it is the exclusive gateway to obtaining **Kleavor**, a Pokémon utilized in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) for its unique "Sharpness" ability and "Stone Axe" signature move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a single-use consumable. Once the evolution of Scyther into Kleavor is complete, the item is removed from the inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hisui region, it can be purchased from the **Trading Post** for 1,000 Merit Points (MP). It is also obtainable as a hidden item found by scanning the terrain with **Ride Ursaluna**.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not typically held by Pokémon in the wild in standard games, but in the Hisui region, it is a rare drop from defeating or catching wild **Graveler**. It can also be found within space-time distortions.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents the rugged, volcanic nature of the ancient Hisui region, providing Scyther with the mineral-rich carapace required to become Kleavor.
