## Identity & Utility
**Health-Wing** (also known as the HP Wing) is a **Vitamin** consumable introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal feather that slightly increases a Pokémon's HP base points (EVs). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought and sold. Unlike traditional Vitamins like HP Up, which provide larger boosts, the Health-Wing is designed for fine-tuned incremental growth.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon, it increases its **HP Effort Values (EVs) by 1**. It is consumed after one use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While **HP Up** is used for bulk training (+10 EVs), the Health-Wing is a **Competitive Staple for Precision Tuning**. Competitive players use Wings to reach specific EV benchmarks (e.g., hitting an odd HP number to maximize Substitute usage or minimize Stealth Rock damage) without overshooting the 510 total EV cap.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. In Generations V through VII, it was particularly valuable because it could be used to raise EVs even after a stat had reached 100 points, a limitation that applied to standard Vitamins at the time.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found as "hidden" or "sparkling" items on bridges in the Unova region (specifically **Driftveil Bridge** and **Marvelous Bridge**), often dropped by shadows of flying Pokémon. In later generations, they are common rewards from Max Raid Battles, Tera Raid Battles, or found as sparkling floor items in various Wild Areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. They are primarily environmental acquisitions or earned through battle challenges. Because they are often found in "shadows" on bridges, they are lore-distinguished from standard manufactured medicine as natural shed feathers with therapeutic properties.
