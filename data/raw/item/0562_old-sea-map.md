## Identity & Utility
**Old Sea Map** is an **Event Item (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A faded, ancient sea chart that depicts the coordinates to a secluded, mysterious location. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold; it is strictly an event-exclusive distribution item.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is tied entirely to its status as a rare event trigger.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held in the inventory, it grants the player passage via the **S.S. Tidal** (from Lilycove City) to **Faraway Island**. Upon arrival, the player can navigate the island's tall grass to encounter and capture a wild **Mew** (Level 30).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item serves exclusively as a "Key" to unlock a specific legendary encounter in the overworld. It has no utility in Trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve any Pokémon, it is the only legitimate way in the Generation III engine (specifically *Pokémon Emerald*) to encounter a Mew that obeys the player and can be transferred through subsequent generations (due to it not being a "fateful encounter" flag bypass, but a native map event).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed as a limited-time promotional event. Historically, the Old Sea Map was **only released in Japan** for *Pokémon Emerald* players during the 2005 Pokémon Festa and at PokéPark. Because it was never officially distributed in North America or Europe, the Faraway Island event remains inaccessible in those regions without the use of external save editing or glitching.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered to the player via a **Mystery Gift** at a Pokémon Center.
* **Historical Context:** In the Hoenn lore, the Old Sea Map is one of the "Grand Trio" of Generation III event tickets, alongside the Aurora Ticket (Birth Island/Deoxys) and the Mystic Ticket (Navel Rock/Ho-Oh and Lugia).
