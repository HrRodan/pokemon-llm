## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR7116** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It functions as a "raid trigger" rather than a standard held item or medicine.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Functionally **Not for sale**; distributed via serial codes or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), it summons a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the SGR7116 code is associated with summoning **Gigantamax Corviknight**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of initiating a raid. However, the Pokémon caught from this raid may possess Hidden Abilities and the Gigantamax factor, making it a source for competitive-grade team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon the activation of the raid. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz and cannot be held by a Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-only item**. It was historically acquired via serial codes provided through specific retail partnerships (such as CoroCoro in Japan or specific Western retailers) during the Generation VIII era. It is not available through standard gameplay or Pokémon Centers.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item cannot be found on wild Pokémon and is exclusively delivered via Mystery Gift as an external distribution.
