## Identity & Utility
**Pinsirite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to interact with a trainer's Mega Ring/Bracelet. When held by a Pinsir, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Held Item** that is **not for sale** in traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). As a Mega Stone, it is treated as a unique treasure rather than a commercial commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pinsir, the "Mega Evolve" option becomes available in the battle menu. Upon activation, Pinsir transforms into **Mega Pinsir**, gaining a significant boost to its Attack, Defense, and Speed stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Though typically protected from item-removing effects like Knock Off or Fling while held by Pinsir, the raw power value is 80).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VI–VII).** Mega Pinsir is a high-tier offensive threat. Its ability shifts to **Aerilate**, which converts Normal-type moves into Flying-type moves and boosts their power. This makes moves like *Quick Attack* (priority) and *Return/Frustration* devastatingly powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) options.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically coded for Pinsir. It does not affect any other Pokémon species. It bypasses standard evolution logic, as Mega Evolution is a temporary, mid-battle transformation that reverts once the battle ends or the Pokémon faints.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Generation VI:** In *Pokémon X*, it is found in the Santalune Forest during the post-game (only between 8:00 PM and 9:00 PM). It is notably absent in *Pokémon Y*, requiring a trade.
    * **Generation VII:** Obtainable via the Battle Tree in *Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon* for 64 Battle Points (BP).
    * **Current Status:** Mega Stones, including Pinsirite, are currently unavailable in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet) due to the removal of the Mega Evolution mechanic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item typically discovered through exploration or as a reward for high-level trainer feats.
