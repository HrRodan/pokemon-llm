## Identity & Utility
**Aloraichium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically attuned to the unique physiology of Alolan Raichu. It serves as a specialized held item that enables the use of a signature Z-Move. It is a **Held Item** (functionally a Key Item in the inventory) that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition; unique item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Alolan Raichu** that knows the move **Thunderbolt**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Stoked Sparksurfer**. 
    * **Stoked Sparksurfer Details:** This is an Electric-type physical or special attack (based on the original move) with a base power of **175**. Notably, it has a secondary effect that **guarantees paralysis** on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling, and they cannot be removed from the holder by moves like Knock Off, Thief, or Trick.
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically used in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017/2018 and Smogon) as a "nuke" option. It was frequently paired with **Electric Terrain** (often provided by Tapu Koko) to activate Alolan Raichu's *Surge Surfer* ability, doubling its speed and allowing it to fire off a high-damage, 100% paralysis-inducing move before the opponent could react.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for battle transformation of a move. It only functions for the **Alolan Form** of Raichu; standard Raichu cannot use this crystal.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained from an NPC in **Seafolk Village** on Poni Island. The player must show the NPC an Alolan Raichu to receive the crystal.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique gift item and cannot be farmed or duplicated via the Pickup ability. 
* **Lore context:** Unlike generic Z-Crystals (like Electrium Z), signature Z-Crystals represent a deeper bond or a specific evolutionary adaptation unique to a single species or form.
