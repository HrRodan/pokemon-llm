## Identity & Utility
**Root Fossil** is a **Dex-Completion / Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (though historically appearing first in the Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A fossilized remains of a prehistoric sea-dwelling Pokémon that resembles a plant’s root. It is a **special acquisition item** used to resurrect extinct species. While it cannot be used directly in battle, it is a key component for completing the Pokédex. 
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high sell price, its value lies in the unique Pokémon it produces.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to specific research facilities—such as the **Mining Museum in Oreburgh City**, the **Museum of Science in Pewter City**, or the **Devon Corporation in Rustboro City**—it can be regenerated into the Rock/Grass-type Pokémon **Lileep**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100. This is exceptionally high for a non-combat item, making it a powerful (though single-use) projectile if used with the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility. However, its resurrected form, **Cradily**, is used in competitive play as a specialized "Storm Drain" tank, capable of anchoring Sandstorm-based teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item serves as the "life trigger" for the Lileep line. It is traditionally the counterpart to the **Claw Fossil** (Anorith).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sinnoh:** Extracted as a rare treasure from the **Grand Underground**.
    * **Kanto/Johto:** Found via Rock Smash or special distribution in the Pewter Museum.
    * **Hoenn:** Found in the Desert Underpass or chosen at the Mirage Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically obtained through environmental interaction (mining/smashing rocks) or as a scripted event item. In the Sinnoh region, its appearance frequency in the Underground is often dependent on the Trainer ID's parity (version-dependent mechanics).
