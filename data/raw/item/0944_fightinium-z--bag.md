## Identity & Utility
**Fightinium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade Fighting-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Key Item / Special Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**. In the player's inventory, the "Bag" version represents the crystal stored for distribution to Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one **Fighting-type move**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the Z-Move **All-Out Pummeling**, provided the trainer has a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring. 
    * The base power and category (Physical or Special) of All-Out Pummeling depend on the original move used.
    * If the base move is a status move (e.g., Bulk Up), it becomes **Z-Bulk Up**, providing its usual benefits plus an additional Attack boost.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be consumed, lost, or Flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen 7).** In Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon formats, Fightinium Z was a premier offensive choice. It allowed Fighting-types like Buzzwole, Terrakion, or Kartana (via Sacred Sword) to bypass their usual checks with a massive one-time burst of damage. It was also frequently used on non-Fighting types (like Landorus-T with Superpower) to lure in and eliminate specific counters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It is immune to mechanics like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*; a Pokémon holding a Z-Crystal cannot have it removed or stolen.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained through the story in the Alola region. It is traditionally gifted to the player by **Hala**, the Kahuna of Melemele Island, after the player successfully completes the Grand Trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, singular item tied to the Trial system of Alola.
* **Lore context:** The crystal represents the bond between the trainer and Pokémon, manifesting the "Fighting Spirit" of Alola's protectors into a tangible physical force.
