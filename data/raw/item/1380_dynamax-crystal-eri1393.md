## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ERI1393** is a **Dynamax-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It functions as a "summoning" item for rare or version-exclusive encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; essentially **Not for sale** via standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to spawn a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (determined by the unique ID of the crystal). These crystals allow players to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used strictly for triggering Max Raid Battles to facilitate catching Pokémon or farming Raid rewards (TRs, Exp. Candies, and Berries).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a localized event-triggering mechanism for the Galar region's Dynamax mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals with "ERI" prefixes were primarily distributed as **Special Event Rewards** or **Pre-order Bonuses** (such as those bundled with the *Sword & Shield* Dual Pack or retail-specific promotions like those from GameStop or Dyna Crystal events). They are not found through normal gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via "Mystery Gift" as a serial code and resides in the "Other Items" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag until used at the Watchtower Lair.
