## Identity & Utility
**Timer Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized capture device designed for protracted encounters. Unlike standard balls, its efficacy is tied to the duration of the battle, becoming progressively more effective as the turn count increases. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at specialized shops and used exclusively in wild Pokémon encounters.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for specialty balls).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to catch a wild Pokémon with a variable catch rate multiplier.
    * **Scaling (Modern):** The catch rate starts at **1.1×** on the first turn and increases by **0.1×** every turn (with some generations applying a **0.3×** increase per turn).
    * **Maximum Threshold:** The multiplier caps at **4.0×** after 10 to 30 turns (depending on the specific game generation). At its peak, it is twice as effective as an Ultra Ball (2.0×).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used effectively with Fling; typically results in a failure or minimal damage in-game).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles or VGC/Smogon formats, as it does not provide stat boosts or passive recovery. It is strictly a utility tool for the "Catching" phase of the game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a favorite for **Nuzlocke** players and **Legendary hunters** who utilize "stall" tactics or moves like *False Swipe* to extend the battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized Pokémon Marts (e.g., Slateport City in Hoenn, Hammerlocke in Galar) or the Pokémon League. It is often unlocked after the player has reached a certain progression milestone (mid-to-late game).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered as "ground loot," received from NPCs, or purchased in bulk once players reach the endgame "Legendary hunting" phase.
* **Strategic Context:** It is the mechanical opposite of the **Quick Ball**. While the Quick Ball is optimized for Turn 1, the Timer Ball is the ultimate "fail-safe" for difficult-to-catch Pokémon with low catch rates (like Beldum or Box Legendaries) that survive into the late-game turns.
