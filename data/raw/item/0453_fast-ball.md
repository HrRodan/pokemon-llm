## Identity & Utility
**Fast Ball** is a specialized **Poké Ball (Apricorn Ball)** introduced in Generation II (Johto) and reintroduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** A specialized capture device designed for high-velocity targets. It is a **Consumable** item used during wild encounters. While it cannot be purchased with standard currency in most regions, it is a "Boutique Ball" highly valued for its rarity and specific aesthetic.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically crafted from Apricorns or obtained through special NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a wild encounter, it provides a **4× Catch Rate multiplier** if the target Pokémon has a **Base Speed stat of 100 or higher**. If the target's base speed is lower than 100, it functions as a standard Poké Ball (1× multiplier).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls cannot be Flung in standard battle mechanics to deal damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no combat utility, the Fast Ball is a **Competitive Staple for "Aesthetic Collectors."** Players often seek to catch high-speed threats (like Regieleki, Jolteon, or Dragapult) in Fast Balls to match the Pokémon's theme or to signal the rarity of the capture.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of the seven specialized balls crafted by the artisan **Kurt**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically crafted by providing a **White Apricorn** to Kurt in Azalea Town (Johto). In modern titles (Gen VII, VIII, IX), it is often a rare reward from the Item Printer, the Ball Guy, or as a completion reward for the Pokédex, making it significantly scarcer than standard shop-bought balls.
* **Historical Context (World Knowledge):** In the original Generation II games, the Fast Ball was famously bugged and only applied its multiplier to three specific Pokémon (Magnemite, Grimer, and Tangela) instead of fleeing/fast Pokémon. Since Generation IV (HeartGold/SoulSilver), the mechanic was corrected to the **Base Speed ≥ 100** check.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be manufactured or awarded to the trainer.
