## Identity & Utility
**TM84 (Poison Jab)** is a **Machine** (Technical Machine) introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A reusable (post-Gen V) or single-use (pre-Gen V/BDSP) data disc used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Poison Jab**. It targets the opponent with a venom-steeped appendage. It is a **Consumable/Machine** item that can be bought in various iterations of the series.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Poison Jab** to a compatible Pokémon. Poison Jab is a **Physical Poison-type move** with a Base Power of **80** and an Accuracy of **100%**.
* **Secondary Mechanics:**
    * **Status Condition:** The move taught by this TM has a **30% chance** to inflict the **Poison** status on the target, making it a reliable source of chip damage and pressure.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Competitive Staple** for physical attackers. Its primary utility in the meta (especially post-Gen VI) is **Fairy-type coverage**. Physical attackers such as Garchomp, Toxicroak, and Terrakion often carry Poison Jab to surprise and OHKO/2HKO Fairy-type threats like Clefable or Tapu Bulu.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, particularly those with claws, spikes, or stingers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM84 has appeared in every mainline game since Diamond & Pearl. It is frequently found in mid-to-late game areas (e.g., Route 212 in Sinnoh) or purchased from Department Stores and TM vendors. In *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials (specifically Toxiper and Sneasel materials).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. In the game world, it represents a piece of high-tech hardware used by trainers to bypass natural move-learning limitations.
