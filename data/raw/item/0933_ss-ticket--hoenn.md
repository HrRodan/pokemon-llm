## Identity & Utility
**S.S. Ticket (Hoenn)** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in this specific data iteration) originating from the Hoenn region, with this specific entry documented in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A required ticket for sailing on the S.S. Tidal ferry. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold. While its primary lore is rooted in the Hoenn region, this specific data entry appears in the Generation VII (Alola) index.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its native Hoenn context (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald/ORAS), this item grants the player access to the **S.S. Tidal**. This allows for high-speed travel between **Slateport City** and **Lilycove City**, and provides access to the **Battle Tower** or **Battle Frontier** in the post-game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-progression item and has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC or Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the NPC attendants at the Hoenn ferry terminals. In the context of Generation VII where this data is indexed, it is an **unused asset**, likely maintained for internal database consistency or potential cross-regional references.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally, this item is obtained as a gift from **Norman** (the protagonist's father) in Littleroot Town after the player has defeated the Elite Four and entered the Hall of Fame. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. As a Key Item, it is unique and cannot be farmed or duplicated via abilities like **Pickup** or moves like **Thief**.
* **Lore Context:** The S.S. Ticket represents the transition into the "Post-Game" of the Hoenn region, symbolizing the player's new status as Champion and their ability to explore the wider seas and the prestigious Battle Frontier.
