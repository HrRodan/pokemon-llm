## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal VIR4910** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive consumable item used in the Galar region's Wild Area. It is specifically designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone den located in the Watchtower Ruins). It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, its true value is as a limited distribution item, as it cannot be bought in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon using the item at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific **Max Raid Battle** that lasts until the end of the day. The encounter is typically a rare Pokémon or a Pokémon with its Hidden Ability or Gigantamax factor.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is used by players to encounter and catch high-IV, Hidden Ability, or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon which are essential for building competitive VGC or Smogon teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar Wild Area. Once the raid is initiated and defeated/caught, the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific variant (VIR4910) is typically distributed via **Serial Codes** or special retail promotions (such as those from GameStop, Best Buy, or regional retailers). It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is an "External" item provided to the player through Mystery Gift or special event distributions. In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals are highly concentrated clusters of Galar Particles that can force a Dynamax phenomenon to occur at a dormant Power Spot.
