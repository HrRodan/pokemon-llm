## Identity & Utility
**Meowth Candy** is a **Species-Specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** A specialized nutrient packed with energy tailored to the Meowth evolutionary line. Unlike standard vitamins that target a single stat, this candy provides a comprehensive boost to a Pokémon's overall potential. It is a **Consumable** item that can be sold for a nominal fee but is primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than direct purchase.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When administered to a member of the **Meowth** or **Persian** (including Alolan forms) species, it increases **all six stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed) simultaneously by **+1**. This system utilizes "Awakening Values" (AVs) rather than traditional Effort Values (EVs), allowing a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in every stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item does not exist in game engines where Fling is a usable mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System Specific.** It is a mandatory requirement for optimizing Pokémon in *Let's Go* "No Restrictions" competitive formats. However, it has no effect in traditional core-series VGC or Smogon tiers, as the AV system is exclusive to the Kanto-revisit mechanics of Generation VII.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly for stat enhancement and does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with **Meowth** and **Persian**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Meowth Candy is primarily obtained by catching wild Meowth to build a **Catch Combo** or by "transferring" caught Meowth to **Professor Oak** in exchange for rewards. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon as a held item. It is a reward for mechanical proficiency in the field (Catching/Research).
* **Context:** In the lore of the *Let's Go* series, candies represent the essence of a species' strength, gathered through research and field study to help a trainer's partners reach their maximum physical and mental potential without traditional level-grinding.
