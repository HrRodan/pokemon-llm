## Identity & Utility
**Whimsical-tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's picnic table. It is a **Reusable Cosmetic** item that can be purchased at specialized retail locations. Unlike medicines or held items, it serves no function in combat but enhances the aesthetic of the Picnic mechanic used for breeding and sandwich-making.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, they can select the Whimsical-tablecloth from their inventory to change the visual pattern of the table. This is purely a cosmetic change and does not affect the quality of sandwiches or the frequency of Pokémon Eggs found in the basket.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists exclusively for the overworld Picnic feature and has no impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the broader Paldean customization suite, similar to clothing or sandwich picks.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Picnic Knacks** stores located in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. It is available early in the game once the player has access to these cities.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or obtained as a reward through gameplay progression in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.
