## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (SER7141)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-specific consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Wild Area (West Lake Axewell). Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot** be bought through normal gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; this value is a placeholder as the item is distributed via serial codes and cannot be purchased at Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player stands before the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area and uses this item from the bag, it summons a specific Max Raid Battle (indicated by the `ser7141` serial designation). These raids typically feature rare Pokémon, version-exclusives, or Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (PvE Only).** While the item itself has no competitive utility, the Pokémon caught through these raids are often highly viable, frequently possessing **Hidden Abilities**, high **Individual Values (IVs)**, or the ability to Gigantamax.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It is consumed immediately upon the activation of the raid beam.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Special Distribution Only.** This specific crystal was distributed via **Serial Codes** provided through various retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Best Buy, or Target) or as a bonus for purchasing the *Sword & Shield* Dual Pack or Expansion Pass.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a digital "key" used to unlock specific encounters.
* **World Knowledge:** The `ser7141` crystal is part of a series of "Star" items (e.g., ★And15, ★And458) that allow players to encounter specific threats like Gigantamax Corviknight, Duraludon, or Larvitar/Jangmo-o early in the game regardless of version exclusivity.
