## Identity & Utility
**TR45 (Muddy Water)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Muddy Water** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard Technical Machines (TMs) in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use, making them a high-value resource.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it carries a high monetary value, it is primarily acquired via Watt Traders in the Wild Area for 3,000–5,000 Watts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Muddy Water**. This is a powerful Water-type Special move with 90 Base Power and 85% Accuracy. It has a 30% chance to lower the target's Accuracy by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). While rarely used for Fling, it provides significant damage if thrown.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Muddy Water is a premier choice for Water-type special attackers in **Double Battles (VGC)**. It serves as an alternative to Surf because it hits both opponents while leaving the user's ally unharmed. The 30% accuracy reduction chance can frequently swing the momentum of a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is single-use. Once the move is taught, the TR is destroyed. It is primarily compatible with Water-types (e.g., Swampert, Gastrodon, Tapu Fini) and select "mud-based" Pokémon like Stunfisk.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR45 is primarily obtained by defeating Water-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (stock rotates daily). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered through the **Cram-o-matic** (using specific recipes) or as a reward for high-level raid encounters.
* **World Context:** TRs represent a return to the classic "disposable" machine mechanic, often containing moves that were formerly TMs in previous generations or Move Tutor exclusives. TR45 specifically grants access to a move formerly exclusive to a small number of Pokémon like the Mudkip line.
