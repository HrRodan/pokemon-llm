## Identity & Utility
**Pawmi Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clump of fur dropped by members of the Pawmi evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold at Pokémon Centers or used at the TM Machine. Unlike traditional held items, it is a resource specifically designed for the generation of Technical Machines.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Standard crafting material value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific TMs at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. In *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, it is notably used to craft Electric-type moves such as **TM048 (Volt Switch)** and **TM147 (Wild Charge)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle economy and move-pool expansion via crafting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon from the Pawmi family. It can also be found as sparkling overworld pickups in areas where these Pokémon habitat.
* **Wild Drop Source:** Dropped by wild **Pawmi**, **Pawmo**, and **Pawmot**. Because it is a guaranteed drop upon victory or capture, it is easily farmed in the early-game areas of the Paldea region (such as South Province).
