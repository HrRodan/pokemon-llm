## Identity & Utility
**Comet Shard** is a **Loot/Valuable** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** A rare, glittering fragment of a celestial body that fell to Earth. It serves no functional purpose in battle or training and is categorized as "vendor trash." It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot be bought** from standard Poké Marts, only found or harvested.
* **Cost:** 25,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While its base internal price is high, its true utility lies in its resale value to specialized NPCs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Financial gain. In most games, it sells for a high price at any shop. Specifically, in its debut generation (Black/White), it can be sold to the **Ore Collector** in Icirrus City for a premium price of **60,000 Poké Dollars**, making it one of the most valuable single items in the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no stat boosts or passive recovery. Its only "utility" in a competitive sense is being a target for *Thief* or *Trick* to deprive the opponent of a useful held item, though this is purely accidental.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "Treasure" item meant to fund the purchase of expensive medicines, TMs, or vitamins.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a hidden item via the Dowsing Machine in crater-related locations (like the Giant Chasm) or gifted by NPCs. 
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a rare held item for celestial-themed Pokémon. It can be found on wild **Clefairy, Clefable, Cleffa, Lunatone,** and **Solrock** (1% to 5% chance). 
* **Farming Strategy:** Players often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase held item chances) and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to farm these from wild Lunatone or Solrock to accumulate wealth quickly.
