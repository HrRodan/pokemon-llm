## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (UMA4301)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap nominal value**; however, its true value is tied to its status as a limited-run promotional distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located at the Ruins of Watchtower in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—associated with the unique code UMA4301—to appear in a Max Raid Battle. This encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is purely an acquisition tool for the overworld and does not impact competitive VGC or Smogon formats directly. Its utility lies in providing access to specific Pokémon that may have Hidden Abilities or G-Max factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was not available via standard gameplay (Poké Marts or NPCs). It was typically distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail collaborations or pre-order bonuses (e.g., promotional flyers at stores like GameStop or Best Buy).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an "Event Distribution" asset.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are concentrated masses of Galar Particle energy. While standard Max Raid dens activate naturally, these crystals force a specific "Star" raid to manifest, regardless of the current den cycle.
