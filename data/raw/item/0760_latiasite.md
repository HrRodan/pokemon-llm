## Identity & Utility
**Latiasite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (though cataloged here under Generation VII metadata).
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystalline stone that reacts with a Trainer's Key Stone. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is non-consumable and cannot be sold at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through special story events or Battle Point exchanges).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Latias**, it enables **Mega Evolution** into Mega Latias during battle. This transformation significantly increases Latias’s Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense stats while retaining the **Levitate** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Note: Mega Stones cannot be successfully Flung, removed by *Knock Off*, or stolen by *Thief/Covet* if held by the correct Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Mega Latias is a premier bulky attacker in high-level play (Smogon OU/Uber and VGC). It is frequently used as a "Calm Mind" sweeper because its massive defensive boosts allow it to survive powerful hits while setting up. Its versatility as a support Pokémon (using *Roost* and *Defog*) makes it a high-tier threat in formats where Mega Evolution is permitted.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is species-specific. It has no effect when held by any Pokémon other than Latias (including Latios).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a **Key Event reward**. In the Hoenn remakes (*Alpha Sapphire*), it is gifted by Steven Stone. In Generation VII (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), it was originally a Mystery Gift distribution and later became available for purchase at the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a unique artifact tied to the lore of the Eon Duo and the bond between Trainer and Pokémon.
