## Identity & Utility
**Storage Key** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**, with subsequent iterations appearing in later regions like **Sinnoh (Generation IV)**.
* **Description:** A specialized key designed to unlock restricted areas. In the Hoenn region, it is described as an old, fragile-looking key used to open the storage hold of the **Abandoned Ship**. In Sinnoh, it serves as a security bypass for high-clearance facilities. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to specific locked environments required for story progression or obtaining rare items.
    * **Hoenn (Gen III):** Unlocks the Storage Room on the Abandoned Ship (Route 108), allowing the player to retrieve **TM13 (Ice Beam)**.
    * **Sinnoh (Gen IV):** Grants access to the **Team Galactic Warehouse** in Veilstone City, a critical step in dismantling the villainous team's operations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld progression and narrative advancement. It provides no tactical advantage in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon nor does it interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz. Its utility is strictly environmental.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Hoenn:** Found deep within the **Abandoned Ship** (requires the move **Dive** to access certain sections).
    * **Sinnoh:** Typically dropped by a **Team Galactic Grunt** outside the Galactic Warehouse in Veilstone City after the player defeats them.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind quest item that is added directly to the "Key Items" pocket of the Trainer's Bag.
