## Identity & Utility
**Pink Scarf** is a **Contest Scarf** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An accessory to be held by a Pokémon to enhance its performance during the judging phase of a Pokémon Contest. It is a **Held Item** that is technically purchasable but primarily acquired through specific NPC interactions.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the Pokémon's **Cuteness** condition by 10% of the maximum possible value during the Visual Competition (or Introduction Round) of a Pokémon Contest or Super Contest. This directly improves the number of hearts received from the audience/judges before moves are even performed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; provides no additional effect when thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in standard VGC or Smogon battle formats. It is a dedicated **Contest Meta** item used exclusively for the Pokémon Contest sub-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its effectiveness is maximized when the holding Pokémon has already consumed Pink Pokéblocks or Sweet Poffins to raise its base Cuteness stat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most core-series games (Hoenn and Sinnoh), the Pink Scarf cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts. It is traditionally gifted by the **Pokémon Fan Club Chairman** (in Slateport City or Hearthome City) after the player shows him a Pokémon with a maxed-out (or very high) Cuteness condition.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a specialty reward for dedicated Pokémon Coordinators rather than a common field item.
