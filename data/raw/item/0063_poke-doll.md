## Identity & Utility
**Poké Doll** is a **Consumable Escape Item** (categorized under "Spelunking") introduced in **Generation I** (metadata here reflects Generation IV standards).
* **Description:** A plush doll, typically shaped like a Clefairy, designed to distract wild Pokémon. It is a **consumable** item that can be used during a battle to guarantee a successful escape. It is **cheap and highly accessible** to trainers.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during a wild Pokémon encounter, it **guarantees flight**, regardless of the player's Speed stat or the presence of trapping moves/abilities (such as *Mean Look*, *Block*, *Arena Trap*, or *Shadow Tag*). It has no effect in Trainer battles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor physical damage; no secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is purely a utility tool for the overworld and wild encounters. It is a staple in **Speedruns** (to skip scripted encounters or save time) and **Nuzlocke challenges** (as a safety net to avoid losing a Pokémon to a high-level wild encounter or Wobbuffet).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It functions identically to the *Fluffy Tail* and *Poké Toy* found in other regions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Department Stores** (such as Celadon, Goldenrod, or Lilycove) and most standard Poké Marts after certain badge milestones. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased or found as floor loot in caves and dungeons.
* **Historical Context:** In the original Kanto adventures, the Poké Doll gained fame for a specific sequence-break: it could be used to appease the **Ghost of Marowak** in the Pokémon Tower, allowing trainers to bypass the need for the Silph Scope. This interaction was removed in later remakes to enforce the intended story progression.
