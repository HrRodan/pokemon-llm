## Identity & Utility
**Letter** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A formal correspondence addressed to Steven Stone from the President of the Devon Corporation. It is a **Key Item** that is fundamental to the game's narrative progression. As a Key Item, it **cannot be bought, sold, or held** by a Pokémon for battle use.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Letter serves as a delivery objective. Its delivery to Steven Stone in **Granite Cave** (near Dewford Town) is a mandatory milestone in the Hoenn region story. Upon delivery, the player is granted access to further plot events and rewards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the single-player campaign/story mode and has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Delivering this item is often a prerequisite for obtaining the **PokéNav** and the **Exp. Share** from Mr. Stone (Devon Corp President) as a gesture of gratitude for the delivery.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained directly from **Mr. Stone**, the President of the Devon Corporation in **Rustboro City**, after the player retrieves the stolen Devon Parts from Team Aqua/Magma in the Rusturf Tunnel.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind quest item that resides in the Key Items pocket of the Bag until its objective is completed.
