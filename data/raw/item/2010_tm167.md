## Identity & Utility
**TM167 (Close Combat)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A Move-teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the Fighting-type move **Close Combat**. In the Paldea region, TMs are single-use consumables that can be replicated using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard shops; requires crafting via League Points and Pokémon materials).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Close Combat**. Close Combat is a powerful physical Fighting-type attack with **120 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. Upon use, it lowers the user's Defense and Special Defense stats by one stage each.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Close Combat is one of the most vital moves in competitive singles (Smogon) and doubles (VGC). It provides immediate, high-damage output for physical attackers such as Lucario, Iron Valiant, Great Tusk, and Arcanine. The defensive drop is often mitigated by switching out or using the move as a finishing blow.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be crafted infinitely provided the player has the required resources.
