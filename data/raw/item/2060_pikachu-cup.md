## Identity & Utility
**Pikachu-cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a decorative component used to customize the player's picnic set. It serves a purely cosmetic purpose, changing the visual aesthetic of the picnic table to a theme featuring the mascot Pokémon, Pikachu. It is a **Consumable Overworld** item (specifically a Picnic accessory) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player sets up a Picnic in the Paldea region, the Pikachu Cup can be selected to change the appearance of the cups on the picnic table. It has no direct impact on Sandwich-making buffs (Meal Powers) or Pokémon stats; it is purely for visual customization.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an overworld cosmetic item with no application in VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. It is part of the "Picnic" sub-system of mechanics used for breeding (Egg discovery) and bonding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at **Picnic Knack** shops located in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia**. It is available early in the game once the player has access to these cities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike held items or berries, picnic accessories are exclusively obtained through specialized retail vendors or specific NPC gifts in the Paldea region.
