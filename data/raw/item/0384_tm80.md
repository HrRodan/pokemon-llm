## Identity & Utility
**TM80 (Rock Slide)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Rock Slide**, a physical Rock-type attack where large boulders are hurled at the target. It is a utility item that allows trainers to expand a Pokémon's movepool beyond its natural level-up set.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In many modern iterations, TMs are either multi-use or can be crafted/purchased affordably at Department Stores or TM Machines.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Rock Slide** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Statistics:** 75 Base Power, 90% Accuracy.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance to flinch** the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and therefore have no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **VGC/Doubles Staple.** Rock Slide is one of the most impactful moves in competitive doubles because it hits both opposing Pokémon simultaneously. When combined with high-speed users (like Garchomp or Aerodactyl) or the ability **Serene Grace**, the 30% flinch chance becomes a win condition by effectively "denying" the opponent's turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a massive variety of Pokémon, primarily Rock, Ground, Fighting, and Steel types, as well as many "heavy" or "beast-like" Pokémon from other types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM80 has maintained a consistent presence across every core series game from Generation IV through Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet). It is frequently found in mountainous or cavernous regions (e.g., Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh, Twist Mountain in Unova) or purchased at major Department Stores. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or Evolution Stones, it must be found as a field item, received from an NPC, or purchased. In the "Pickup" table, TMs are generally not included, making this a fixed-location or shop-based acquisition.
