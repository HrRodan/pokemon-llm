## Identity & Utility
**Origin Ball** (laorigin-ball) is a Specialty Poké Ball introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A unique, ornate Poké Ball crafted specifically from the remnants of the Red Chain. It is a **Story-Essential Key Item** that cannot be bought or sold. Unlike standard Poké Balls, it is designed for a singular, high-stakes purpose: the containment of a rampaging deity.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a guaranteed capture device (100% catch rate) specifically for **Origin Forme Dialga** or **Origin Forme Palkia** at the Temple of Sinnoh. It is used automatically during the scripted climax of the main story in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon in standard battle formats and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a plot-critical item restricted to the Hisui region's single-player campaign. It does not exist in the competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as the Pokémon caught in it are transferred to other games in standard Poké Balls or Cherish-style layouts depending on the Home transfer mechanics, though the "Origin Ball" visual remains in the Pokémon's summary.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Red Chain** lore and the "Almighty Sinnoh" narrative arc.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively via a story event in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*. After the Red Chain is shattered during the confrontation at the Temple of Sinnoh, the fragments are reforged by the Miss Fortune sisters (or provided via the Pearl/Diamond clan leaders) to create this singular ball.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a one-of-a-kind artifact within the game's narrative.
* **Lore Note:** Visually, the Origin Ball shares aesthetic similarities with the Cherish Ball (red coloration) but features the distinct, ancient Hisuian steam-vent design, symbolizing its origin in the ancient past of the Sinnoh region.
