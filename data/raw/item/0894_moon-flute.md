## Identity & Utility
**Moon Flute** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A ceremonial instrument used to produce tones that express gratitude to the legendary "Beast That Calls the Moon." As a Key Item, it cannot be sold, traded, or discarded. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind object essential for the Alolan pilgrimage.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When played in unison with the Sun Flute at the Altar of the Moone (or Altar of the Sunne), it summons the Legendary Pokémon and triggers the evolution of **Cosmog (Nebby)** into its final form. Specifically, in the context of the Altar of the Moone, it facilitates the evolution into **Lunala**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for plot progression and is categorized under "Medicine/Items" only in specific menu contexts, but it provides no tactical advantage in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the specific "trigger" for the climax of the Generation VII narrative. While it does not function like a standard Evolution Stone, it is the mechanical requirement for **Nebby** to reach its Legendary state within the Altar's scripted event.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained at **Exeggutor Island** in the Alola region. In *Pokémon Moon* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*, the player is tasked with retrieving this flute to reach the Altar. In the sister versions (*Sun/Ultra Sun*), the protagonist typically retrieves the Sun Flute while their companion, Lillie, possesses the Moon Flute.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore:** The flute is steeped in Alolan mythology, representing the connection between the people of the islands and the Ultra Beasts/Legendary Pokémon that protect them. Its music is the only way to focus the energy required to open an Ultra Wormhole at the Altar.
