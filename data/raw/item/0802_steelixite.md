## Identity & Utility
**Steelixite** is a **Mega Stone** (Competitive Held Item) introduced in **Generation VI** (though cataloged in this record under Generation VII).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed specifically for the Steelix evolutionary line. When held by a Steelix, it triggers Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; typically obtained through events, hidden locations, or Battle Point exchanges).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Steelix, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transformation significantly boosts Steelix's Attack, Defense, and Special Defense stats, and changes its ability to **Sand Force**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but results in the permanent loss of Mega Evolution capability for the remainder of the match).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Powerhouse.** Mega Steelix is utilized primarily as a premier physical wall and hazard setter. With a base Defense of 230, it is one of the sturdiest Pokémon in existence. It shines in **Sandstorm teams** due to its Sand Force ability, which boosts the power of its Steel, Ground, and Rock-type moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the exclusive trigger for Mega Steelix. It does not affect any other Pokémon and cannot be removed by moves like *Trick* or *Thief* if the holder is Steelix.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Steelixite is rarely found in standard Poké Marts. In the Alola region (Gen VII), it was historically made available through the **Battle Tree** as a prize or via specific mystery gift distributions. In its debut (ORAS), it was found within Granite Cave after the Groudon/Kyogre encounter.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a unique artifact of which only one is typically needed by a trainer to empower their Steelix.
