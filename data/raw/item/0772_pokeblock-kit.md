## Identity & Utility
**Pokéblock Kit** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, though metadata lists it within Generation VII datasets).
* **Description:** An all-in-one utility set that combines the functions of a Berry Blender and a Pokéblock Case. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It is designed specifically for players participating in the Pokémon Contest Spectacular circuit.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows the player to create Pokéblocks by blending Berries and provides a storage solution for the resulting treats. These Pokéblocks are fed to Pokémon to increase their **Contest Conditions**: Coolness, Beauty, Cuteness, Smartness, and Toughness.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on VGC or Smogon competitive formats, as Contest conditions do not affect base stats or battle performance (with the exception of Feebas's evolution).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is essential for evolving **Feebas into Milotic** in games where the Beauty condition is the primary trigger. By using the kit to produce high-quality Blue Pokéblocks, the player can maximize a Feebas's Beauty stat, causing it to evolve upon its next level-up.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, the kit is obtained as a gift from the Contest Star **Lisia** upon arriving in Slateport City. It streamlines the mechanics from original Generation III games by removing the need for standalone blending machines found in Contest Halls.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique story-progression item tied to the Hoenn region's cultural tradition of Pokémon Contests.
