## Identity & Utility
**Sharpedonite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in Generation VI (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*), with the provided data reflecting its presence in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized held item that resonates with a Sharpedo’s latent power. When held by a Sharpedo, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** during battle, provided the Trainer has a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Held Evolution Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Like most Mega Stones, it is treated as a unique or high-value artifact rather than a commercial commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the transformation of **Sharpedo** into **Mega Sharpedo** once per battle. This transformation increases Sharpedo's base stats (notably Attack, Defense, and Speed) and changes its ability to **Strong Jaw**, which increases the power of biting moves by 50%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. While it has a respectable Fling power, doing so is generally counterproductive as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the match.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple** for Sharpedo users. In Smogon and VGC (where Mega Evolution is permitted), Mega Sharpedo functions as a premier late-game cleaner. A common strategy involves using Sharpedo’s base ability, **Speed Boost**, for one turn before Mega Evolving to retain the speed advantage while gaining the **Strong Jaw** damage buff.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Sharpedo. It does not affect other Pokémon and cannot be removed or stolen via moves like *Thief* or *Trick* if the holder is a Sharpedo capable of Mega Evolving.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (*ORAS*), it is obtained from Archie in Alpha Sapphire or at the Battle Resort in Omega Ruby. In Generation VII (the source of this data), it is typically acquired as a reward for reaching a certain streak at the **Battle Tree** or via special distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It must be obtained through specific story events, NPC gifts, or competitive point exchanges (BP). Unlike items like Black Glasses, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
