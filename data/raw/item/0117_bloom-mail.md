## Identity & Utility
**Bloom-Mail** is an **All-Mail** social item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring pretty floral patterns used for sending short, pre-composed messages to other players during Pokémon trades. It is a **Consumable Social Item** that can be bought at most Poké Marts. Once a message is read, it can be erased to make the item reusable or stored in the Trainer's PC for posterity.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a predetermined list of words and phrases. The item must be held by a Pokémon to be "sent" during a trade. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While primarily a social tool, Mail items have a niche mechanical property: **Item Protection**. A Pokémon holding Mail cannot have its item removed by moves like *Thief*, *Covet*, or *Knock Off*, and it cannot be swapped via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*. Additionally, a Pokémon holding Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system, serving as a "lock" on that Pokémon until the Mail is removed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is ignored by most combat-oriented abilities, though it prevents the use of certain item-manipulation strategies.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Sinnoh, Johto (HGSS), and Unova regions. It is typically found in the specialty stationery section of larger department stores (e.g., Veilstone Department Store).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or received from NPCs.
* **Lore Context:** Bloom-Mail is part of a suite of Generation IV stationery (including Tunnel, Bloom, and Bubble Mail) designed to add personality to the Global Trade Station (GTS) and local wireless interactions. Its floral aesthetic makes it a thematic favorite for Grass-type specialists or during the spring season in Unova.
