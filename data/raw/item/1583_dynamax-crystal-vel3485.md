## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal VEL3485** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, single-use event item specifically designed for use in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It functions as a consumable "key" to unlock an encounter that is otherwise unavailable through standard Den resets.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inaccessible/Special Acquisition**). While a nominal cost exists in the data, this item cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts and is distributed via serial codes or special promotions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating the crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area) causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear. In the case of the **VEL3485** variant, it is specifically programmed to trigger an encounter with **Gigantamax Duraludon**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is a field-use consumable).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Prerequisite.** While the item itself has no competitive utility, it was historically significant for players to obtain a Pokémon with the Gigantamax Factor and specific IVs/Abilities for use in VGC (Video Game Championships) or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Watchtower Lair** environment, bypassing the standard Wishing Piece mechanics to force a specific, high-reward encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via unique **Serial Codes** provided through retail partnerships (such as GameStop or GAME) or magazines (such as CoroCoro). It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended for event-based distribution, often used by The Pokémon Company to drive engagement with retail partners or promotional media.
