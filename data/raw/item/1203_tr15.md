## Identity & Utility
**TR15 (Fire Blast)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device. It teaches the move **Fire Blast**, an incredibly powerful Fire-type attack that may leave the target with a burn. Unlike standard TMs in its debut generation, a TR is consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) in its native region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Fire Blast** to a compatible Pokémon. Fire Blast is a high-tier Special Fire move with a base power of 110 and an accuracy of 85%. It carries a 10% chance to inflict the Burn status condition.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 110 (Extremely High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR, making it an inefficient strategy compared to teaching the move.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier/Staple.** Fire Blast is a premier coverage move for Special Attackers (such as Hydreigon, Gengar, or Togekiss) who require more raw power than Flamethrower offers, despite the lower accuracy. It is a defining move in both VGC and Smogon formats for breaking through Steel and Grass-type walls.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR15 is most commonly obtained by defeating Fire-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a varying price in Watts (typically around 5,000–8,000 W).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is manufactured technology specifically for training. It is often farmed by players through repeated Raid dens to optimize competitive rosters.
