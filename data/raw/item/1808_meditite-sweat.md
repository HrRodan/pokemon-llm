## Identity & Utility
**Meditite Sweat** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
*   **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Meditite evolutionary line. It is primarily categorized as a consumable material used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers in the Paldea region.
*   **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap). While it has a small sell value, its primary economic value lies in being exchanged for League Points (LP) or used as a reagent for crafting TMs.

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** The item serves no direct function in battle or the overworld. Its sole purpose is to act as a required component for crafting specific Technical Machines. 
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a crafting reagent only. However, it is vital for competitive preparation as it is required to craft TMs that teach high-value competitive moves.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a drop-based resource used in the TM crafting system. Based on its origin, it is typically required for TMs associated with Psychic or Fighting-type moves (such as **TM054 Psyshock** or **TM120 Psychic**).

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** This item is not traditionally bought at Poké Marts. It is acquired as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon from the Meditite family.
*   **Wild Held Item:** It is a guaranteed drop from wild **Meditite** and **Medicham** in the Paldea region. Unlike traditional held items, it is placed directly into the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of a battle rather than being snatched or harvested via the Pickup ability.
