## Identity & Utility
**TM105 (X-Scissor)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** categorized under **All-Machines**, specifically associated with the **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)** move-teaching system.
* **Description:** TM105 is a data-disc used to teach the move **X-Scissor** to compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX context, TMs are consumable (single-use) items that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through overworld exploration or the crafting system rather than traditional retail.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **X-Scissor** to a Pokémon. 
    * **Move Type:** Bug
    * **Category:** Physical
    * **Power:** 80
    * **Accuracy:** 100%
    * **Effect:** The user slashes at the target by crossing its scythes or claws as if they were a pair of scissors. This is a reliable, high-accuracy STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for Bug-type physical attackers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines are typically ineligible for Fling mechanics in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Reliable STAB.** While often outclassed by **U-turn** (for momentum) or **First Impression** (for priority), X-Scissor is a staple for physical Bug attackers like **Scizor**, **Kleavor**, and **Lokix** who require consistent damage without the drawback of switching out or accuracy checks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used to expand the movepools of Physical sweepers and "slashing" themed Pokémon.
