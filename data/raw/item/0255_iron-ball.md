## Identity & Utility
**Iron Ball** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An item designed to weigh down the holder, significantly reducing its mobility. It is a **Held Item** that is **holdable-active**, meaning its effects are applied continuously during battle. While it can be bought, it is often found in rugged environments or via special exploration.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Pricing**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon's **Speed is reduced by 50%**. Additionally, it negates the Ground-type immunity typically granted to **Flying-types** or Pokémon with the **Levitate** ability. This makes the holder susceptible to Ground-type moves (taking neutral damage), as well as entry hazards like **Spikes** and **Toxic Spikes**, and the **Arena Trap** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** **130** (This is the highest base power possible for the move Fling, dealing massive Dark-type damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-utility "technical" item. It is frequently used in **Trick Room** archetypes to ensure a Pokémon moves first by reaching the lowest possible Speed tier. It is also a devastating item to "gift" to an opponent using the moves **Trick** or **Switcheroo**, effectively crippling fast sweepers or defensive Flying-types (like Corviknight or Skarmory). 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly buffs the power of the move **Gyro Ball** by lowering the user's relative Speed. It is also listed as an **Underground** item, signifying its presence in mining-based minigames (Sinnoh Grand Underground).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized battle shops (like the Battle Frontier or BP shops) or found in deep cavernous regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found held by wild **Mawile** (5% chance). Players can farm this item using the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief** and **Covet**.
