## Identity & Utility
**Float Stone** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that significantly lightens its body. It is a **Held Item** that is non-consumable upon use in battle and can be purchased for a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon’s body weight is halved (**0.5× weight**). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **highly niche** item. Its primary utility is to reduce damage taken from weight-based moves such as **Grass Knot** and **Low Kick**. However, it carries a significant drawback: because it makes the holder lighter, it actually **increases** the damage taken from moves like **Heavy Slam** and **Heat Crash**, which deal more damage if the attacker is much heavier than the defender.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. Its effect is purely mathematical, affecting moves that factor the "Weight" stat into their damage formulas. It is occasionally used on Pokémon with extremely high base weights (like Aggron or Mudsdale) to avoid max-power Grass Knots, though defensive items like Shuca Berries or Leftovers are generally preferred.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in mountainous or cave regions (such as Twist Mountain in Unova). In games where it is available for purchase, it usually appears in late-game specialty Marts or the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree for BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not commonly found** on wild Pokémon according to current data. It is primarily obtained as a fixed-location item ball or through specific NPC trades.
* **Context:** In the Pokémon world, the stone is described as being unnaturally light, almost defying gravity, which allows even the heaviest Pokémon to move with less impact on the ground.
