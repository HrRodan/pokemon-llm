## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ORI2061** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, the encounter remains active until the end of the day. It functions as a consumable "key" for localized boss encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap, though typically not obtainable through standard Marts; the price is a placeholder for game logic).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone structure in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a pillar of light is emitted, initiating a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (determined by the internal ID `ORI2061`). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for PvE (Player vs. Environment) content to obtain rare Pokémon, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax forms that may otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon, but provides access to high-IV or rare Pokémon that can then be trained for competitive play. It bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces at the specific Watchtower Lair location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily distributed via **special promotional serial codes** (often through retailers like GameStop, Micromania, or as pre-order bonuses). It is not available through regular gameplay or shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item intended for event-based engagement.
* **Context:** The "ORI" in the name typically refers to "Original" or "Origin" event distributions. These crystals allowed players to encounter Pokémon like Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Copperajah in dens regardless of their game version's usual restrictions.
