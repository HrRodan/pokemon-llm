## Identity & Utility
**Exp-Charm** is a **Key Item** (categorized as Gameplay) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Isle of Armor).
* **Description:** A mysterious charm containing a machine-like object that permanently amplifies the growth of a trainer's team. It is a **Key Item** that is **Not for sale**; once acquired, its effects are permanent and passive.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While in the player's Bag, the Exp-Charm increases the amount of Experience Points (EXP) earned by Pokémon in the party by **1.5x**. This effect stacks with other experience modifiers, such as the Lucky Egg or the boosted trade experience.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This is a **progression and training tool** designed to accelerate the leveling process for post-game content, competitive team building, and Pokédex completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution directly, but significantly shortens the time required for Pokémon to reach level-based evolution thresholds. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it remains in the Key Items pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found in the **Isle of Armor** expansion. It is given to the player by Hyde (Honey and Mustard's son) in the **Master Dojo** after the player begins their apprenticeship.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological artifact within the Galar region's lore, suggesting a blend of traditional "charms" and modern Galar technology.
