## Identity & Utility
**TM37** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its modern form in **Generation II** (teaching Sandstorm), though the item ID and data here associate its legacy with Generation III.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In all iterations from Generation II onwards, this TM teaches **Sandstorm**. Historically, in Generation I, TM37 taught **Egg Bomb**. It is a **consumable** or **reusable** teaching tool (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that is generally available for purchase or found in arid environments.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sandstorm** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Mechanics:** Summons a sandstorm for five turns. This weather condition deals 1/16th of max HP damage at the end of each turn to all Pokémon that are not **Rock, Ground, or Steel** types. 
    * **Stat Modification:** While a Sandstorm is active, the **Special Defense** of all Rock-type Pokémon is increased by 50% (1.5x).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs typically cannot be used with Fling in a meaningful way, or have a default low power of 10).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** While Sandstorm is a cornerstone of "Sand Teams," the move itself is rarely used in competitive VGC or Smogon singles because players prefer the ability **Sand Stream** (found on Tyranitar, Hippowdon, or Gigalith) to set the weather automatically upon entry. TM37 is used primarily on teams that require manual weather control to overwrite an opponent's Rain or Sun.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is highly compatible with most Rock, Ground, and Steel-type Pokémon, as well as several "desert-themed" species like Cacnea or Sigilyph.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Frequently found in **Desert Regions** (e.g., Route 111 in Hoenn, Route 228 in Sinnoh, or Haina Desert in Alola). In many games, it can be purchased at major Department Stores or TM shops for a modest price.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. In games with the **Pickup** ability, TMs are rarely in the loot pool, making this an item usually acquired through exploration or Mart purchases.
* **Legacy Note:** In Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow), this TM taught **Egg Bomb**, a signature-style move for Chansey and Exeggutor, highlighting a total shift in the item's identity between the Game Boy and Game Boy Color eras.
