## Identity & Utility
**TM39** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Rock Tomb**. It is a **Consumable/Machine** item that can be bought or crafted depending on the region.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Rock Tomb**. Rock Tomb is a Physical Rock-type move that deals damage and has a **100% chance to lower the target's Speed stat** by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has lower accuracy (95%) and power (60) compared to Rock Slide, it is a **Competitive Niche** staple for **Speed Control**. It is frequently used in VGC and lower-tier Smogon formats to punish fast switch-ins or to support slower teammates by guaranteed speed reduction.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Historically, in Generations I and II, TM39 contained the move **Swift**. Since the Hoenn region (Gen III), it has been permanently associated with Rock Tomb.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM39 is most famously associated with **Roxanne**, the Rustboro City Gym Leader in the Hoenn region, who rewards it to trainers upon their first badge. In modern titles like *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Rockruff Rock and Silicobra Sand.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is typically found as overworld loot, purchased at Department Stores, or received as a reward for defeating Gym Leaders specializing in the Rock type.
