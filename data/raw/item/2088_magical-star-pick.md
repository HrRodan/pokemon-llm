## Identity & Utility
**Magical Star Pick** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative pick used to hold ingredients together during the sandwich-making mini-game at Pokémon Picnics. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased at specialty culinary shops.
* **Cost:** 600 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** During the sandwich-making process, the pick is the final component added to secure the ingredients. While its primary function is to complete the sandwich, the choice of pick is largely cosmetic and does not influence the specific Meal Powers (like Sparkling Power or Encounter Power) granted by the sandwich ingredients themselves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as it is strictly used within the overworld Picnic mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Picnic" item sub-class, which is essential for breeding (obtaining Eggs) and temporary stat/shiny hunting boosts in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** branches and **Every Wich Way** restaurants throughout the Paldea region (e.g., Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured culinary tool used by trainers to facilitate the bonding and meal-making mechanics introduced in the ninth generation. Unlike Berries or standard held items, it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
