## Identity & Utility
**Super Lure** is a **Spelunking/Exploration** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A consumable glass bottle of perfume used in the overworld. It is the mid-tier iteration of the Lure family, sitting between the standard Lure and the Max Lure. It is a consumable item that can be purchased at most Poké Marts once the player has progressed sufficiently through the game.
* **Cost:** 700 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Mid-tier accessibility).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used, it increases the spawn rate of rare Pokémon in the wild and slightly increases the levels of wild Pokémon encountered. In the *Let's Go* series mechanics, it also increases the likelihood of encountering Shiny Pokémon and is a vital tool for maintaining Catch Combos. This specific "Super" variant lasts for **200 steps**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in competitive VGC or Smogon formats as its effects are strictly limited to overworld exploration and wild encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily used by players focused on "Shiny Hunting" or "IV Grinding" via the Catch Combo mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** and the **Cinnabar Island Mansion** after the player has earned a specific number of Gym Badges (typically 3-4 badges). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike Repels, which keep Pokémon away, Lures represent a specialized "perfume" mechanic unique to the Kanto region reimagining, serving as the mechanical opposite to a Cleanse Tag or Repel.
* **Context:** While identified in the data as "Generation VII," it is exclusive to the *Let's Go* engine and does not appear in *Pokémon Sun/Moon* or *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*.
