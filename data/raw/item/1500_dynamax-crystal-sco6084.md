## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6084** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A special event-based consumable item designed for use in the Galar region's Wild Area. When brought to the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive Raid Den at the Ruined Watchtower), it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Jangmo-o**. It is a **Consumable** event item that **cannot** be purchased through standard in-game Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; effectively **Not for Sale** and intended as a promotional distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, the crystal disappears and causes a red beam to trigger. This allows the player to challenge a **Max Raid Battle** featuring Jangmo-o. The raid persists until the end of the day it was activated or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None** in direct combat. However, it is highly valuable for competitive preparation as Max Raid Battles are a primary source for obtaining Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities** (Overcoat for the Jangmo-o line) and high **Individual Values (IVs)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Using this crystal allows players to encounter Jangmo-o regardless of version exclusivity (Jangmo-o is traditionally exclusive to *Pokémon Sword*). It does not trigger evolution but provides the base form for the pseudo-legendary Kommo-o.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily distributed via **serial codes** as a pre-order bonus or through specific retail promotions (such as the Dual Pack purchase for *Sword & Shield*). It is not found through natural gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special" item tied to the Dynamax mechanic and the Watchtower Lair sub-location.
* **Context:** The "SCO" in the name is a reference to the internal coding for the Jangmo-o encounter. These crystals were used by developers to provide "on-demand" raids for players during the early launch window of the Galar region games.
