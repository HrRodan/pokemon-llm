## Identity & Utility
**Normal Gem** is a **Jewel** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Described as a gem with an "ordinary essence," it is a single-use **Consumable Held Item**. It is designed to be consumed mid-battle to provide a one-time tactical burst of power to a Normal-type move.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Relatively Expensive; reflects its status as a specialized combat enhancer rather than a standard medicine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Normal-type move, the move's power is increased by **1.5×** (in its debut Generation V context) and the item is consumed immediately. *Note: In Generation VI and later, this multiplier was adjusted to 1.3×.*
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; Flinging the item consumes it without triggering the power boost).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact **Niche Staple**. It is famously utilized to maximize the damage of "priority" or "utility" moves. Common strategies include pairing it with **Fake Out** for a powerful lead-off flinch or with **Explosion/Self-Destruct** for a catastrophic final attack. 
    * **Synergies:** It is a premier choice for Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (such as Drifblim or Hawlucha), as using a Normal-type move triggers the Gem’s consumption, instantly doubling the user's Speed. It also stacks multiplicatively with the **Technician** ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of the few "Gems" that remained accessible in the game's code and competitive formats after most other elemental gems (like the Fire or Water Gem) were made unavailable in later generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its origin region (Unova), it is primarily found within **Dust Clouds** in caves. In later titles, it is typically available via Battle Frontier/Battle Maison/Battle Tree shops for Battle Points (BP) or found in specific wild area locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly held by wild Pokémon (0 total in the provided record). It is traditionally gathered via environmental interactions (like the aforementioned Dust Clouds) or as a reward for high-level trainer challenges.
