## Identity & Utility
**TM49 (Technical Machine 49)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A data-disc used to instantly teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. As a "Machine" item, its utility is defined by the specific move it contains, which has shifted significantly across the history of the franchise. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the game version) that is generally available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. The move contained within TM49 has evolved through the generations:
    * **Generations III – IV:** Teaches **Snatch** (a Dark-type move that "steals" the effects of an opponent's healing or stat-boosting move).
    * **Generations V – VII:** Teaches **Echoed Voice** (a Normal-type move that increases in power if used by any Pokémon on the field every turn).
    * **Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!:** Teaches **Superpower** (a high-damage Fighting-type move that lowers the user's Attack and Defense).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with Fling in most generations, or have a base power of 10).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Snatch (Gen 3-4):** A high-skill "anti-setup" niche move used in doubles to punish Tailwind or Calm Mind users.
        * **Echoed Voice (Gen 5-7):** Generally considered **niche**; used occasionally in "round" or "echo" themed gimmick teams.
        * **Superpower (LGPE):** A **Competitive Staple** for physical attackers needing high-priority Fighting-type coverage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in older generations (I-IV) but became infinite-use in Generation V through Generation VII.
