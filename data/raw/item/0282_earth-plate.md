## Identity & Utility
**Earth Plate** is a **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with esoteric text. It is a **Held Item** that serves a dual purpose: it acts as a type-specific power booster and a core mechanic for the Mythical Pokémon Arceus. It is technically valued at **1,000 Poké Dollars**, though it is rarely available through standard retail channels and is typically found through exploration.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, but functionally a unique artifact).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held, the Earth Plate increases the power of the holder's **Ground-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). When used with the move Fling, it deals significant physical damage but the item is lost for the duration of the battle.
    * **Multitype Interaction:** This is a cornerstone item for **Arceus**. If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability, the holder’s primary type changes to **Ground**. Consequently, the move **Judgment** also becomes Ground-type.
    * **Competitive Use:** While the 20% boost is matched by the *Soft Sand*, the Earth Plate is the mandatory held item for **Arceus-Ground**, a top-tier threat in the Ubers tier due to its excellent offensive coverage and defensive utility against Electric types. For non-Arceus Pokémon, it is a niche alternative to Life Orb or Choice items for players wanting to boost Ground STAB without recoil or move-locking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is an "Active Holdable" item, meaning its effect is constant and does not require a specific trigger to activate during combat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically tied to the **Sinnoh Underground** and **Grand Underground**, where it can be unearthed as a rare treasure. In other regions, it is usually found in remote locations associated with ancient ruins or myths (e.g., Oreburgh Gate or Desert Resort).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It is typically a fixed-location item or obtained via the **Underground** mining minigame.
* **Lore context:** Part of a series of plates said to be fragments of the primordial power used by Arceus to shape the universe. The Earth Plate specifically represents the element of land and soil.
