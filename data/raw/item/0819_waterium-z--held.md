## Identity & Utility
**Waterium Z (Held)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized form of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon, it acts as a catalyst to upgrade standard Water-type moves into high-damage Z-Moves. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold** in shops.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; Key Item variant).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder knows a Water-type damaging move, it can consume the trainer's Z-Power once per battle to unleash the Z-Move **Hydro Vortex**. If the holder knows a Water-type status move (like *Rain Dance*), it grants a **Z-Power effect** (e.g., Z-Rain Dance boosts Speed by one stage) in addition to the move's normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are **un-flingable** and cannot be lost in battle.
    * **Item Protection:** This item cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief* or *Magician*, or swapped via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017/2018 and SM OU). It is primarily used as a "wall-breaker" to allow Water-types like Palkia, Primarina, or Araquanid to bypass defensive checks with a one-time massive burst of damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon, but it is required for any Pokémon (excluding specific species with unique Z-Crystals) to access Water-type Z-Move mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in Marts. In the Alola region, it is obtained as a reward for completing the **Trial of Lana** at Brooklet Hill.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact tied to the Alolan Island Challenge tradition.
* **Lore:** Representing the power of the ocean, the Waterium Z is one of the elemental crystals used by Trainers to perform the "Pose of the Tides," synchronizing the Trainer's will with the Pokémon's energy.
