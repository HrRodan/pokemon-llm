## Identity & Utility
**TM45** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** that has been a mainstay in the series since Generation I.
* **Description:** This item is used to permanently teach a Pokémon a specific move. In its most recognized form (from Generation II onwards), it teaches the move **Attract**. It is a **Consumable** item (in most generations) that can be used to expand a Pokémon's tactical repertoire.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Attract** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Logic:** The move targets a Pokémon of the opposite gender, causing them to become "Infatuated." While infatuated, the target has a 50% chance of being unable to attack the user.
    * **Legacy Note:** In Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow), TM45 taught **Thunder Wave**, one of the most powerful status-inflicting moves in the game. From Generation II to Generation VIII, it transitioned to Attract.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or provide minimal power if allowed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** While Attract can be devastating in a "Para-Fusion-Attract" strategy (stacking status effects to prevent the opponent from moving), it is generally considered unreliable in high-level competitive play (VGC/Smogon) because it fails against genderless Pokémon (like Gholdengo or most Legendaries) and can be easily bypassed by switching out.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a vast majority of Pokémon that possess a gender.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Frequently available for purchase at major **Department Stores** (such as the Goldenrod City or Lilycove City Marts) or given as a reward by NPCs (notably Whitney in Johto after her defeat). In modern titles like *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon Materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM45 is never found held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an artificial tool developed by Silph Co. or similar organizations to facilitate move learning.
* **Historical Context:** Its shift from teaching Thunder Wave (a competitive staple) to Attract (a situational status move) represents one of the most significant shifts in TM numbering history.
