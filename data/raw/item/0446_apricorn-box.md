## Identity & Utility
**Apricorn Box** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** A specialized container designed for the collection and storage of Apricorns. In the Johto region, these fruits serve as the raw material for handcrafted Poké Balls. As a Key Item, it is permanent and cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a specific inventory expansion for Apricorns. It allows the player to store up to **99 of each of the seven varieties** of Apricorns (Red, Blue, Yellow, Green, White, Black, and Pink) without cluttering the main Bag.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a utility item for the overworld and collection mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The contents of the Apricorn Box are brought to **Kurt in Azalea Town**, who processes them into specialized "Apricorn Balls" (such as the Heavy Ball, Lure Ball, or Love Ball) over a 24-hour period.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is central to the Johto experience. It is obtained early in the game on **Route 30** from a resident in a house, enabling the player to begin harvesting Apricorn trees found throughout the region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool granted to the player to facilitate the traditional Johto method of Poké Ball crafting, a lore-heavy alternative to the mass-produced Poké Balls sold by Silph Co. or Devon Corp.
