## Identity & Utility
**Gold Bottle Cap** (referenced as `gold-bottle`) is a **Specialized Training Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A rare and gleaming bottle cap that serves as the ultimate currency for Hyper Training. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally not available for standard purchase, though it carries a high internal valuation.
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts, this value often reflects its high-stakes auction price or its significant resale value.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When traded to a specialized NPC (such as Mr. Hyper or the Hyper Trainer), it instantly increases all **six** of a Pokémon's Individual Values (IVs) to their maximum potential (31). This process is known as **Hyper Training**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used effectively with Fling; typically fails or has negligible power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** This is a cornerstone of competitive play, allowing trainers to turn Pokémon with sub-optimal stats—particularly Legendaries or Shiny Pokémon that cannot be easily bred—into "Perfect" specimens for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for stat optimization for Pokémon that have reached the required level threshold (Level 100 in Gen 7-8; Level 50 in Gen 9).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Extremely rare. Historically acquired through high-level rewards in the Battle Tree or Battle Tower, as a rare drop from 6-star and 7-star Tera Raid Battles, or via the **Porto Marinada Auction** in the Paldea region. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically a reward for elite-tier trainers or found as a hidden "treasure" in endgame locations. 
* **Context:** Unlike the standard Silver Bottle Cap which only raises one stat, the Gold Bottle Cap is the "Master Ball" of training items, ensuring a Pokémon's full potential is realized in a single transaction.
