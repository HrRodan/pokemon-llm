## Identity & Utility
**TM195 (Burning Jealousy)** is a **Technical Machine** (All-Machines category) introduced in **Generation IX** during the *The Teal Mask* expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc that teaches the move **Burning Jealousy** to compatible Pokémon. As a Gen IX TM, it is a consumable item that can be reproduced using the TM Machine system.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafting rather than direct purchase from a standard Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Burning Jealousy**. This is a Fire-type Special move with 70 Power and 100% Accuracy. Its unique secondary effect is that it **guarantees a burn** on any opponent that has had its stats increased during that turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a highly specialized **Anti-Meta/Anti-Setup** tool. It is particularly effective in VGC (Doubles) to punish "Booster Energy" triggers, "Dragon Dance" sweeps, or "Weakness Policy" activations, as it provides reliable burn status to neutralize physical attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide range of Fire-type Pokémon and several "jealous" or "emotional" themed Pokémon (e.g., Mimikyu, Ninetales).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found within the **Kitakami** region. It can be discovered as a TM capsule in the overworld or rewarded through the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame. 
* **Crafting Recipe:** Once obtained, it can be crafted at any TM Machine using the following materials:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Vulpix Fur**
    * **3x Litwick Soot**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. TMs are strictly artificial items crafted by the League or found in the field.
