## Identity & Utility
**TM04** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation III** (in its current iteration teaching Calm Mind).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In its most prominent form, it teaches the move **Calm Mind**, a psychic-type status move where the user focuses their mind to enhance mental fortitude. It is a **Consumable** item (in most generations) that **Can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Very Expensive**). The high price tag reflects its status as a high-tier competitive setup move.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Calm Mind** to a compatible Pokémon. Calm Mind raises the user's **Special Attack** and **Special Defense** stats by one stage (+1) each. 
    * *Historical Note:* In Generation I, TM04 taught **Whirlwind**. In Generation II, it taught **Rollout**. Since Generation III, it has been the standard for Calm Mind.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling in a meaningful way or have 0 power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Calm Mind is the premier setup move for "Bulky Special Attackers." It is a defining move in competitive formats (Smogon and VGC) for Pokémon like Suicune, Latias, Clefable, and Tapu Fini, allowing them to become both harder to kill and more threatening offensively simultaneously.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to "compatible" Pokémon, which primarily includes Psychic, Fairy, and Ghost types, as well as many "legendary" or "mystical" Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in major **Department Stores** (e.g., Lilycove City, Veilstone City) or awarded by Psychic-type Gym Leaders (notably **Tate and Liza** in the Hoenn region). Its 50,000 Poké Dollar price point makes it one of the most expensive purchasable TMs in the series.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased, found as a field item, or received as a quest reward. In newer generations (Gen IX), it can be crafted at a TM Machine using Pokémon materials (typically Psychic-type essences).
