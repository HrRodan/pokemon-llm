## Identity & Utility
**Banana** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A sweet and nutritious fruit used primarily as a filling for sandwiches during picnics. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought at various retail outlets across the Paldea region.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, it contributes to the creation of **Meal Powers**. Specifically, it is a key ingredient for increasing **Exp. Point Power** (especially for Normal-type Pokémon) and contributes to **Encounter Power** and **Raid Power** depending on the combination of other ingredients and condiments.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held or used in battle. Its value lies entirely in the **overworld/preparation** phase for breeding, training, or shiny hunting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a component of the **Picnic/Sandwich-making mechanic**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available for purchase at **Sure Cans**, **Deli Cioso**, and **Aguas Maiz** supermarkets throughout Paldea (e.g., in Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held** by any wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It must be purchased or occasionally received as a reward from specific NPCs or Tera Raid Battles.
