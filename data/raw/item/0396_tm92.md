## Identity & Utility
**TM92** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A data-encoding disc used to teach a permanent move to a compatible Pokémon. As an "All-Machine" category item, its specific move contents vary by generation: most famously teaching **Trick Room** (Gen IV-VII, IX) and **Mystical Fire** (Gen VIII).
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (Extremely Expensive). This high price point reflects its status as a late-game utility or high-tier tactical move.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a Pokémon.
    * **Trick Room (Main Iteration):** Creates a bizarre area where slower Pokémon move first for five turns. It is a -7 priority move.
    * **Mystical Fire (Gen VIII):** Deals Fire-type damage and lowers the target's Special Attack stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling or have 0 base power in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Archetype-Defining.** As "Trick Room," this TM is the cornerstone of an entire competitive playstyle (Trick Room teams). It allows slow, bulky sweepers (like Ursaluna, Torkoal, or Iron Hands) to dominate the field. In its "Mystical Fire" iteration, it serves as valuable coverage and utility for Fairy and Psychic types to check Special Attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in older generations (IV-VII) but became infinite-use in certain titles before returning to a craftable/consumable format in Gen IX.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired in the late-game or post-game. 
    * In **Sinnoh (Gen IV)**, it is found at the Hotel Grand Lake.
    * In **Galar (Gen VIII)**, it is purchased from the Wyndon Pokémon Center for a premium price.
    * In **Paldea (Gen IX)**, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using materials like Mimikyu Scraps and Bronzor Fragments.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured human technology, often distributed by Gym Leaders or found in high-security locations.
