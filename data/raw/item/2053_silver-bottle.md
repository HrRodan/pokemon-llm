## Identity & Utility
**Silver Bottle** is a **Picnic** customization item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This is a cosmetic accessory used specifically during the Picnic mechanic in the Paldea region. Unlike medicines or held items, it is a reusable tool used to change the visual theme of the player's picnic layout. It is a **non-consumable** item that can be purchased from specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Given its purely aesthetic nature, it is considered a luxury purchase for players looking to fully customize their overworld experience.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When selected in the Picnic customization menu, it replaces the default water/condiment bottle on the picnic table with a sleek, silver-themed bottle. This change is entirely visual and provides no mechanical bonuses to Meal Powers or sandwich making.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the overworld Picnic mini-game and has no impact on competitive battling, IVs, EVs, or move sets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it remains in the "Other Items" or specialized Picnic bag pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Silver Bottle is primarily available for purchase at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities, such as **Cascarrafa**, **Levincia**, and **Mesagoza**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or acquired through specific NPC interactions related to the Picnic mechanic. Its high price point marks it as a mid-to-late-game collection goal for players focusing on the "Living Dex" of items or aesthetic completion.
