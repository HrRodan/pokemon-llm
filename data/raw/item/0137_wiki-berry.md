## Identity & Utility
**Wiki Berry** is a **Picky-healing Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A restorative botanical item that can be held by a Pokémon. It is designed to provide emergency healing during battle but carries a flavor-based risk. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically purchasable but primarily acquired through cultivation.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **50% or below**, the berry is consumed to restore **1/8 (12.5%)** of the user's maximum HP. 
    * *Flavor Penalty:* If the Pokémon dislikes **Dry** flavors—specifically those with Natures that lower **Special Attack** (Adamant, Impish, Jolly, Careful)—it will become **Confused** after consuming the berry.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the healing and potential confusion effect on the target).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Rock-type** attack with **100 Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically a top-tier staple in Generation VII (when it restored 50% HP), it is now a **Niche** choice in current formats. It is primarily used on Pokémon with the **Gluttony** ability (like Snorlax or Alolan Muk), which allows them to consume the berry at 50% HP rather than the standard "pinch" range, though it is often passed over for Sitrus Berries or other "Picky" berries that suit the specific Pokémon's nature.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Interacts with the **Ripen** ability (doubles HP restoration).
    * Can be recycled via **Harvest** or **Recycle**.
    * Synergizes with **Belch** (can be used only after a berry is consumed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in Berry patches across various regions (Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos) or obtained from NPCs who give out daily berries. In modern titles, it is often found under sparkling spots in the overworld or via the Berry Tree mechanic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not listed as being held by any specific wild Pokémon species in the provided data; however, it is frequently gathered in bulk via the **Pickup** ability in various generations or grown in the **Poke Pelago/Berry Fields**.
* **Lore context:** The Wiki Berry is known for its distinct purple color and dry profile, making it the counterpart to the Figy (Spicy), Aguav (Bitter), Mago (Sweet), and Iapapa (Sour) berries.
