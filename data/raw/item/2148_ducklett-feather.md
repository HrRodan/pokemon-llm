## Identity & Utility
**Ducklett Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A shed feather from a Ducklett. It is a specialized crafting resource used primarily at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or converted into League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 15 Poké Dollars (Negligible/Resource value). It is primarily traded for LP rather than bought with cash.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is utilized in the creation of Flying- and Water-type moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard TM materials generally lack specialized Fling effects and are not intended for held-item combat).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in VGC or Smogon formats; its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy for team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX "Pokémon Materials" system, which encourages players to seek out specific wild encounters to unlock move-teaching capabilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching members of the **Ducklett** evolutionary line (Ducklett and Swanna). In the Paldea region's DLC areas (such as Kitakami), these feathers can also be found as sparkling pickups on the ground in wetlands and ponds.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense for thieving (via Covet or Thief), it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Ducklett** and **Swanna**. It is a common resource for trainers looking to teach high-tier Flying-type moves like **Brave Bird** or utility moves like **Air Cutter**.
