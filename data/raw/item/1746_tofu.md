## Identity & Utility
**Tofu** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A soft, protein-rich food item used exclusively as a filling for sandwiches during Picnics. It is a **Consumable Crafting** item that can be bought at specific retail outlets once the trainer has progressed sufficiently through the regional gym challenge.
* **Cost:** 260 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in sandwich crafting, Tofu contributes significantly to the **Normal-type** Meal Powers. It is a primary ingredient for increasing **Encounter Power: Normal**, **Raid Power: Normal**, and **Catching Power: Normal**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Out-of-Battle Utility).** While it has no impact on competitive PvP battles (VGC/Smogon), it is highly valued by competitive breeders and shiny hunters for its ability to target specific Pokémon types in the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Picnic mechanic**; the quality of the sandwich determines the duration and level (Lv. 1-3) of the resulting Meal Powers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the Paldea region. It can be purchased from the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. Note: This item only becomes available for purchase after the player has earned at least **five Gym Badges**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, Tofu must be sourced through commercial vendors in urban centers.
