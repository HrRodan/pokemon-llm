## Identity & Utility
**Rockruff Rock** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This is a crafting reagent dropped by members of the Rockruff evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or, more importantly, exchanged at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create specific TMs. It is **not** a held item and cannot be used directly in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard crafting value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. Players combine these rocks with League Points (LP) to teach various moves to their Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in the Fling mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a progression and customization item used exclusively in the overworld menu or at Pokémon Centers to expand a Pokémon's move pool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Technical Machine Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild Pokémon after battle, regardless of whether the Pokémon is defeated or caught. It is commonly farmed in rocky or mountainous areas where the Rockruff line is prevalent.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop from wild **Rockruff** and **Lycanroc** (Midday, Midnight, and Dusk forms). In the ecosystem of the Paldea region, these materials represent biological traces or environmental fragments associated with specific species.
