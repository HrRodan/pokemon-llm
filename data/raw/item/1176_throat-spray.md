## Identity & Utility
**Throat Spray** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A specialized performance-enhancing spray that boosts the user's offensive capabilities following a vocal performance. It is a **consumable held item** that triggers automatically when the holder executes a sound-based move. 
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; typically found in specialized boutiques or battle-focused shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a **sound-based move** (e.g., *Hyper Voice, Boomburst, Overdrive, Torch Song, or Clanging Scales*), the Throat Spray is consumed to raise the holder's **Special Attack by one stage (+1)**. The boost occurs after the move's damage/effect is resolved.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low utility; flinging this item deals minor damage and does not trigger the Special Attack boost for the thrower).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **high-tier competitive item** for specific offensive sweepers. It is highly valued in VGC and Smogon formats because it allows a Pokémon to set up offensive pressure while simultaneously dealing damage. It is a staple for Pokémon with the **Punk Rock** (Toxtricity) or **Liquid Voice** (Primarina) abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly for combat and does not trigger any known Pokémon evolutions. Because it is consumed upon use, it is a primary target for the **Unburden** ability or **Recycle** strategies.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in post-game Battle Towers or high-end retail locations (like Delibird Presents in Paldea). In its debut region, Galar, it was a common reward for trainers focusing on competitive battling circuits.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not currently found on wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through currency purchase or found as a static "Poké Ball" item in the overworld. Its presence in an inventory signals a strategic focus on sound-based offensive cores.
