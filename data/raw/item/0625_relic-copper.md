## Identity & Utility
**Relic Copper** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An ancient copper coin dating back approximately 3,000 years. It serves no functional purpose in battle or exploration and is classified as "vendor trash"—an item intended solely to be sold for profit. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **Cannot** be purchased from standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is derived entirely from its resale price to specific NPCs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Relic Copper is used to generate currency. While it can be sold at any shop for a low price, its primary utility is being sold to a specialized "Maniac" collector (specifically the Ore Collector in Undella Town) for **1,000 Poké Dollars**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage with no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages. It is strictly a "Playthrough" item used to fund the purchase of competitive supplies like Vitamins or TMs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It does not interact with any known abilities except for **Fling**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found within the **Abyssal Ruins** in the Unova region. It represents the lowest tier of the "Relic" treasure series (which includes the Relic Silver, Gold, Vase, Band, Statue, and Crown). It can also be obtained through the **Pickup** ability in certain games or as a reward from specific NPCs/Hidden Grottos.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically discovered as a hidden item or found in treasure chests within ancient ruins, emphasizing its lore as a remnant of a lost civilization.
