## Identity & Utility
**TR56 (Technical Record 56)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the knowledge of the move **Aura Sphere** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs (Technical Machines) in its debut generation, this TR is consumed upon use. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that can be purchased using Watts or found in the field.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for high-tier moves, though primarily transacted via Watts in the Galar region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Aura Sphere**. Aura Sphere is a Special Fighting-type move with a Power of 80 that **bypasses accuracy checks**, meaning it never misses regardless of the target's evasiveness or the user's accuracy (unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage output when used with the move Fling, though it consumes the item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Viable.** Aura Sphere is a premium Special Fighting-type coverage move. It is favored by Special Attackers (e.g., Lucario, Togekiss, Blastoise) as a more reliable, albeit weaker, alternative to Focus Blast, which has notoriously low accuracy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "Aura" and "Pulse" themed Pokémon, as well as many legendary and mythical species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR56 is typically obtained by defeating Fighting-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (usually around 3,000 - 5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it must be acquired through raid rewards, specialized shops, or Cram-o-matic recipes. Items like this represent the "technical records" of powerful techniques once widely taught but now requiring specific data to master.
