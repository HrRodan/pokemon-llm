## Identity & Utility
**TM171 (Tera Blast)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** This TM teaches the move **Tera Blast**, a versatile move that serves as the centerpiece of the Terastallization mechanic. It is a **Consumable/Single-use** item in Gen IX (though it can be crafted repeatedly).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is primarily acquired through story progression or crafted using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Tera Blast**. 
    * **Tera Blast Details:** A Normal-type move (80 Power, 100 Accuracy) that, when the user has Terastallized, changes its type to match the user’s **Tera Type**. It also automatically chooses between the user's **Attack** or **Special Attack** stat, whichever is higher, to deal damage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Staple.** Tera Blast is the primary way for many Pokémon to utilize their Tera Type offensively, providing crucial coverage that the Pokémon might otherwise lack (e.g., a Tera Ground Regieleki using Tera Blast to hit Ground-types).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is specifically designed to interact with the **Terastallization** mechanic unique to the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM171 is specifically associated with **The Indigo Disk** expansion. It is typically awarded to the player after reaching a specific milestone in the DLC story at the Blueberry Academy or found as a high-value item in the Terarium.
* **Crafting Requirements:** As part of the Gen IX TM Machine system, it can be crafted using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials:
    * **8,000 LP**
    * **Glimmet Crystals** (x3)
    * **Happiny Dust** (x3)
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. TMs are man-made devices; however, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Glimmet/Glimmora** and **Happiny/Chansey/Blissey**.
