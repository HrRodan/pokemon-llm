## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ari617)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event-trigger item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it summons a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though effectively a placeholder value as the item is distributed via special promotional means rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Orbeetle**. This allows players to challenge the encounter regardless of the standard raid den rotations or weather conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Indirect. While the item itself has no battle effect, it is used to farm high-IV Pokémon, Hidden Abilities (HA), or Gigantamax-capable specimens for competitive team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily distributed via **serial codes** or special promotional events (such as retail tie-ins or official guidebooks). It is not available through regular shops or the Watt Traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a special acquisition item intended for raid-den manipulation. 
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar particles or localized energy spikes that force a Dynamax encounter to manifest at a specific historical site (the Watchtower). The "ari" prefix in the internal name likely refers to its specific encounter ID in the game's database.
