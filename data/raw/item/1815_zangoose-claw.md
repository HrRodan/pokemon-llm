## Identity & Utility
**Zangoose Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by Zangoose after battle. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any effect.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars / League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a localized currency/component for crafting TMs. It is combined with League Points (LP) and other Pokémon-specific materials to create permanent move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its value is strictly for team preparation and move-pool optimization during the "pre-battle" phase of competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized under the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a reward for defeating or catching wild Zangoose in the Paldea region and other Generation IX locales. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Unlike traditional held items, this is a **guaranteed drop** from wild **Zangoose**. It is most efficiently gathered by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where Zangoose are indigenous (typically grassy or rocky biomes).
* **Lore Context:** The item represents the signature sharp claws of Zangoose, which are famously used to battle its rival, Seviper. The material is prized for crafting TMs that often involve slashing or physical contact moves.
