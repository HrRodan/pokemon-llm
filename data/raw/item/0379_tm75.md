## Identity & Utility
**TM75 (Swords Dance)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A data disc used to teach a compatible Pokémon a specific move. This specific TM teaches **Swords Dance**, a non-damaging Normal-type move that sharply raises the user’s Attack stat. It is a **Consumable/Instructional** item that is generally **Can** be bought in specific regions, though its reusability varies by generation (single-use in Gen 4 and Gen 9; infinite use in Gens 5–8).
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Swords Dance** to a compatible Pokémon. Swords Dance is a status move that increases the user's Attack stat by **two stages (+2)**, effectively doubling the Pokémon's physical damage output in a single turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used as held items in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Essential.** Swords Dance is arguably the most important physical setup move in the history of Pokémon. It is the cornerstone of "Setup Sweepers" (e.g., Garchomp, Scizor, Lucario, and Mimikyu), allowing them to break through defensive "walls" and end matches quickly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a vital component of the "Move Reminder" or "TM Crafting" economy in modern generations (Gen 9).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally available for purchase at major retail hubs like the **Veilstone Department Store** (Sinnoh) or the **Boutique** in various regions. In later games, it is often found as a reward for exploration or TM Crafting via the TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials (like Mankey Fur or Pawniard Fur).
* **Wild Held Item:** TM75 is **not** found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made device typically distributed by Gym Leaders, found in Poke Balls in the overworld, or purchased at high-end marts.
