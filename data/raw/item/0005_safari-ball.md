## Identity & Utility
**Safari Ball** is a **Standard Poké Ball** variant introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn).
* **Description:** Recognizable by its distinct camouflage pattern, this is a specialized tool designed for catching wild Pokémon within designated wilderness preserves. It is a **Consumable** item that **Cannot be bought** via traditional Poké Marts; instead, it is typically provided to trainers as part of an entry fee for specific preserves.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). It is traditionally lent to the player for use during a "Safari Game."

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to catch a wild Pokémon with a **1.5× Catch Rate modifier**. This effectiveness is identical to that of a Great Ball, providing a moderate advantage over a standard Poké Ball.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling in the contexts where it is traditionally provided).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Aesthetic.** In a competitive battle sense, the ball provides no mechanical advantage. However, in the "Aesthetic" community, Pokémon caught in a Safari Ball are highly valued for their rarity and the unique camouflage animation when the Pokémon enters the field.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Traditionally, this ball was restricted to the **Kanto Safari Zone**, **Hoenn Safari Zone**, and the **Sinnoh Great Marsh**. Using this ball outside these zones was historically impossible until its introduction as a rare collectible item in later generations (e.g., Sword/Shield via the Cram-o-matic).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically obtained by paying the entrance fee (500 Poké Dollars) at a **Safari Zone** or the **Great Marsh**, where the trainer receives a set of 30 balls. In modern titles like *Pokémon Sword/Shield* (Expansion Pass) and *Pokémon Scarlet/Violet*, it has become a "rare ball" (Apriball-tier) obtainable through high-tier rewards like the Cram-o-matic or the Porto Marinada Auction.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found held by wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through specific regional facilities or special end-game crafting/rewards. Its presence on a Pokémon typically signifies that the specimen was caught in a specialized ecological preserve.
