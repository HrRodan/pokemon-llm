## Identity & Utility
**Tanga Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A holdable berry that functions as a defensive contingency. If a Pokémon holding this berry is struck by a super-effective Bug-type move, the berry is consumed to drastically reduce the impact. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically purchasable but primarily acquired through cultivation or foraging.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is targeted by a super-effective Bug-type move, the Tanga Berry activates, halving the damage taken from that specific hit. It is consumed immediately after use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Bug-type** attack with **80 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Situational. It is most effective on Psychic, Dark, or Grass-type Pokémon that possess a 4x weakness to Bug-type moves, specifically to survive high-utility attacks like **U-turn** or high-priority threats like **First Impression**. It is a common choice for specific defensive sets in VGC or Smogon tiers where surviving a "Bug Buzz" or "Megahorn" is a win-condition.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It synergizes with abilities like **Unburden** (doubling speed after consumption), **Harvest** (allowing the berry to regrow), and **Ripen** (doubling the damage reduction to 75%).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found on Berry Trees or obtained via NPCs who gift berries daily. In many regions, it must be grown from a single seed to increase supply.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Spoink** and **Grumpig** (5% chance). These items can be efficiently farmed using the **Frisk** ability to identify the item and **Covet** or **Thief** to steal it.
