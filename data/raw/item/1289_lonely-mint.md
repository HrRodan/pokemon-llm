## Identity & Utility
**Lonely-mint** is a **Nature-mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal herb that modifies a Pokémon's stat growth pattern. When used, the Pokémon's **Attack** stat will increase more quickly (1.1x), while its **Defense** stat will increase more slowly (0.9x). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that, according to standard data, has a nominal cost but is typically gated behind special currency or late-game shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Special Acquisition**). *Note: While the base cost is listed low, in-game acquisition usually requires 50 BP or 20,000 Poké Dollars at specialized pharmacies.*

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently alters the Pokémon's stat multipliers to match the **Lonely** nature (+Attack, -Defense). Importantly, it does **not** change the Pokémon's actual Nature name or its Berry flavor preferences (determined by its original nature), which is crucial for avoiding confusion from "Pinch Berries" like the Figy Berry.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility (Optimization).** Mints are essential for competitive play, allowing players to optimize legendary Pokémon or Shiny Pokémon caught with suboptimal natures. The Lonely nature is specifically used for **Mixed Attackers** that prioritize physical damage but are willing to sacrifice Physical Defense (often to preserve Special Defense for taking hits from special sweepers).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a training tool for competitive stat management.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sword/Shield), it is primarily available at the **Battle Tower** for Battle Points (BP). In Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), it is more widely accessible through **Chansey Supply** outlets and as a reward for high-level **Tera Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is an artificial/specialized cultivation item used by trainers to bypass the randomness of natural traits.
* **Context:** It represents the "Modern Training" era of Pokémon, moving away from repetitive breeding toward "Hyper Training" and stat customization of existing team members.
