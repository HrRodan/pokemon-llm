## Identity & Utility
**TM129 (Calm Mind)** is a **Machine** (Technical Machine) featured prominently in **Generation IX** (*Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*).
* **Description:** This item is a data-encoding disc used to teach the move **Calm Mind** to compatible Pokémon. In the context of the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, it is a consumable teaching tool that can be reproduced once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafting at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag, it teaches the move **Calm Mind**. This status move raises the user's **Special Attack** and **Special Defense** stats by one stage each (+1 SpA, +1 SpD).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Calm Mind is one of the most important setup moves in competitive Pokémon (VGC and Smogon). It allows "bulky sweepers" to simultaneously increase their damage output and their ability to tank special hits, often turning the tide of a match if the user is not forced out immediately.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is a one-time-use item, though it can be crafted infinitely provided the player has the necessary ingredients.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item in the overworld within the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy) during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. Once obtained, the recipe is added to the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM129, a trainer requires:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3 Stantler Hair**
    * **3 Indeedee Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; TMs are synthetic items developed by Silph Co. and other regional tech developers to expand a Pokémon's natural movepool.
