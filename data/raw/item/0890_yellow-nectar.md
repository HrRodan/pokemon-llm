## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Nectar** is a **Species-specific Form-change Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A vibrant flower nectar found primarily in meadow environments. It is a **Consumable** item used outside of battle to trigger a metamorphosis in specific avian Pokémon. Once used, the item is consumed.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on an **Oricorio** of any other style, it transforms the Pokémon into its **Pom-Pom Style**. This changes Oricorio's primary type to **Electric/Flying** and modifies the type of its signature move, *Revelation Dance*, to Electric.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as it **cannot be used during a battle**. However, the **Pom-Pom Style** it grants is highly valued in niche competitive formats (like lower Smogon tiers or specific VGC regulations) due to its excellent defensive typing and access to the *Dancer* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is not an evolution item but a **Form-Change catalyst**. It is part of a four-part nectar hierarchy (Red, Yellow, Pink, and Purple) that allows Oricorio to pivot between types to fit team composition.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Alola:** Found naturally by interacting with yellow flowers in **Melemele Meadow**.
    * **Paldea:** Readily available for purchase at **Delibird Presents** branches once the player has progressed significantly in the story.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon; it must be gathered from the environment or purchased from specialized vendors.
* **Lore context:** The nectar reflects the floral diversity of the Melemele Island ecosystem, directly influencing the biology and "dance style" of the local Oricorio population.
