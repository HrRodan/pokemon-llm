## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CRT4287** is a Dynamax Crystal introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, single-use consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Utility** item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Placeholder value; typically distributed via serial code rather than sold in marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) with this item in their inventory, it activates a Max Raid Battle. This specific crystal (CRT4287) is tied to **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching Pokémon. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess high IVs and Hidden Abilities, making them viable for competitive breeding or training.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Once used, the crystal is consumed, and the raid remains active until defeated or until the day ends.
