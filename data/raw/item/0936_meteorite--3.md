## Identity & Utility
**Meteorite--3** is a **Key Item** (technically categorized as "unused" in this specific data iteration) appearing in **Generation VII** (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A celestial stone obtained at the summit of Mt. Chimney. It emits a faint, mysterious glow and remains warm to the touch, suggesting latent cosmic energy. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While listed as having a placeholder effect in the raw data, within the context of the series and its Generation VII metadata, the Meteorite serves as the primary catalyst for **Deoxys's Forme Change**. By interacting with specific Meteorites found in various regions (such as at the Hokulani Observatory in Alola), a player can cycle Deoxys between its Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Formes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** While the item itself isn't held in battle, it is the sole mechanic allowing players to access **Deoxys-Speed** (a premier lead/hazard setter) or **Deoxys-Attack** (a top-tier glass cannon) in formats where Deoxys is permitted (Ubers/Anything Goes).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution but acts as a **Forme Change** trigger. It is a plot-critical item usually associated with Professor Cozmo in the Hoenn region, though this specific version is indexed for Alolan gameplay.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hoenn-based narrative (referenced by the flavor text), it is recovered from the Meteorite Machine at **Mt. Chimney** after defeating the leader of Team Magma or Team Aqua. In the Generation VII Alolan context, it serves as a legacy item or a specific script trigger for the Deoxys transformation site at **Hokulani Observatory**.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is unique and cannot be farmed or obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is traditionally handed over to Professor Cozmo in exchange for **TM27 (Return)** or kept to facilitate Deoxys’s environmental interactions.
