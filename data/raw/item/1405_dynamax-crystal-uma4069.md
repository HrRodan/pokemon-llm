## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA4069** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell area of the Galar Wild Area). It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be bought through traditional in-game vendors. Using it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this represents a nominal value in the game data, as the item is distributed via external serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it summons a specific Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle. While the flavor text uses a variable placeholder `[VAR (0000)]`, these crystals were historically used to distribute specific encounters—such as Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or version-exclusives—to players regardless of their game version.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for capturing Pokémon. However, the Pokémon caught via these raids often possess Hidden Abilities or high individual values (IVs), making them valuable "parent" Pokémon for competitive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Distribution Only.** Dynamax Crystals like UMA4069 were primarily distributed through serial codes via retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or Pokémon Center) and Japanese monthly magazines (like CoroCoro). They were used to provide early access to rare Pokémon or special Gigantamax forms.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is tied strictly to the Mystery Gift system and promotional events.
