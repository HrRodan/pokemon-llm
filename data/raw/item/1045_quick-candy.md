## Identity & Utility
**Quick Candy** is a **Vitamin** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy treat used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's performance. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought, though it is more commonly earned through gameplay mechanics. Within the "Candy" hierarchy, this is the **basic tier** item (preceding Quick Candy L and Quick Candy XL).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon, it increases that Pokémon’s **Speed stat** by 1 point through the **AV (Awakening Value)** system. Unlike traditional "Carbos" which grant Effort Values (EVs), Quick Candies can be used to raise a stat up to a maximum of 200 AVs, regardless of the Pokémon's level.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move *Fling* does not exist in the *Let's Go* series where this item is primarily used).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is **mandatory for LGPE-specific competitive formats** (Online Battles with "Normal Rules" enabled), as maximizing AVs is essential for optimal speed tiers. It is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats for Gen 8/9, as the Candy system was replaced by the return of traditional EVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a core component of the "stat-grinding" loop in the Kanto remake games, allowing players to bypass the standard 510 EV cap found in other generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by **transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak** (releasing them from the Pokémon Box). It is also frequently rewarded for achieving high **Catch Combos** of specific Pokémon that yield Speed-related rewards (e.g., catching many Pikachu or Pidgey).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered as a **post-capture reward**. In the context of *Let's Go*, it effectively replaces the "Effort Points" usually gained from defeating Pokémon in battle.
