## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1457** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area of Pokémon Sword and Shield. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the day. It is an event-exclusive item that is technically consumable but functions similarly to a Key Item in its distribution.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**). While it has a internal cost value, it is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts and is primarily obtained through serial codes or retail distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific den in the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—specifically **Gigantamax Centiskorch**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. This allows players to challenge and catch the Pokémon regardless of the usual raid den rotations or weather conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in Trainer-vs-Trainer battles. However, it is highly valuable for the "Preparation" phase of competitive play, as it grants guaranteed access to a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was a core mechanic in Generation VIII VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment and requires the player to have reached the Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional event item. In many regions, the **Tau1457** crystal was provided via serial codes from retailers (such as GameStop or EB Games) during special promotional periods to celebrate the launch of the *Sword & Shield* TCG sets or specific movie releases.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly an event distribution item and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief. 
* **Lore Context:** The "Tau" designation is part of a series of crystals (including Epsilon and others) that act as "lures" for Dynamax energy, concentrating it at the otherwise dormant Watchtower Lair to force a Gigantamax manifestation.
