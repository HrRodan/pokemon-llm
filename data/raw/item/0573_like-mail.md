## Identity & Utility
**Like Mail** is a **Social Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized piece of stationery featuring a "recommendation" theme, used for writing short, templated messages to other players. It is a **consumable social item** that can be bought in bulk. Once a message is written and given to a Pokémon, the item is tied to that Pokémon for delivery via trade. 
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a pre-defined list of words. When held by a Pokémon, this message is delivered to the recipient during a trade. The message can be read and then stored in the Trainer's PC or erased to make the item reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Item Security:** While a Pokémon is holding Like Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC**. 
    * **Anti-Thief Utility:** In battle, any move that attempts to forcibly remove, steal, or swap the item (such as **Thief, Covet, Trick, or Switcheroo**) will automatically fail. 
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Legacy.** In older competitive formats (specifically Gens II-V), Mail was occasionally used as a "sticky" item to prevent the holder from losing its item to *Trick* or *Knock Off*. However, it offers no statistical or tactical advantages beyond this protection, making it inferior to items like Mega Stones or Z-Crystals in later generations which have inherent protection.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the game's storage system by locking the holder out of the PC until the Mail is removed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Unova region (Generation V) and occasionally in later regions where Mail systems were supported (e.g., XY). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a retail item intended for player-to-player communication.
* **Lore Context:** Like Mail is part of a series of stationery items (such as Bloom Mail or Bridge Mail) designed to personalize the trading experience before the advent of more robust integrated chat systems in Nintendo's online services.
