## Identity & Utility
**Clothing Trunk** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in standard item indices but functioning as a vital utility) introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A lightweight, portable container designed to store and manage a variety of outfits and accessories for both the Trainer and their partner Pokémon. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; given as part of the story).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, it opens the customization menu. This allows the player to instantly change their clothing (hats, shirts, pants, shoes, bags) and their partner Pikachu or Eevee’s accessories (hats, glasses, clothing) while in the overworld.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides purely aesthetic benefits and has no impact on battle stats, typing, or move effectiveness.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is exclusively tied to the **Partner Pokémon** mechanic of the Kanto-revisit titles, facilitating the "Dress Up" feature.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!*, the player receives this item early in the journey (typically from the player's Mother after delivering Oak's Parcel) to manage the various gift outfits received from NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. As a unique Key Item, it cannot be traded, lost, or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
