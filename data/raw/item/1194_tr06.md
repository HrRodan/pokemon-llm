## Identity & Utility
**TR06 (Blizzard)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon the powerful Ice-type move **Blizzard**. Unlike TMs in its debut generation, TRs are consumed upon use. It is a **Consumable Machine** that represents a high-tier offensive resource.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high currency value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) at Watt Traders in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Blizzard** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Blizzard is a Special Ice-type move with 110 Power and 70% Accuracy. It targets all adjacent opponents in double battles and has a 10% chance to freeze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 110 (Extremely High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Niche/Weather-Dependent).** Blizzard is a staple in competitive VGC and Smogon formats when used on "Hail" (or "Snow") teams. Under the effects of Hail/Snow, Blizzard bypasses the accuracy check to become 100% accurate. Its ability to hit both opponents in Doubles makes it a premier spread-damage move for Ice-type attackers like Kyurem, Glaceon, or Alolan Ninetales.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Water and Ice-type Pokémon, as well as several "Special Attacker" archetypes (e.g., Nidoking).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR06 is primarily acquired by defeating Ice-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 8,000 Watts). It is also occasionally available at the Cram-o-matic in the Isle of Armor.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. As a Technical Record, it is considered a piece of "recorded data" containing move instructions, differentiating it from the more durable Technical Machines (TMs) of the same era.
