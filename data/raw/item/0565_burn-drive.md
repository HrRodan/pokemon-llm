## Identity & Utility
**Burn Drive** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized high-tech cassette designed specifically for the Mythical Pokémon **Genesect**. When held, it physically modifies the drive slot on Genesect's back to glow red. It is a permanent held item that cannot be consumed and is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired as a Key/Event item or via specific NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Changes the type of Genesect's signature move, **Techno Blast**, from Normal-type to **Fire-type**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Deals physical damage but provides no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. In competitive formats (like Smogon Ubers or VGC when permitted), Genesect typically prefers items that boost its overall damage or speed, such as **Choice Scarf** or **Life Orb**. However, the Burn Drive is used specifically when a team requires a powerful 120-Base Power Fire-type coverage move to surprise Steel-type walls like **Ferrothorn**, **Scizor**, or **Corviknight** without the damage reduction of Life Orb or the locking effect of Choice items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item only functions with **Genesect**. It has no effect on other Pokémon and does not trigger evolution. It bypasses the effects of moves or abilities that would remove a "Plate" or "Drive" if the mechanic is locked to the species in specific generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Black/White), it was obtained at the **P2 Laboratory** after defeating a Scientist. In subsequent games, it is usually gifted by an NPC (such as in the Fossil Lab in Kalos or the Heahea City Game Freak office in Alola) if the player has a Genesect in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a Mythical-only accessory, it is treated as a unique piece of equipment tied to the lore of Team Plasma's cybernetic modifications.
