## Identity & Utility
**Air Balloon** is a **Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized floatation device to be held by a Pokémon. It grants the holder a "floating" status, rendering them immune to ground-based threats until the balloon is popped by an attack. It is a **Consumable Held Item** (it bursts upon taking damage) that can be bought.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** pricing for competitive held items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While the balloon is intact, the holder is completely immune to **Ground-type moves**, **Spikes**, **Toxic Spikes**, and the **Arena Trap** ability. 
* **Mechanics & Limitations:** 
    * The item is **consumed** (bursts) immediately when the holder takes direct damage from an opponent's move. 
    * The effect is nullified if **Gravity** is in effect or if the Pokémon uses **Ingrain**. 
    * Typically, message text ("The Pokémon is floating on an Air Balloon!") triggers upon the Pokémon's entry into battle, alerting the opponent to its presence.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; usually a waste of the item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Utility Niche**. It is a staple on Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Ground-type moves, most notably **Heatran**, allowing them to switch in safely or stay on the field against Ground-type threats. It is also used on **Magnezone** to bypass Arena Trap or Ground-type coverage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a tactical defensive tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized Battle Facilities (like the Battle Subway or Battle Tree) for BP, or at high-end department stores in various regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Can rarely be found on wild **Drifblim**. Trainers often use the **Thief** or **Covet** moves to harvest these from wild encounters.
* **Context:** In Nuzlocke challenges, this item is highly prized for providing a temporary "safety net" against high-damage Ground moves like Earthquake.
