## Identity & Utility
**Lure Ball** is a **Specialized Poké Ball (Apricorn Ball)** introduced in Generation II (re-indexed in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball designed specifically for aquatic encounters. It is a **Consumable** item used to capture wild Pokémon. Unlike standard Poké Balls, it cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts and is traditionally handcrafted.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is derived from its rarity as a "boutique" ball rather than its retail price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a wild Pokémon encountered while fishing (using any Rod), the Lure Ball has a **3× Catch Rate multiplier**. If used on a Pokémon encountered through any other method (tall grass, caves, etc.), it functions as a standard Poké Ball with a **1× multiplier**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling in a way that provides utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no in-battle stat benefits, the Lure Ball is highly prized in the competitive community for **Aesthetics and Breeding**. Competitive players often seek "Apriball" variants to match the color palette of Water-type Pokémon (like Azumarill or Gyarados) for visual prestige.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** None. It does not trigger any specific evolutions or interact with abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically crafted by the artisan **Kurt in Azalea Town (Johto)** using **Blue Apricorns**. In more recent generations (Gen VII and VIII), it is often obtained as a one-time gift from NPCs (like Ball Guy in Galar) or as a rare reward from the Cram-o-matic or Ace Academy Tournament.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a trainer-utility item that must be acquired through specialized crafting or rare event distributions.
