## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6027** is a specialized Event Item (categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).

*   **Description:** This item functions as a beacon for Dynamax energy. When brought to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased via standard Poke Marts.
*   **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Functionally **Not for Sale**; the cost is a nominal internal value as these are acquired via special distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to initiate a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the "SCO6027" variant is programmed to summon **Stonjourner**. This allows players to face the Pokémon regardless of version exclusivity or standard weather-based spawn rates.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling mechanics).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no in-battle effect, it is used by competitive players to farm high-IV (Individual Value) specimens, specific Natures, or Hidden Abilities from the resulting Raid encounter. 
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a utility item for world interaction within the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** This is a **Distribution Item**. It was typically made available through serial codes provided during retail promotions (such as pre-order bonuses or specific store collaborations). It is not found through natural exploration or standard gameplay loops.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard held items, Dynamax Crystals are external catalysts used to manipulate the Den mechanics of the Galar region. 
*   **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals are concentrated shards of Dynamax energy that can force a "Power Spot" to activate instantly, bypassing the natural recharge cycle of the Wishing Pieces.
