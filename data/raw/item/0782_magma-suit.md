## Identity & Utility
**Magma Suit** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in Generation VI (specifically within the *Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire* titles, though cataloged in later generation data).
* **Description:** A high-tech, heavy-duty protective suit developed using the peak technological expertise of Team Magma. It is engineered to withstand extreme physical impacts and high-temperature environments. As a Key Item, it is **not for sale** and cannot be traded or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique story item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Magma Suit serves a critical narrative and functional role during the "Delta Episode" and the climax of the Primal Groudon encounter. It specifically **allows the player to ride on Groudon's back** into the deepest parts of the Cave of Origin, protecting the trainer from the intense heat and pressure generated by Primal Reversion.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and overworld cinematic sequences. It provides no statistical or tactical advantage in trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities. It functions strictly as a "flag" in the game's code to permit access to restricted story areas.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a gift during the main storyline of *Pokémon Omega Ruby* (and during the Delta Episode in both versions). It is typically handed to the player by **Maxie**, the leader of Team Magma, acknowledging the player's role in stabilizing the Hoenn region's environmental crisis.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological marvel within the Pokémon world lore, representing the intersection of human engineering and Legendary Pokémon mastery.
