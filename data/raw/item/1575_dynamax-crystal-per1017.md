## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (per1017)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the encounter remains active until the end of the day. It functions as a single-use "key" for rare encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/System placeholder; typically not obtainable via standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone tower in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the player can use this crystal to initiate a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. While the flavor text uses a placeholder `[VAR (0000)]`, these specific crystals were historically used for event distributions (such as Larvitar, Jangmo-o, or Gigantamax Copperajah/Duraludon).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for obtaining specific Pokémon, often with unique moves, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax factors, which can then be trained for competitive use.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event-Exclusive Distribution**. In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed via serial codes from retailers (like GameStop, Target, or GAME) or as pre-order bonuses. The "per1017" designation refers to a specific internal ID for a promotional distribution.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a digital-only event trigger.
