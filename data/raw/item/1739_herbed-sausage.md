## Identity & Utility
**Herbed-sausage** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A seasoned, savory meat item used specifically in the **Picnic** mechanic for crafting sandwiches. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be purchased from specific food vendors. It has no direct use in battle or on the overworld outside of the sandwich-making minigame.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a component in a sandwich, it contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. It primarily provides a balance of flavors (Salty, Bitter, and Savory) which influence the type and level of bonuses received, such as Encounter Power, Exp. Point Power, or Raid Power.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle; it resides in the Ingredients bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has zero utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as its effects are limited to the Paldea region's meal-power mechanics which boost out-of-battle activities (like shiny hunting or breeding).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it interacts with the **Picnic mechanic**, where stacking it correctly determines the success of the sandwich.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** outlets across the Paldea region (e.g., Mesagoza, Cortondo, Levincia) and at the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. It is typically unlocked for purchase after obtaining a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a commercial food product found in urban retail locations. It is a staple ingredient for Trainers looking to create higher-tier recipes like the "Herby Sausage Sandwich" series.
