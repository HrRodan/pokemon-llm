## Identity & Utility
**Seal-Bag** is an **Unused / Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Originally designed as a tiny bag intended to hold ten Seals for decorating Poké Balls. In the final release of *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, this item remained in the game's code but was replaced by the **Seal Case** for actual gameplay. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Based on internal data, the item was intended to serve as a storage container for up to ten Seals. Seals are cosmetic stickers applied to Ball Capsules to create special visual effects (sparks, smoke, bubbles) when a Pokémon is sent out from its Poké Ball.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on battle statistics or mechanics; it is a purely cosmetic management tool that went unused.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution and has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Not obtainable** through normal gameplay. It exists strictly within the game's data as a leftover asset from the development of the Sinnoh region's Poké Ball customization system. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon.
* **World Knowledge:** The Seal-Bag is considered a "Beta Item." The developers ultimately implemented the **Seal Case**, which had a much higher capacity (holding up to 10-20 of each Seal type), rendering this "ten-count" bag redundant before the games' release. It serves as a historical artifact of the development process for Generation IV's contest and customization mechanics.
