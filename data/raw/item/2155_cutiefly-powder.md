## Identity & Utility
**Cutiefly Powder** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A material dropped by members of the Cutiefly evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Reagent** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine. While it has a technical "cost," it is primarily gathered through gameplay rather than purchased.
* **Cost:** 25 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common resource**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item functions exclusively as a **crafting ingredient**. It is used at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers to create specific Technical Machines (TMs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive or casual battles and cannot be held by a Pokémon for an in-battle effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its sole purpose is the acquisition of moves via the TM crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the regions where Cutiefly and Ribombee reside (primarily within the **Paldea** region's DLC areas, such as the land of Kitakami). It is obtained automatically after defeating or catching a wild Cutiefly or Ribombee.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Cutiefly** and **Ribombee**. Players often farm this material by using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature to quickly clear spawns of these Pokémon.
