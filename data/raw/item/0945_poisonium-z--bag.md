## Identity & Utility
**Poisonium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is the inventory representation of the Poison-type Z-Crystal. It converts Z-Power into crystals that upgrade a Pokémon's Poison-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Key Item/Held Item hybrid** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition; Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one **Poison-type move**, it allows the Pokémon to execute the Z-Move **Acid Downpour**. The power and category (Physical or Special) of Acid Downpour depend on the base move used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VII).** In the Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon eras, Z-Crystals were meta-defining. Poisonium Z was frequently used on offensive Poison types like **Nihilego**, **Gengar**, or **Salazzle** to bypass defensive walls or secure a "nuke" KO that standard moves couldn't achieve.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Permanent Attachment:** Z-Crystals cannot be removed from a Pokémon in battle by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, nor can they be suppressed by the ability *Klutz*.
    * **Requirement:** The user must be wearing a Z-Ring or Z-Power Ring to activate the crystal's power.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a plot-related gift during the Island Challenge. In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is found in the **Shady House** (Poletown) after defeating Team Skull. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is given by **Plumeria** on Poni Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact associated with the Alolan Z-Move mechanic. It is categorized in the "bag" data to distinguish the player's possession of the crystal from the version actually held by a Pokémon in battle.
