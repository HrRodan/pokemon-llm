## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CMI2845** is a **Special Event Consumable** (categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This item is a promotional tool used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, the designated Pokémon remains available for encounter until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use event item that cannot be used in standard battle scenarios.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a defined price, it is not available for purchase at standard Poké Marts; the cost is a placeholder for an item primarily distributed via serial codes or Mystery Gifts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone structure in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it emits a pillar of light, forcing a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (determined by the internal ID CMI2845).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate encounters and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the Raid Den. If the player loses the battle, they can usually re-attempt the raid until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is caught.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Promotional Events**. Items with the "CMI" prefix are typically linked to retail distributions (such as CoroCoro, GameStop, or Best Buy) or special movie tie-ins. They are not found through normal gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**; they are strictly tied to the Mystery Gift system and special event distributions in the Galar region.
