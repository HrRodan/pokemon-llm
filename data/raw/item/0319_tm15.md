## Identity & Utility
**TM15 (Hyper Beam)** is an **all-machine** (Technical Machine) introduced in **Generation I** (though specific data indicates this instance's indexing in Generation III).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Hyper Beam**. It is a **Consumable** (in early and recent gens) or **Reusable** (Gens V-VIII) item that **Can** be bought. It represents one of the most iconic high-power moves in the franchise.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**—though in many core games, this specific TM is often valued much higher, typically between 7,500 and 50,000 Poké Dollars).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hyper Beam** to a compatible Pokémon. Hyper Beam is a Special Normal-type move with 150 Base Power. The target is blasted with a powerful beam, but the user must spend the next turn recharging, making them vulnerable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/High-Risk.** While it offers immense burst damage, the recharge turn is a significant liability in competitive singles (Smogon). It sees occasional play in VGC (Doubles) as a Max Move base in Dynamax formats or on Pokémon with the **Pixilate**, **Refrigerate**, or **Galvanize** abilities which convert the move type and boost its power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of fully evolved Pokémon, often serving as the "ultimate" move for Normal-types or high-Special Attack sweepers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available at **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, Lilycove City) or as a premium prize at **Game Corners**. In modern titles like *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, TMs must be found as overworld items, received from NPCs, or purchased from specialized vendors.
