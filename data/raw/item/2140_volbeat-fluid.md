## Identity & Utility
**Volbeat Fluid** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a specialized biological material or drop collected from members of the Volbeat evolutionary line. It is classified as a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Material Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its primary purpose is to serve as a component for **crafting Technical Machines (TMs)** at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. It is combined with League Points (LP) to create specific moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** Not applicable (usually results in 10-30 power with no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and cannot be held or used in a competitive battle to influence stats or outcomes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Pokémon Materials" inventory tab, distinct from healing items or held battle items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching a wild **Volbeat** (and occasionally Illumise, depending on the game's specific encounter tables). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item in the traditional sense; rather, it is a **guaranteed or high-probability drop** upon the conclusion of a battle with the corresponding Pokémon.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Paldean ecosystem, materials like Volbeat Fluid represent the integration of natural Pokémon biology with the technological advancement of the TM Machine, allowing trainers to "manufacture" moves that were previously limited to single-use items or move tutors.
