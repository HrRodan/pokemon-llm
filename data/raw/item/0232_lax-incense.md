## Identity & Utility
**Lax Incense** is a specialized **Held Item** (Incense category) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A holdable item that emits a "beguiling aroma," causing psychological distraction to opponents. It is a dual-purpose item used primarily for breeding specific baby Pokémon or as a niche defensive tool in battle. It is a **Holdable** item that **can** be bought at specialty shops.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Premium price**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the holder’s **Evasion by 5%**. In practice, this multiplies the accuracy of any move targeted at the holder by 0.95.
* **Breeding Mechanic:** If a **Wobbuffet** holds this item while in a Daycare or Nursery, the resulting Egg will hatch into a **Wynaut**. Without the Lax Incense, the Egg would hatch directly into a Wobbuffet, skipping the baby stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Outclassed.** In competitive play (Smogon), Lax Incense is often banned under the "Evasion Clause." In formats where it is legal (VGC), it is considered strictly inferior to **Bright Powder**, which provides a superior 10% evasion boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates the acquisition of **Wynaut** (the baby trigger for the Wobbuffet evolutionary line).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in specialty "Incense" markets across various regions (e.g., Slateport City in Hoenn, Veilstone City in Sinnoh, or Hulbury in Galar). It is often located in areas associated with incense or rituals, such as Mt. Pyre.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from vendors or found as a static overworld item. It is not compatible with the **Pickup** ability for farming purposes.
