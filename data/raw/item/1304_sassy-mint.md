## Identity & Utility
**Sassy Mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable herb that, when smelled by a Pokémon, reconfigures its stat growth patterns. Specifically, it causes the Pokémon's **Special Defense** to increase more rapidly while its **Speed** increases more slowly. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought, though typically through specialized currency.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap in numerical value; however, in-game acquisition usually requires 20-50 Battle Points (BP) or high-tier League Points, making it a "Specialty Purchase").

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently changes the Pokémon's stat multipliers to match the **Sassy Nature** (+10% Special Defense, -10% Speed). Important Note: The Pokémon's actual "Nature" name remains unchanged in the summary screen (e.g., a "Jolly" Pokémon will still say "Jolly"), but the stat highlights (Red for buff, Blue for nerf) will update to reflect the Sassy Mint's influence.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary status effect upon hitting the target).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility / Meta Staple.** The Sassy Mint is essential for optimizing "Mixed Walls" or specialized tanks. It is particularly valuable for **Trick Room** teams, where a lowered Speed stat is advantageous, or for Pokémon that utilize moves like *Gyro Ball*. It allows players to "fix" the stats of legendary or Shiny Pokémon that weren't caught with the ideal nature.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is purely a performance-enhancing item used to bypass the need for intensive breeding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available at the **Battle Tower** (Gen VIII) or **Chansey Supply** shops (Gen IX). It can also be found as a rare reward for completing high-level Max Raid Battles or Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, Mints are synthetic or rare cultivated items and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or from wild encounters.
* **Lore:** The introduction of Mints revolutionized Pokémon training in the Galar region, allowing trainers to alter a Pokémon's potential without changing its inherent personality (Nature).
