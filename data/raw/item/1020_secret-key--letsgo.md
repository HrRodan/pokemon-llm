## Identity & Utility
**Secret Key (Let's Go)** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (*Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized key with a red decoration specifically designed to unlock the front door of the Cinnabar Island Pokémon Gym. It is a **Key Item**, meaning it is permanent, cannot be sold, and cannot be given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Secret Key serves as a "lock-and-key" flag for story progression. Without this item in the player's inventory, the Cinnabar Island Gym remains locked, preventing the player from challenging the Gym Leader, Blaine.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it is restricted to the inventory's Key Items pocket and cannot be used during battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any specific Pokémon abilities. Its sole interaction is with the overworld map trigger at the Cinnabar Gym door.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Secret Key is located deep within the **Pokémon Mansion** on Cinnabar Island. Players must navigate the ruins of the mansion and interact with various statues to flip switches and reach the lowest floor to find it.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item found via overworld exploration.
* **Context:** In the *Let's Go* series, finding the key is a mandatory step in the Kanto region journey, mirroring its role from the original 1996 titles. The red decoration is a aesthetic update for the 3D entry to make the item more visually distinct in the player's bag.
