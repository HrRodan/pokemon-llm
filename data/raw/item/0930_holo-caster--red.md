**Holo-caster--red** is an **Unused Item** originating in the data of **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** Described as a device for receiving and viewing hologram clips and chatting with others. Despite its flavor text, it is classified as an "unused" item within the Alolan game data (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon). It is a **Key Item-style artifact** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the context of Generation VII gameplay, this item has **no functional effect**. The internal data contains placeholder text ("XXX new effect"), indicating it was likely a leftover asset or a dummy entry during development. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a non-functional internal item and has no presence in any competitive format (VGC or Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution and has no interaction with any Pokémon abilities or world mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** While the Holo Caster was a central Key Item in the Generation VI (Kalos) region, this specific "red" variant exists only within the code of the Generation VII games as a remnant or placeholder. It cannot be found at any Mart or special location through legitimate gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The Holo Caster was the primary communication tool in Pokémon X and Y, used by characters like Professor Sycamore and Lysandre. Its appearance in the Alolan game data as "holo-caster--red" is a technical artifact of the engine's development, likely used for testing or as a legacy asset from the Kalos region's infrastructure.
