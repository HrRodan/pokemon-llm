## Identity & Utility
**Exercise Ball** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A recreational item used specifically during the Picnic mechanic. It is a **Consumable/Placeable accessory** that serves as a toy for the player's Pokémon. Unlike held items, it is interacted with in the overworld to foster bonds between the trainer and their party.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). It is readily available for purchase at specialized vendors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Picnic is set up, the player can deploy the Exercise Ball. Pokémon in the party will interact with it by kicking or pushing it around. This interaction serves as a "toy" mechanic, primarily used to increase the **Friendship (Happiness)** levels of the Pokémon in the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. Its value is entirely social and mechanical regarding Pokémon growth and evolution requirements (for Pokémon that evolve via high friendship).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not directly trigger an evolution (like a stone), it facilitates the **Friendship** mechanic required for evolutions such as Eevee (into Sylveon, Espeon, or Umbreon), Riolu, and Chansey.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased primarily at **Picnic Knacks** stores found in major Paldean hubs like Cascarrafa, Levincia, and Mesagoza. It can also be found in various colors/styles (though the mechanical function remains the same).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured commercial good within the Paldea region designed for trainer-Pokémon bonding.
* **Context:** This item represents the "leisure" side of Pokémon training, emphasizing the shift toward lifestyle mechanics and overworld interaction introduced in the Paldean region.
