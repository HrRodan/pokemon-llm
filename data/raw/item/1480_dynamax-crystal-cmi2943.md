## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CMI2943)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-specific consumable item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific, predetermined Pokémon. It is a **Special Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Technical Value**). While it has a data-defined cost, it is functionally priceless as it is obtained via external promotional codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon arrival at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, the player can use this crystal to cause a specific Dynamax Pokémon to appear in a Max Raid Battle. This encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is used from the Bag at a specific overworld location).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for the "Single Player" or "Co-op" experience of catching rare or version-exclusive Pokémon to be used later in competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the Max Raid Battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Only.** Dynamax Crystals (specifically those with "CMI" or numeric codes) were historically distributed via serial codes from retailers (like GameStop, Target, or GAME) or through Japanese magazines like *CoroCoro*.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-exclusive distribution item intended to bridge the gap for version-exclusive encounters or provide early-game access to specific species.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is unique because it remains inactive (empty) until a Dynamax Crystal is dropped into it, making it a "summoning" point for rare Galar energies.
