## Identity & Utility
**TR49 (Calm Mind)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Calm Mind** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use, mirroring the mechanics of TMs from earlier generations (I-IV).
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate). In practice, this item is frequently traded for **Watts** (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Calm Mind**, a non-damaging Psychic-type status move.
    * **Move Logic:** When used in battle, Calm Mind raises the user's **Special Attack** and **Special Defense** stats by one stage (+1) each. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Calm Mind is one of the most significant setup moves in competitive Pokémon history (Smogon/VGC). It is essential for "Bulky Setup Sweepers" (e.g., Tapu Fini, Clefable, Reuniclus), allowing them to simultaneously increase their offensive pressure and their ability to tank special hits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time consumable; once used, the item is removed from the bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR49 is primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword and Shield**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts (typically 2,000–8,000 W depending on the daily rotation).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is most commonly earned as a reward for defeating Psychic-type or high-tier Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Context:** The transition from TMs to TRs in Gen VIII allowed for the distribution of powerful, high-utility moves like Calm Mind through gameplay loops like Raids, preventing early-game imbalance while maintaining accessibility for competitive team building.
