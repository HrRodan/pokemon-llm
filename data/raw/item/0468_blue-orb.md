## Identity & Utility
**Blue Orb** is a **Plot-Advancement / Special Held Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A radiant, ancient artifact deeply tied to the mythology of the Hoenn region. It is a **Key Item** in earlier generations and a **Special Held Item** in later iterations (ORAS). It cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Legendary Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its capacity as a story item, it is used to summon or awaken the Legendary Pokémon **Kyogre** (specifically at the Embedded Tower in *HeartGold/SoulSilver* or Mt. Pyre/Sootopolis in Gen III). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Primal Reversion:** In *Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire* (and Gen VII), when held by Kyogre, it triggers **Primal Reversion** immediately upon entering battle. This transforms the holder into **Primal Kyogre**, significantly boosting its stats and replacing the weather with **Primordial Sea**.
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Staple.** In formats where Primal Reversion is permitted (such as Gen 6/7 Ubers or restricted VGC formats), this item is mandatory for Kyogre. Unlike Mega Stones, the Blue Orb does not count against the team's "One Mega per battle" limit, allowing for immense tactical flexibility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is not an evolution stone but acts as a temporary "Forme Change" catalyst. It cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by Kyogre.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively through main-story progression. It is typically found at **Mt. Pyre** in the Hoenn region or received from an NPC (such as Mr. Pokémon in *HeartGold*) to facilitate the capture of Kyogre.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, singular artifact.
* **Lore:** The Blue Orb contains the primal power of the sea. While it was originally used to control Kyogre in ancient legends, it eventually became the catalyst for Kyogre to reclaim its true, prehistoric power through Primal Reversion. It serves as the direct counterpart to the **Red Orb**.
