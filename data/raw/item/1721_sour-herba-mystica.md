## Identity & Utility
**Sour Herba Mystica** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A rare, legendary condiment imbued with mysterious properties. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** used exclusively during the Picnic mechanic to craft ultra-potent sandwiches. It **cannot be bought** at standard Marts or Deli Cioso locations.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). Its value is tied to its extreme rarity as a high-tier raid reward.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a Sandwich recipe, it provides a massive boost to Meal Powers. Specifically, it is a key component in "Sparkling Power," "Title Power," and "Humungo Power" Level 3 recipes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in traditional battles).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no direct utility in Smogon or VGC battles, it is **essential for competitive preparation**. It is used to hunt for "Competitive Shinies" and Marks, and to influence the size of Pokémon (important for the Jumbo/Mini Marks).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. However, in the *Path of Legends* storyline, it is one of the five Herba Mystica used to restore the health and forms of Koraidon/Miraidon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a rare drop from **5-Star and 6-Star Tera Raid Battles**. It is famously guarded by the "Titan Pokémon" found across the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is exclusively gathered through the **Tera Raid** system, particularly from specific Tera Raid bosses known for high drop rates (e.g., Blissey, Amoonguss, or Cetitan).
* **Lore Context:** Known as a "miracle herb," the Sour variant is said to provide an intense, sharp flavor that instantly revitalizes those who consume it, though its main gameplay draw is its ability to manipulate the encounter rates of Shiny Pokémon.
