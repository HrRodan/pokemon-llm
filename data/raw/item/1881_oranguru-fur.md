## Identity & Utility
**Oranguru Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of fur shed by an Oranguru. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for an effect. It is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create TMs.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient in the crafting recipes for various Technical Machines (TMs). For example, it is a required component for crafting **TM114 (Shadow Ball)** and **TM158 (Focus Blast)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for move-set optimization during the preparation phase (crafting), but it provides no tactical advantage in actual competitive matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution for any Pokémon. It is exclusively a resource for the Gen IX crafting mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild Oranguru upon being defeated or captured in the Paldea region (notably in the Tagtree Thicket or North Province).
* **Wild Held Item:** While it does not appear in the "held_by_pokemon" slot for traditional items, it is a **guaranteed drop** from wild **Oranguru**. Players often farm this material to gain access to powerful Special-Attacking TMs.
* **Lore:** The fur is indicative of the Sage Pokémon's presence in deep forests; it is often found in areas where these intelligent Pokémon gather to meditate or command other species.
