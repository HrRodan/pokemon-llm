## Identity & Utility
**Mega-Glove** is an **Unused / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically appearing in Pokémon X and Y) and cataloged within the **Generation VII** data.
* **Description:** This item is an aesthetic variation of the Mega Ring/Mega Bracelet. It consists of a glove containing a Key Stone, which allows a Trainer to trigger Mega Evolution in Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone. While the flavor text describes it as a source of "untold power," it is classified as an **Unobtainable NPC Key Item**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique plot item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Lore-wise, it functions as a **Key Stone** conduit. When a Trainer possesses this item and a Pokémon in their party holds a corresponding Mega Stone (e.g., Lucarionite), the Pokémon can Mega Evolve during battle, granting massive stat boosts and potential ability changes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Because this item is exclusive to an NPC, it has no presence in the competitive VGC or Smogon meta-games. Players utilize the standard *Mega Ring* (XY), *Mega Bracelet* (ORAS), or *Z-Ring/Mega Ring* (SM/USUM) instead.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically tied to the **Mega Evolution** mechanic. While it does not "evolve" a Pokémon permanently, it facilitates the temporary mid-battle transformation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** This specific item is hard-coded for **Gym Leader Korrina** of Shalour City. It serves as her personal method of channeling Mega Evolution. The player receives a different item (the Mega Ring) from her during the Tower of Mastery storyline, making the Mega Glove a unique NPC-only asset.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact associated with the lore of the **Tower of Mastery** and the Successor of Mega Evolution.
