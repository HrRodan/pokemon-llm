## Identity & Utility
**Lock Capsule** is an **Unused Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (HeartGold/SoulSilver).
* **Description:** Described as a sturdy capsule that requires a special key to open. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold. While it exists in the data of Generation IV games, it was intended to be transferred to Generation V.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale / Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the game's code, the Lock Capsule is a container designed to hold **TM95 (Snarl)**. Its primary function was to be transferred from a Generation IV game to a Generation V game (Black/White) via the **Relocator** system.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a plot/event item with no mechanical utility in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item was intended to be taken to a character named **Mr. Lock** in Castelia City (Generation V). He would open the capsule, rewarding the player with the TM for Snarl.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unreleased / Event Only.** Although the item is fully coded into *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*, the event to distribute it was never officially activated by Nintendo. As a result, it is impossible to obtain through legitimate gameplay without the use of external save-editing tools or cheats.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind event item.
* **Historical Context:** The Lock Capsule is a famous example of "lost" Pokémon content. It was designed as a bridge between the Sinnoh/Johto era and the Unova era, serving as the only way to obtain TM95 in the original *Black and White* games before the TM became more widely available in *Black 2 and White 2*.
