## Identity & Utility
**Charizardite-X** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos Region).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed for Charizard. When held by Charizard, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer has a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **not for sale** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Mega Stones are typically unique items obtained through story progression, specific NPCs, or post-game battle facilities.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the transformation of Charizard into **Mega Charizard X**. This transformation changes Charizard’s typing from Fire/Flying to **Fire/Dragon** and replaces its ability with **Tough Claws** (increasing the power of contact moves by 30%).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In competitive play, Mega Stones generally cannot be removed from the holder by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, and *Fling* will fail if the item is held by a Pokémon that can use it to Mega Evolve).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Mega Charizard X was a defining force in the Gen VI and VII competitive metas (Smogon OU and VGC). It functions as a premier physical setup sweeper using *Dragon Dance*, distinguishing it from the special-attack-oriented Mega Charizard Y.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is not a permanent evolution item. The effect is temporary and lasts only for the duration of a battle. It specifically interacts with Charizard; it has no effect on other Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (*Pokémon X*), it is obtained from Professor Sycamore in Lumiose City if the player chooses Charmander, or via late-game events. In later generations like *Sun/Moon*, it is purchasable only via Battle Points (BP) at the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is treated as a unique "Key-style" held item that remains in the player's inventory across the journey.
