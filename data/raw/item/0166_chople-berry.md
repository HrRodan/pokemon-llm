## Identity & Utility
**Chople Berry** is a **Type-protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A spicy-sweet Berry that functions as a reactive defensive tool. When held by a Pokémon, it automatically triggers to mitigate high-threat damage from Fighting-type maneuvers. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be bought for a nominal fee in specific regions, though it is more commonly cultivated or found in the wild.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is struck by a **super-effective Fighting-type attack**, the Chople Berry is consumed to reduce the damage of 그 attack by **50%**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally not used for Fling unless purely to trigger a teammate's Weakness Policy).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fighting-type** attack with **80 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-tier **Competitive Staple**. It is frequently equipped on Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Fighting (like **Tyranitar**, **Bisharp**, or **Aggron**) or high-value defensive pivots (like **Blissey** or **Empoleon**) to survive devastating moves such as *Close Combat*, *Low Kick*, or *Focus Blast*. It is particularly effective in VGC (doubles) for surviving targeted focus fire.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Consumed upon use; can be recovered via the **Harvest** ability or **Recycle** move. 
    * Its activation is blocked by the **Unnerve** ability. 
    * The damage reduction is boosted to 75% if the user has the **Ripen** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through Berry Masters, specialized shops, or by planting and harvesting in Berry patches. In many games, it is a rare reward from NPCs who trade Berries for specific items or words.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Buneary** and **Lopunny**. These can be farmed efficiently using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or gathered via the **Pickup** ability in certain level brackets (depending on the specific game version).
