## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA4518** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special, single-use consumable item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the specific Pokémon associated with the crystal will appear as a Dynamax encounter until the end of the day. It is a **Special Event Consumable** that is not typically obtainable through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**). While it has a nominal cost in the data, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is usually acquired via external promotional codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone structure in the Wild Area), it generates a Max Raid Battle beacon. This allows the player to battle and potentially catch a specific Pokémon that may not normally appear in that location or version of the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, these crystals are highly valued for competitive preparation as they often provide guaranteed encounters with Pokémon possessing 4-5 perfect IVs or specific **Hidden Abilities** required for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon the activation of the raid den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Special Acquisition.** These items are distributed through retail promotions (such as serial codes from GameStop, Best Buy, or Pokémon Center pre-orders). Unlike standard items, they cannot be farmed or purchased with Watts or Poké Dollars in-game.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly an event-driven inventory item.
