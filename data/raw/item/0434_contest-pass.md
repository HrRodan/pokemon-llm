## Identity & Utility
**Contest Pass** is a **Key Item** (classified as Gameplay) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An essential permit required for a Trainer to participate in Pokémon Contests. It is characterized by an illustration of an award ribbon on its front. As a Key Item, it resides in a dedicated pocket of the Bag and cannot be sold, tossed, or given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to Pokémon Contest Halls. Without this item, receptionists will refuse entry into the various contest ranks (Normal, Super, Hyper, and Master).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on Trainer-vs-Trainer battles or the Smogon/VGC metagames. It is strictly for the Contest sub-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. Its presence is the "flag" that allows the player to interact with the Contest UI and NPCs. In the context of the Hoenn region, it is the gateway to earning Contest Ribbons for a Pokémon's profile.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald:** Obtained at the Contest Hall in **Slateport City** (or Lilycove City in some versions) from a receptionist or NPC.
    * **Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire:** Received from **Lisia** in Slateport City after the player's first encounter with her near the Contest Spectacular Hall.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-time-per-save-file item.
* **Lore context:** The Contest Pass represents a Trainer's transition from a standard combatant to a "Coordinator," emphasizing the aesthetic and tactical appeal of moves rather than their raw damage output.
