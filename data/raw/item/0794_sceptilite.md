## Identity & Utility
**Sceptilite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, though the provided data highlights its presence in Generation VII).
* **Description:** One of a variety of mysterious Mega Stones. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is not consumed upon use. It is **not for sale** in standard Marts and cannot be used from the bag; it must be held by a specific Pokémon to function during battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). As a Key-tier held item, it cannot be bought or sold for currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Sceptile**, this stone allows it to undergo **Mega Evolution** during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Bracelet or Mega Ring. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Transformation:** Upon Mega Evolution, Sceptile becomes **Mega Sceptile**, gaining the **Grass/Dragon** dual typing and the **Lightning Rod** ability (which grants immunity to Electric-type moves and boosts Special Attack when hit by one).
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Moderate damage; however, flinging a Mega Stone is generally tactically disadvantageous as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for Sceptile. In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (like Smogon's NatDex or Gen 6/7 VGC), it is mandatory for Sceptile to reach its maximum offensive potential, particularly as a high-speed Special Attacker.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger permanent evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Mega Evolution** mechanic. It cannot be removed via *Thief*, *Knock Off*, or *Covet* if held by the correct Pokémon, and it is unaffected by the ability *Klutz*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Sceptilite is typically obtained through special story events or post-game challenges. In its debut (ORAS), it is given by Steven Stone or purchased at the Route 114 Stone Salesman. In Generation VII (per the JSON context), it is acquired via the **Battle Tree** in Alola or through special distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact that cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
