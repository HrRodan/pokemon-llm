## Identity & Utility
**Mega-glasses** is a **Key Item** (specifically a Key Stone variant) documented in **Generation VII**, though its narrative origins trace back to the Hoenn remakes.
* **Description:** These specialized glasses function as a housing for a Key Stone. They possess the power to resonate with a Pokémon's Mega Stone, enabling Mega Evolution during battle. It is an **Unobtainable Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by the player's Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique NPC Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Theoretically enables **Mega Evolution**. However, within the game code, this specific item is flagged as "Unused" for the player. It serves as a narrative and visual tool rather than a functional inventory item for the protagonist.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As an unobtainable NPC item, it has no presence in VGC, Smogon, or standard ladder play. The player uses the *Mega Ring*, *Mega Bracelet*, or *Z-Ring* to achieve the same effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item acts as the **Key Stone** catalyst for **Maxie**, the leader of Team Magma. It allows his signature Pokémon (such as Camerupt) to undergo Mega Evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** While the item exists in the game's internal data (notably in *Omega Ruby*, *Alpha Sapphire*, *Sun*, and *Moon*), it is restricted to NPC use. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** In the Generation VI Hoenn games, major characters possess unique accessories to house their Key Stones (e.g., Archie’s Mega Anchor, Steven’s Mega Stickpin). The **Mega-glasses** are Maxie's specific aesthetic choice, reflecting his intellectual and calculating persona as the head of Team Magma. Despite being categorized under Generation VII in the metadata, it remains a legacy asset from the Gen VI Hoenn era.
