## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal OPH6056** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A rare, event-exclusive consumable item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. It is a single-use trigger item that cannot be purchased through conventional Poké Marts, serving as a gateway to specific Max Raid Battles.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; functionally "Not for sale" as it is a promotional distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Ruins (Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, a **Gigantamax Orbeetle**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. This encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the crystal has no utility during a competitive match, it is highly valued for the **acquisition** of competitive-grade Pokémon. These crystals often guarantee encounters with Pokémon possessing Hidden Abilities or specific Gigantamax forms that are otherwise rare or time-locked.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Power Spot** mechanics of the Watchtower Lair in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Code** promotions (often through retailers like GameStop, Micromania, or specialized event distributions). It is not available through gameplay progression or standard Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item designed to facilitate community engagement and event participation.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. Unlike the naturally occurring Wishing Pieces that summon random Pokémon from active dens, these specific "named" crystals (like OPH6056) are tuned to a specific frequency to summon a predetermined, powerful entity from the Max Lair.
