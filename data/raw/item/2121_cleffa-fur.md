## Identity & Utility
**Cleffa Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of soft, fine fur shed by Cleffa. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various TMs. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any tactical advantage.
* **Cost:** 25 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary economic value lies in its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use as a "currency" for move-learning items.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines. In the Paldea and Kitakami regions, players must combine Cleffa Fur with League Points to manufacture moves associated with the Cleffa evolutionary line (typically Fairy-type or status-based moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a resource management item used in the "Teambuilding" phase rather than the "Battle" phase. It is essential for competitive players to secure enough Cleffa Fur to craft optimal movesets for their roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution itself, it is harvested from the **Cleffa** evolutionary line (Cleffa, Clefairy, Clefable). It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Cleffa**, **Clefairy**, or **Clefable**. It is also a potential reward from Tera Raid Battles featuring these Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is a **drop item** added to the inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter. In the Land of Kitakami, Cleffa Fur is most efficiently gathered via the "Let's Go!" auto-battle mechanic in areas where Cleffa and its evolutions congregate.
* **Lore Context:** The fur is known for its mystical properties and softness, reflecting the extraterrestrial and moon-reliant nature of the Pokémon from which it originates. Resource managers should note that Cleffa Fur is a tier-one material required for high-value Fairy-type utility moves.
