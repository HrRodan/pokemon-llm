## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGE7479** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used within Pokémon Sword and Shield. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts, despite its nominal internal cost.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this is a placeholder value for a promotional distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to spawn a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon. This encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/caught.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate a Max Raid Battle encounter in the overworld and has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (SGE7479) is part of a series of promotional codes (such as those distributed through retail partnerships like GameStop or Best Buy). It typically grants access to a rare encounter, such as a **Gigantamax Centiskorch** or **Gigantamax Copperajah**, which may not be easily accessible in the base game's standard raid rotations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Code/Mystery Gift** during special promotional periods. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which can be purchased with Watts to spawn random raids, Dynamax Crystals are fixed-encounter items.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a digital-only distribution item tied to real-world events or pre-order bonuses.
