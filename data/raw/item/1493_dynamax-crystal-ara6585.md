## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ara6585)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event-specific Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a special consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Wild Area. Once used, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Dynamax boss until the end of the current day. It is a single-use event item that is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a defined internal cost, these items are functionally **Priceless** as they cannot be purchased in standard Poké Marts and are typically acquired through serial code distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area while holding this item, it activates a Max Raid Battle. The specific Pokémon summoned is determined by the crystal's ID (in this case, the internal designation **ara6585**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in Trainer battles or competitive ladders. Its value lies entirely in the **PvE (Player vs. Environment)** acquisition of rare Pokémon, often featuring Hidden Abilities or high IV spreads.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Max Raid Battle mechanic unique to *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Distribution Only.** Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed via physical serial code cards at retailers (such as GameStop, Best Buy, or GAME) or through special promotional tie-ins (such as the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* Dual Pack or movie ticket pre-orders).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a strictly digital distribution item.
* **Context:** The "ara" prefix in the internal name typically refers to a specific promotional encounter. These crystals allowed players to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive (e.g., Larvitar in *Sword* or Jangmo-o in *Shield*) or to access raids at a guaranteed location without relying on the standard "Wishing Piece" RNG.
