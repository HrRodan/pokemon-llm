## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CET681)** is a specialized event-related item categorized under **Dynamax Crystals**, introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a consumable utility item designed for use at a specific location: the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (indicated by internal ID CET681). It is a **Consumable** item that is functionally treated as a special acquisition, though it possesses a technical internal price.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Technical price; typically distributed via promotional serial codes rather than standard Mart menus).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held in battle and has no effect on competitive matchmaking. Its value lies entirely in the "overworld" mechanics of the Galar region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic and the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It is a key tool for collectors looking to obtain Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax potential, depending on the specific encounter data assigned to the crystal.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are generally not available through standard gameplay. They were primarily distributed through **mystery gift codes**, retail promotions (such as those from GameStop or Target), or as bonuses for purchasing specific DLC or strategy guides.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a promotional or event-based resource meant to bridge the gap between real-world events and in-game encounters.
