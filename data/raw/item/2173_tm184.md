## Identity & Utility
**TM184** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use data disc used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX ecosystem, TMs are consumable but can be replicated at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **800 LP** and specific materials like **Chimchar Fur** to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Vacuum Wave** to a compatible Pokémon.
    * **Move Profile:** Vacuum Wave is a Fighting-type Special move with a base power of 40 and a **Priority of +1**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be Flung in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Situational / Strategic.** Vacuum Wave is one of the very few special priority moves in the game. It is essential for special-attacking Fighting types (like **Lucario** or **Iron Valiant**) and other special attackers (like **Keldeo** or **Blastoise**) to pick off weakened, faster opponents or bypass "Sucker Punch" users.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching tool.

## Acquisition & Lore

* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM, trainers typically need:
    1. **800 LP**
    2. **Chimchar Fur** (x3)
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It must be found as a collectible item ball in the overworld or crafted.
