## Identity & Utility
**Audinite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, though documented here in its Generation VII context).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized evolutionary stone that reacts with a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **not for sale** in traditional Poké Marts. When held by an Audino, it allows the Pokémon to transcend its normal limits through Mega Evolution.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Like all Mega Stones, it cannot be bought with standard currency and is usually obtained through exploration, NPCs, or Battle Point (BP) exchanges.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by an Audino, it enables **Mega Evolution**. Upon activation in battle, Audino transforms into **Mega Audino**, gaining the **Fairy type** (becoming Normal/Fairy) and the **Healer** ability, while receiving significant boosts to its Defense and Special Defense stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (While it can be used with Fling, doing so is counter-productive as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Bulky Support.** Mega Audino is primarily utilized as a "cleric" in lower competitive tiers (like NU or PU). Its high bulk and access to Wish, Heal Bell, and Knock Off make it a formidable tank, though it is often overlooked because it consumes the team's single Mega Evolution slot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Audino. It does not disappear after use and cannot be removed by moves like *Trick* or *Thief* if held by the correct species. It is ignored by the ability *Klutz* in the context of preventing Mega Evolution, though the Pokémon must still be capable of evolving.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually tied to post-game content or specific NPC interactions. 
    * In **ORAS**, it is gifted by Looker at the Battle Resort. 
    * In **Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon**, it is obtained at the **Battle Tree** for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item that must be found in the overworld or earned through battle challenges. Unlike common items, it cannot be farmed using the **Pickup** ability.
