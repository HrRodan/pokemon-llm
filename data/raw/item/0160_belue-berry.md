## Identity & Utility
**Belue Berry** is a **Baking-Only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A large, glossy berry that is notably soft despite its size. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be bought for a nominal fee, though it is primarily grown or received as a gift. It lacks any direct restorative or status-curing properties, functioning purely as a crafting component for Pokémon Contests.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively for creating **Pokéblocks** (Hoenn) and **Poffins** (Sinnoh). It is highly valued for raising Pokémon Contest conditions, specifically the **Beauty** (Sour) or **Cool** (Spicy) attributes depending on the game's cooking mechanics.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When held and consumed via the move Natural Gift, it produces a **Steel-type** attack with a high **Base Power of 100** (Gen IV+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it provides no passive benefit when held and occupies an item slot that could be used for tactical advantage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolutions. It is purely an aesthetic-progression item for the Contest circuit.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region (Hoenn), it is rarely found in the wild and is most famously obtained from the **Berry Master’s Wife** by telling her the specific phrase "OVERWHELMING LATIAS." In Sinnoh, it can be found on specific late-game routes (e.g., Route 211) or purchased at the Pal Park.
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is not typically held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through cultivation in loamy soil or via NPC gifts.
* **Lore context:** Known as the "Extra Large" berry, its flavor is a complex mix of sour and spicy, making it a favorite for trainers aiming to win Master Rank Beauty Contests.
