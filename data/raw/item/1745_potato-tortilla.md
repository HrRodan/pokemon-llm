## Identity & Utility
**Potato-tortilla** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A culinary component used specifically in the Paldean Picnic mechanic. It is a consumable ingredient utilized to craft custom sandwiches that grant various "Meal Powers." It is a staple ingredient that can be bought in bulk for casual and competitive shiny hunting or breeding.
* **Cost:** 250 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, it contributes to the final Meal Power values. Specifically, it provides a high boost to **Humungo Power** and **Encounter Power**, while influencing flavors (primarily Salty and Sour).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle; it is stored in the Ingredients bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** Not used in direct trainer battles. Its value lies in **Metagame Preparation**, such as increasing the spawn rate of specific types (Encounter Power) or facilitating the search for "Marked" or "Shiny" Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts solely with the **Picnic/Sandwich-making** mini-game.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at food-specific retail outlets throughout the Paldea region. It is most commonly purchased at **Aquiresta**, **Sure Cans**, and **Daily Ice** stands after the player has obtained a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, this is a processed human food item intended for trainer-led meal preparation. Generally gathered through currency-based transactions rather than the **Pickup** ability.
