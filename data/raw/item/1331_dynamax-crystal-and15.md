## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AND15** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, event-exclusive consumable item designed to facilitate specific Max Raid Battles. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to spawn. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this is a placeholder value as the item is typically acquired via external serial codes rather than in-game shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), this crystal triggers a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight). In the case of the **AND15** variant, it specifically targets the Pokémon **Duraludon**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no effect via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used solely for facilitating raids. However, it is valuable to competitive players for farming high-IV specimens, specific Natures, or Hidden Abilities for Duraludon/Archaludon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through natural exploration or Marts. It was primarily distributed as a **Promotional Bonus** (such as serial codes provided with the purchase of the *Pokémon Sword and Shield* Expansion Pass or through specific retail partnerships). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a "Special Acquisition" item intended for one-time use per crystal.
* **World Knowledge:** The "AND" series of Dynamax Crystals (like AND15, AND33, etc.) were internal designations for specific event encounters. These crystals allowed players to bypass the RNG of standard Den spawns to guarantee a battle with rare or version-exclusive Pokémon.
