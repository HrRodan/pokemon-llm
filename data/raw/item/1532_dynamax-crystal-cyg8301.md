## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Cyg8301)** is a **Special Event Item / Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized consumable item designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, the crystal remains active until the end of the day or until the raid is completed.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; this cost is a placeholder value as the item is distributed via special serial codes and cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone den in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Gigantamax Pokémon—specifically **Gigantamax Corviknight**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle encounter.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no use in a competitive battle, it is functionally essential for acquiring a Pokémon with the Gigantamax Factor and potentially Hidden Abilities for use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in the Galar region. It does not evolve Pokémon, but it is the only way to "force" a specific raid encounter outside of standard den resets or Wishing Pieces.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (Cyg8301) was typically distributed via **serial codes** through promotional partners (such as CoroCoro or retail distributions) for Pokémon Sword and Shield. It is a one-time-use item that disappears from the bag after the raid is successfully triggered.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a specialized event trigger, similar to an "Eon Ticket" or "Member Card" from previous generations, though it functions as a consumable rather than a permanent Key Item.
