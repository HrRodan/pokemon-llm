## Identity & Utility
**Love Ball** is a **Specialty Poké Ball (Apricorn Ball)** introduced in Generation II (Johto) and reintroduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** A specialized capture device crafted from **Pink Apricorns**. It is designed specifically for catching wild Pokémon that are the opposite gender of the trainer's active Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that is **not available for standard purchase** in Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). It cannot be bought; it must be crafted by an artisan or obtained through special events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In battle, it functions as a Poké Ball with a situational catch rate modifier. If the player's active Pokémon and the wild Pokémon are of the **same species** but **opposite genders**, the catch rate is multiplied by **8×**. If these conditions are not met, it functions as a standard Poké Ball (1× catch rate).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls generally cannot be used with the move Fling for damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no mechanical advantage in competitive battling, the Love Ball is highly coveted in the **"Aestheti-competitive"** and breeding communities. Its distinct heart-themed particle effect upon entry makes it a "status symbol" for specific Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Since Generation VI, the type of Poké Ball used to catch a female Pokémon (and later males/genderless via Ditto) can be **passed down through breeding**. This has made the Love Ball a primary target for "Aura" and "Ball-matching" collectors.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically crafted by **Kurt in Azalea Town** (Johto region) using Pink Apricorns. In modern titles (Gen VII-IX), it is often a rare reward from the Ace Academy Tournament, Porto Marinada auctions, or specific Pokédex completion milestones.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its scarcity is tied to its status as a "Rare Ball" or "Apriball."
* **Lore context:** The Love Ball is the pinnacle of niche capture technology; while its 8× multiplier is one of the highest in the franchise, the requirement for matching the species makes it significantly harder to utilize than a Dusk Ball or Ultra Ball, cementing its role as a specialist tool for dedicated trackers.
