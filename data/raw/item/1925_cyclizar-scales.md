## Identity & Utility
**Cyclizar Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** These are scales shed by the Mount Pokémon, Cyclizar. Within the Paldea region's ecosystem, they serve as a biological resource used for crafting Technical Machines. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for 120 Pokémon Dollars or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Material Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The scales are used as a specialized currency at the **Technical Machine Machine (TMM)** found at Pokémon Centers. They are a required ingredient for synthesizing specific TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling and has no in-battle effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the "Preparation Phase" of competitive play, enabling the player to teach essential moves to their team via TM crafting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** These scales are required to craft high-value TMs, most notably:
    * **TM014 (Acrobatics)**
    * **TM152 (Giga Impact)**
    * **TM156 (Outrage)**
    * **TM166 (Thunderbolt)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching a wild **Cyclizar**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "Held Item," these scales are categorized as a species-specific drop. Cyclizar are frequently found in the **West Province (Area Two)** and **East Province (Area Two)** of Paldea, often seen sprinting across paths.
* **Lore Context:** In the Paldean region, the use of "Pokemon Materials" like Cyclizar Scales represents a technological shift in how moves are taught, moving away from infinite-use TMs or rare single-use discs to a system based on ecological collection and synthesis.
