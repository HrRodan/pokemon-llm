## Identity & Utility
**Rm-2-Key** (Room 2 Key) is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** An old, fragile-looking key specifically designed to unlock the door to Room 2 within the **Abandoned Ship** (known as **Sea Mauville** in later iterations). It is a **Key Item** that is critical for environmental progression and cannot be sold or traded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When in the player's inventory, interacting with the locked door of Room 2 on the Abandoned Ship will consume the item's "locked" status (effectively unlocking the door permanently). This allows the player to access the items and trainers inside.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for overworld progression and puzzle-solving during the main story or post-game exploration.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It is part of a sequential "Key Hunt" puzzle where finding one key typically leads to the discovery of the next (e.g., Room 1 Key -> Room 2 Key -> Room 4 Key).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the **Abandoned Ship** on Route 108 in the original Hoenn games (*Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald*). In the remakes (*Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*), it is located within **Sea Mauville**. It is typically found by searching sparkling spots on the floor or inside storage containers within other accessible rooms on the ship.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique quest item that must be found through exploration.
* **Context:** The Abandoned Ship/Sea Mauville serves as a complex side-quest location. The Room 2 Key is a mid-step in navigating the ship's interior to eventually recover the **Scanner**, which can be traded for the Deep Sea Tooth or Deep Sea Scale (items required to evolve Clamperl).
