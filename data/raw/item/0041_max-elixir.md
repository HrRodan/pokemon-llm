## Identity & Utility
**Max Elixir** is a **PP-Recovery Medicine** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A high-tier medicinal spray or drink that fully restores the Power Points (PP) of every move known by a single Pokémon. It is a **consumable** item that is usable both during battle and in the overworld. While it has a high internal cost, it is historically categorized as a "rare find" rather than a standard store-bought commodity.
* **Cost:** 4500 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Special Acquisition**). In most core series games, this item cannot be purchased in standard Poké Marts, making its 4,500 value primarily relevant for its high sell price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it restores the PP of **all four moves** to their maximum capacity. It is the most powerful variant of the PP-recovery line, succeeding the Ether (10 PP to one move), Max Ether (Full PP to one move), and Elixir (10 PP to all moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough & Nuzlocke Essential.** Because PP does not naturally restore between fights in the overworld, the Max Elixir is a critical resource for the Elite Four or long dungeons. It is **prohibited** in standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon) as consumables are generally disallowed or impractical for short-form matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. While it can be "held" by a Pokémon, it has no passive effect in battle; it must be manually used by the trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a "treasure" item in late-game locations, such as Victory Road or Team Hideouts. It is frequently hidden and requires the **Itemfinder** or **Dowsing Machine** to locate. In some titles, it can be obtained via the **Cram-o-matic** or as a high-tier reward in Battle Facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held** by wild Pokémon. In many generations, it can only be farmed repeatedly through the **Pickup** ability, usually by high-level Pokémon (typically Level 71–100 depending on the game), reinforcing its status as a rare and valuable resource.
