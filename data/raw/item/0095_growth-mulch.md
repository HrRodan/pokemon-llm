## Identity & Utility
**Growth Mulch** is a specialized **Mulch** (Horticulture Item) introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer used on soft soil patches before planting a Berry. It acts as an accelerant for the plant's biological cycle. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at dedicated berry-related shops.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a patch of loamy soil, the time required for each growth stage of the planted Berry is **reduced by 25%**. 
* **Secondary Mechanic:** The acceleration comes at the cost of hydration; the soil **dries out more quickly** than normal, requiring more frequent watering from the player to ensure a high yield.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a pure utility item used in the overworld for resource farming. It has no viable application in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Berry Growing** mechanic. Note that in certain later generations (like Sun/Moon), flavor text indicates it is "unsuitable" for those regions' soil, effectively rendering it a legacy item in those specific contexts.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily sold at the **Flower Shop** in Floaroma Town or by the **Berry Master’s wife** on Route 208 in the Sinnoh region. In Generation V, it can be purchased at the Join Avenue Flower Shop.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically manufactured and sold as a commercial tool for trainers looking to mass-produce Berries for competitive battles (e.g., harvesting Lum or Sitrus Berries) or Pokéblock/Poffin making.
* **Lore Context:** Growth Mulch is part of a four-tier mulch system (Growth, Damp, Stable, Gooey) designed to allow trainers to customize their "farming" strategy based on how often they can check their game. Growth Mulch is the preferred choice for active players who can water their plants frequently in exchange for faster results.
