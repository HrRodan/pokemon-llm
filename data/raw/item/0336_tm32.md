## Identity & Utility
**TM32** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation I** (historically associated with the Hoenn region in the provided metadata).
* **Description:** A teaching tool used to provide a Pokémon with a specific move it cannot learn through leveling up. While historically identifying as the move **Double Team**, the specific flavor text in this data corresponds to the Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) iteration where it teaches **Sandstorm**. It is a **Consumable/Multi-use** item (depending on the specific game version) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Double Team** (or **Sandstorm** in specific iterations like Sword/Shield) to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * *Double Team:* Raises the user's Evasiveness stat by one stage.
    * *Sandstorm:* Summons a sandstorm for five turns, damaging non-Rock, Ground, or Steel types and boosting the Special Defense of Rock types by 50%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs typically cannot be used with the move Fling, or have no base power/secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Double Team:** Historically controversial; it is banned under the "Evasion Clause" in most standard competitive formats (Smogon) because it relies on RNG/luck. It is a staple for "stalling" strategies in casual play and Battle Facilities.
        * **Sandstorm:** A core component of "Sand Teams," essential for activating abilities like Sand Rush, Sand Force, or Sand Veil.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, as Double Team and Sandstorm are "universal" moves with high distribution across many types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase in large Department Stores (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove) or the Battle Frontier/Battle Tower. The 10,000 price point reflects its status as a mid-to-high-tier tactical move. In older generations, TM32 was famously the prize at the **Rocket Game Corner**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In recent generations, TMs are either infinite-use or must be crafted using materials gathered from the overworld.
