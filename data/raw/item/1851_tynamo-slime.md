## Identity & Utility
**Tynamo Slime** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting resource dropped by members of the Tynamo evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at the TM Machine. It is not a held item and provides no direct benefit in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common Resource**). While it can be sold for 80 Poké Dollars, its primary value is as a secondary currency (League Points + Materials) for move teaching.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the **Technical Machine Machine (TMM)** to craft specific Technical Machines. It represents the essence of the Tynamo line's biological traits, typically used for Electric-type or physical-contact moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; its value is entirely pedagogical, allowing players to customize Pokémon movesets during the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component for the TM system introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Tynamo family (**Tynamo, Eelektrik, or Eelektross**). It can also be obtained through the Pokémon Wash mechanic or as a random sparkling pickup in biomes where these Pokémon reside.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a **guaranteed drop** upon the defeat of wild **Tynamo** (often found in the caves and waters of Paldea). 
* **Lore Context:** The slime is characteristic of Tynamo's slick, eel-like body, which allows it to conduct electricity and move through water with minimal friction. In-game, this material is most notably required to craft **TM147 (Wild Charge)** and other high-voltage Electric-type Technical Machines.
