## Identity & Utility
**Nugget** is a **Loot** item introduced in the early generations (standardized in Generation IV metadata).
* **Description:** A nugget of the purest gold that gives off a lustrous gleam. It is a high-value **Consumable (Vendor Trash)** item that cannot be bought from standard shops but serves as a primary source of income for trainers.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High Value**). While its internal cost is listed at 10,000, its primary purpose is being sold for 5,000 Poké Dollars (standard) or higher to specialists.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Nugget has no functional use in battle or the overworld other than being sold. It can be sold for **5,000 Poké Dollars** at any Poke Mart, or for a premium price of **10,000 Poké Dollars** when sold to specialized NPCs like the Ore Collector (found in regions like Unova or Sinnoh).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is "Vendor Trash" and provides no tactical advantage in competitive play (Smogon or VGC). Holding it in battle is generally considered a mistake unless attempting to use the move *Switcheroo* or *Trick* to burden an opponent with a useless item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. However, it is a frequent reward for completing the "Nugget Bridge" challenge in Kanto or found via the **Pickup** ability at higher levels.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as a hidden item (using the Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine) or as a reward for defeating specific trainers. It is famously associated with the Team Rocket recruitment drive at the Nugget Bridge in Cerulean City.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Meowth**, **Grimer**, **Muk**, **Trubbish**, and **Garbodor**. Trainers often farm Nuggets by using the **Pickup** ability or by using moves like **Thief** and **Covet** on these specific species (particularly Meowth, which is lore-accurate due to its obsession with shiny objects).
