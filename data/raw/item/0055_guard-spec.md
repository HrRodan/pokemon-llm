## Identity & Utility
**Guard Spec.** is a **Stat-Boost** item introduced in the early generations of the franchise (referenced here via **Generation IV** metadata).
* **Description:** An specialized battle enhancer used to shield a Pokémon's current condition. It is a **Consumable** item that is **Usable-in-battle** but provides no passive benefit if held by a Pokémon. While the data lists it as "holdable," it is designed to be used by the Trainer from the bag.
* **Cost:** 1,500 Poké Dollars (**Moderate price/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in battle, it prevents the stats of the Pokémon on the player's side from being lowered by the opponent for **five turns**. This effect mimics the move *Mist*. Additionally, using the item increases the Pokémon's happiness (Friendship) by a small margin (1/1/0 scale).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough Only.** In official VGC and Smogon formats, players cannot use items from their bag during a match. Therefore, its utility is restricted to the main story or Nuzlocke challenges, specifically against opponents who rely on Intimidate or moves like Leer and Growl.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "X Item" family of battle-only consumables, though it focuses on protection rather than a direct stat increase.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in the **Department Stores** of major regions (such as the Veilstone Department Store in Sinnoh or the Lilycove Department Store in Hoenn). It is a staple item for Trainers preparing for major Gym Leader or Elite Four battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or defensive items like Leftovers, this is a manufactured chemical spray that must be purchased or found as floor loot (Poké Balls) in the overworld. It is a common find in industrial or urban areas within the games.
