## Identity & Utility
**Kelpsy Berry** is a **Consumable EV-Reduction Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Berry used to fine-tune a Pokémon's stats and emotional bond. It makes a Pokémon more friendly while simultaneously lowering its Attack Effort Values (EVs). It is a consumable item that is primarily used from the bag but can be held in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While often found in the wild, its low price reflects its status as a common agricultural commodity in the Pokémon world.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon, it **lowers Attack Effort Values (EVs) by 10** and **increases Happiness/Friendship**. The happiness boost scales based on current friendship levels: +10 (0-99), +5 (100-199), or +2 (200-255). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Natural Gift:** When held, it allows the move Natural Gift to become a **Fighting-type** attack with **90 Power** (mechanic varies by generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** A vital tool for **EV Resets and Optimization**. It is frequently used by competitive players to remove unwanted Attack EVs from Special Attackers to minimize damage taken from the move *Foul Play* or self-inflicted confusion damage. It is also essential for clearing accidentally gained EVs during leveling.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Used to accelerate **Friendship-based Evolutions** (e.g., Eevee to Sylveon/Espeon/Umbreon, Riolu to Lucario) without the risk of leveling up past a certain point.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found on **Berry Trees** throughout the Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, and Alola regions. In later generations (like Sword/Shield or Scarlet/Violet), they are often found as sparkles on the ground in specific wild areas or purchased from specialized Berry merchants.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon; it is primarily obtained through cultivation or foraging in the overworld.
* **Lore Context:** Known for its vibrant blue color and unique shape, it is part of a cycle of six berries (Pomeg, Kelpsy, Qualot, Hondew, Grepa, Tamato) used by trainers to "re-train" a Pokémon's fundamental strengths.
