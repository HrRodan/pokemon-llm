## Identity & Utility
**TM217** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*).
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding device used to teach the move **Agility** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike early generations, this is a permanent-use item that is not consumed upon use, though it must be crafted or found within the Terarium.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the Paldean ecosystem, TMs are acquired through exploration or produced at a **TM Machine** using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Agility** (Psychic-type, Status).
    * **Move Detail:** Agility sharply raises the user’s **Speed stat by two stages (+2)**. This effectively doubles the Pokémon's speed, allowing it to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be utilized effectively with the move Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** Agility is a cornerstone move for "Set-up Sweepers." It is frequently used on bulky attackers (like Metagross or Kingambit) or glass cannons that need to ensure they move first to sweep an opponent's team. It is a staple in both Singles (Smogon) and occasionally seen in VGC for speed control.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-learning tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item ball within the **Terarium** at Blueberry Academy. Specifically, it is located in the **Savanna Biome**.
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once obtained, it can be replicated at any TM Machine using the following resources:
    * **800 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Aipom Hair**
    * **3x Fletchling Feathers**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; however, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Aipom**, **Ambipom**, **Fletchling**, **Fletchinder**, and **Talonflame**.
