## Identity & Utility
**Darkinium Z (Held)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically attuned to Dark-type energy. When held by a Pokémon, it serves as a catalyst to upgrade standard Dark-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Held Item** (specifically a specialized mechanical tool) that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). As a Key Item-adjacent held item, it is unique and cannot be traded away or lost in battle.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder knows a Dark-type damaging move, this crystal allows the use of the Z-Move **Black Hole Eclipse**. The power and category (Physical or Special) of the Z-Move depend on the base move used. If the holder knows a Dark-type status move, it can be converted into a **Z-Status move**, adding secondary effects (e.g., *Z-Parting Shot* restores the HP of the replacement Pokémon, or *Z-Snatch* raises Speed by two stages).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are structurally unique; they **cannot be used with Fling**, and they cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen VII Meta).** In the Sun/Moon era, Darkinium Z was frequently used by offensive threats like **Ash-Greninja** or **Tyranitar** to bypass traditional checks with a high-damage "nuke." It was also used nichely on Pokémon like **Mandibuzz** or **Honchkrow** for specialized Z-Status move benefits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it interacts directly with the **Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring** Key Item held by the Trainer. It is unaffected by the ability *Klutz* (in terms of being removed) and cannot be suppressed by *Embargo* or *Magic Room*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is a story-significant item obtained during the **Island Challenge** in the Alola region. It is typically gifted to the player by the Kahuna of Ula'ula Island, **Nanu**, after completing his trial or defeating him in a Grand Trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact given only to trainers who have proven their worth in the Alolan rites of passage. It is essentially "farm-proof" and cannot be duplicated via the *Pickup* ability.
