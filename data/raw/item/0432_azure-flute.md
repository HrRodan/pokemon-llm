## Identity & Utility
**Azure Flute** is an **Event Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Described as a flute emitting otherworldly echoing sounds of unknown origin. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold. In the context of the game's internal logic, it is a unique artifact used to trigger a specific legendary encounter.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When played at the Spear Pillar in the Sinnoh region, it creates a staircase leading to the **Hall of Origin**, allowing the player to encounter the Mythical Pokémon **Arceus**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item exists solely for overworld event progression and has no function in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the specific trigger for the Arceus encounter. While technically "unreleased" during the original Nintendo DS era of *Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum* due to distribution being cancelled, it remains functional in the game's code and was officially implemented in the Gen VIII remakes (*Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, this is one of the most famous "lost items" in Pokémon history. It was never distributed via Mystery Gift in Generation IV. In the Nintendo Switch era, it is obtained in *Brilliant Diamond* or *Shining Pearl* by having a completed save file of *Pokémon Legends: Arceus* on the same console and visiting the player’s bedroom.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon; it is an event-exclusive Key Item obtained through special circumstances or save-data bonuses.
