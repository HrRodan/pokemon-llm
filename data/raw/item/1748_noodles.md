## Identity & Utility
**Noodles** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A culinary component used exclusively in the **Picnic** mechanic for crafting sandwiches. It serves as a bulk ingredient that influences the "Meal Powers" granted to the player. It is a **Consumable** item that is readily available for purchase in specialized food shops.
* **Cost:** 280 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in sandwich making, Noodles contribute specific flavor profiles—primarily **Salty**, **Bitter**, and **Sour**. These flavors combine with other ingredients to determine the resulting **Meal Power** (e.g., Encounter Power, Catching Power, or Egg Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Noodles are categorized as sandwich ingredients and cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle; therefore, they cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held or used during a battle. Its value is strictly relegated to "pre-game" preparation and world exploration.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Picnic system** and the **Meal Power mechanics** rather than specific Pokémon abilities or forms.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at grocery outlets throughout the **Paldea region**, specifically at **Sure Cans**, **Aguilear Supermarket**, and **Deli Cioso** locations. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or traditional held items, it is an industrial food product obtained through Paldean commerce. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
