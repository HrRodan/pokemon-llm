## Identity & Utility
**Ice Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized fragment containing the essence of the Ice type. It is a **Consumable Crafting/Service Material** that cannot be purchased from standard Poké Marts but can be sold. It is used exclusively to manipulate the Terastal phenomenon in Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap resale value; primarily an earned resource rather than a commercial commodity).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a trainer accumulates **50 Ice Tera Shards**, they can be exchanged at the Treasure Eatery in Medali to change a Pokémon’s **Tera Type** to **Ice**. This consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in active combat).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Defining Utility.** Changing a Pokémon's Tera Type is the central mechanic of Generation IX competitive play (VGC/Smogon). While Ice is traditionally a weak defensive type, an Ice Tera Type is used offensively to grant a **2x STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** to Ice-type moves like *Blizzard* or *Icicle Spear*, or defensively to grant resistance to Ice-type attacks in specific niche weather compositions (e.g., Snow teams).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the Terastal mechanic via the Chef NPC in Medali.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily sourced as rewards from **Tera Raid Battles** (specifically Ice-type raids of 3-stars or higher). Large quantities can also be obtained through the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy (Indigo Disk DLC) or as rare "sparkling" overworld drops in cold climates like **Glaseado Mountain**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, these are environmental fragments of the Great Crater’s energy, gathered through Raids rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
