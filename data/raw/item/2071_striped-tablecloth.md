## Identity & Utility
**Striped-tablecloth** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the appearance of the player's picnic table while exploring the Paldea region. It is a **Cosmetic Customization** item that is held in the inventory and can be toggled at any time during a picnic. It is readily **available for purchase**.
* **Cost:** 1,500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player sets up a **Picnic**, they can interact with the table to change its appearance. Selecting the Striped-tablecloth applies a striped pattern to the table surface. This effect is purely aesthetic and provides no mechanical bonuses to Sandwich-making or Meal Powers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is an overworld-only cosmetic item intended for the "Picnic" social and breeding mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on Pokémon evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it is stored in the "Main Items" or "Picnic Item" pocket rather than being a holdable item for Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is sold at **Picnic Knacks** specialty stores found in major Paldean hubs, such as **Mesagoza**, **Cascarrafa**, and **Levincia**. It is one of many collectible patterns available to trainers looking to personalize their camping experience.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a retail product obtained through Mart-style vendors.
