## Identity & Utility
**Vullaby Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Vullaby evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any effect.
* **Cost:** 35 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Mass-produced material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine to craft specific TMs. It represents the essence of the Pokémon’s moveset (typically Flying or Dark-type moves).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be Flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. Specifically, it is required to craft moves such as **TM070 (Sleep Talk)**, **TM113 (Tailwind)**, and **TM164 (Brave Bird)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Vullaby** or **Mandibuzz**.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is automatically added to the player's inventory upon the defeat of the Vullaby line. It is commonly farmed in arid or rocky areas where these Pokémon roost, such as the North Province or through Tera Raid Battles. Consistent with other avian materials, it is often gathered in bulk for high-level Flying-type move synthesis.
