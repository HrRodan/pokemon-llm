## Identity & Utility
**TR38 (Trick)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Trick** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use. The move allows the user to catch the target off guard and swap held items.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible). In its debut region (Galar), it is most commonly traded for **Watts** at Wild Area Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the Psychic-type move **Trick**. When used in battle, the user and the target exchange their held items. This fails if neither Pokémon is holding an item, or if one of the items is a Mega Stone, Z-Crystal, or specific Forme-changing item (like Zacian's Rusted Sword).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; TRs are rarely used as projectiles).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility.** Trick is a staple in competitive play (Smogon and VGC). It is primarily used by "Trick-Choice" sets, where a fast Pokémon holding a Choice Scarf or Choice Specs swaps it onto a defensive wall, effectively crippling that opponent by locking them into a single move. It is also used to steal beneficial items like Leftovers or Eviolite.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts significantly with the **Klutz** ability (allowing a Pokémon to swap an item it cannot otherwise use) and the **Sticky Hold** ability (which prevents the item from being swapped).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found primarily in the **Galar region**. It can be obtained by defeating Psychic-type Pokémon in Max Raid Battles or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a fluctuating price (typically 2,000–8,000 Watts depending on the day).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. This item is an artificial data disc created for training specific tactical maneuvers that were previously restricted to TMs or Move Tutors in earlier generations.
