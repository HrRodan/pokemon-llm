## Identity & Utility
**Shroodle Ink** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation 9** (Paldea).
* **Description:** A specialized material dropped by members of the Shroodle evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a Technical Machine Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a crafting reagent. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players take Shroodle Ink to the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers to create specific Technical Machines (TMs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely within the crafting economy and has no tactical application in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a direct byproduct of the **Shroodle** and **Grafaiai** line. It is used to craft TMs such as **TM029 (Charm)**, **TM071 (Chilling Water)**, and **TM102 (Gunk Shot)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the Paldea region. It is not purchased from standard Poké Marts but is acquired through field exploration and battling.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon but is a **guaranteed drop** upon defeating or catching wild **Shroodle** or **Grafaiai**. It is most efficiently farmed using the "Let's Go" Auto-Battle mechanic in areas where Shroodle are abundant, such as the Tagtree Thicket.
