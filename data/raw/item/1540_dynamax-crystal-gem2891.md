## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2891** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event item used in the Wild Area of the Galar region. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Overworld** item that functions similarly to a Key Item but is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically has a nominal value, but is **not for sale** in standard Poké Marts; it is acquired via special distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Using this item at the Watchtower Lair causes a specific Pokémon (indicated by the crystal's ID) to appear as a Dynamax (or Gigantamax) opponent. This allows players to encounter rare Pokémon or those with Hidden Abilities outside of standard raid dens or RNG-dependent spawns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no effect in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no competitive battle utility, it is highly valued for **farming competitive-grade Pokémon**. It provides a guaranteed encounter with specific species often possessing Max IVs or Hidden Abilities required for VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed via **Serial Codes** or special promotions (such as those found in *CoroCoro Comic*, pre-order bonuses, or physical retail events like those at GameStop or Pokémon Centers). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly external distribution item meant to drive engagement with the Max Raid Battle feature.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals contain concentrated Dynamax energy, acting as a beacon to draw specific powerful entities to the ancient ruins of the Watchtower.
