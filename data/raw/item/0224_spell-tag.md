## Identity & Utility
**Spell Tag** is a **Competitive Held Item (Type-Enhancement)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** An eerie, sinister paper charm to be held by a Pokémon. It functions as a specialized damage multiplier that passively strengthens spectral energy. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be bought for a moderate price, though it is frequently acquired through exploration or thievery from wild Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Affordable).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the power of the holder's **Ghost-type moves** is increased by **20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** It serves as a niche alternative to the **Life Orb** or **Choice Specs**. While the 20% boost is lower than the Life Orb's 30%, the Spell Tag is preferred for Ghost-type attackers (like Gengar or Dragapult) that require a damage boost to hit specific OHKO/20HKO thresholds without the 10% HP recoil penalty or being locked into a single move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a static power-booster that is unaffected by the holder’s level or state, provided the move used is Ghost-type.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in "haunted" locations such as the Lost Tower (Sinnoh), Celestial Tower (Unova), or various cemeteries and ruins across the Pokémon world. In most modern titles, it can be purchased at specialized late-game shops or the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously associated with Ghost-type lineages. It can be farmed from wild **Haunter, Gengar, Misdreavus, Shuppet, Duskull,** and **Yamask**. 
* **Farming Tip:** Using a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability (to scout the item) and the move **Thief** or **Covet** is the most efficient way to acquire multiple Spell Tags from wild encounters.
