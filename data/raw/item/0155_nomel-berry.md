## Identity & Utility
**Nomel Berry** is a **Baking-only Ingredient** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A sour, yellow berry specifically used as a raw material for crafting Pokémon treats. In the Hoenn region, it is blended into **Pokéblocks**, while in Sinnoh, it is used to bake **Poffins**. It is a consumable, plantable item that can be bought or sold for a very low price.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Nomel Berry has no direct effect when consumed by a Pokémon in or out of battle. Its utility is strictly limited to **Pokémon Contests**, where it serves as a high-quality ingredient to increase a Pokémon’s **Beauty** condition (due to its flavor profile).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Dragon-type** move with **90 Base Power** (Gen V+) or 70 Base Power (Gen IV).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-existent.** Aside from a highly specific and rare "Natural Gift" surprise coverage in older formats, this item provides no tactical advantage in standard VGC or Smogon play. Its value is entirely tied to the "Contest" sub-game and completionist mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is a target for the ability **Harvest**, allowing a Pokémon to periodically regrow the berry if it was consumed via Natural Gift.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained via NPC gifts rather than shops. In Generation III, it is famously acquired from the **Berry Master’s Wife** on Route 123 by telling her the phrase "SURELY CURIOUS." In modern iterations (BDSP), it can be found in the **Amity Square** or purchased from the Berry Master.
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is **not held by any wild Pokémon** in the standard games. It must be cultivated by planting it in soft soil and watering it to increase the yield.
