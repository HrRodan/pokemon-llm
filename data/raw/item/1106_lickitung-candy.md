## Identity & Utility
**Lickitung Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this item is tailored specifically for the Lickitung evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Stat-Booster** that is technically purchasable, though it is rarely obtained through standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Lickitung family (Lickitung or Lickilicky), it increases **all six permanent stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point simultaneously. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)** rather than traditional Effort Values (EVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is foundational for optimizing stats in the *Let's Go* series' competitive meta (where AVs are permitted), but it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats from Generation VIII onwards, as the AV system was discontinued.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly affects **Lickitung** and its evolution **Lickilicky**. It serves as the most efficient way to maximize a Lickitung's potential without grinding for generic size-based candies (like Tough Candy or Quick Candy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for catching wild Lickitung or by transferring caught Lickitung to Professor Oak. It can also be found by walking with a Lickitung in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through the **Catch Combo** mechanic—frequently rewarded to trainers who successfully chain multiple Lickitung captures in a row (commonly found in the Cerulean Cave).
