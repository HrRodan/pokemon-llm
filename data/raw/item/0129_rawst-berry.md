## Identity & Utility
**Rawst Berry** is a **Consumable Medicine** (Berry) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A bitter-tasting berry that serves as a specialized status-recovery item. It is a **Holdable Consumable** that can be used manually from the Bag or triggered automatically in battle. It is widely accessible and can be bought or grown.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Cures the **Burn** status condition. When held by a Pokémon, it is consumed immediately upon being burned to restore the holder's status. When used from the Bag, it cures a party Pokémon's burn outside or during battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (The target is cured of its burn).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it deals **Grass-type** damage with a Base Power of 80 (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche**. While it specifically counters *Will-O-Wisp* or *Scald* burns, it is usually passed over for the **Lum Berry**, which cures any status condition. However, it may be used in specific formats where a trainer wants to preserve a Lum Berry for other threats or on physical attackers highly susceptible to the Attack-halving penalty of a burn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Interacts with the **Harvest** ability, allowing the Pokémon to potentially regain the berry at the end of the turn.
    * Triggers the **Cheek Pouch** ability, restoring HP in addition to curing the burn.
    * Does not trigger evolution for any known Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found commonly on berry trees and soft soil patches across most regions. It is a staple item in Berry-growing mechanics and is often sold at specialized Berry shops or the Pokémon League.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently held by wild Fire-type Pokémon, most notably **Vulpix**, **Growlithe**, **Magmar**, **Numel**, and **Darumaka** (5% chance). It can be easily farmed using moves like *Thief* or *Covet*.
* **Lore:** Its bitter skin is known in the Pokémon world to have cooling properties that neutralize the high heat of a magical or chemical burn.
