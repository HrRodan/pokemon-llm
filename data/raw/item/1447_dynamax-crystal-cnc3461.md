## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CnC3461)** is a **Special Event Item** (specifically a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. Unlike standard Max Raid dens, these crystals allow players to force a specific encounter regardless of the weather or natural den rotations.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**). While it has a internal price, it is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is primarily obtained through external distribution.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in Galar's Wild Area, it activates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon (encoded in the item ID). The encounter remains active until 11:59 PM on the day it is used or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the "Overworld" to facilitate catching rare Pokémon or those with Hidden Abilities/Gigantamax forms for competitive training.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via serial codes or special promotions (e.g., retail pre-orders, CoroCoro magazine distributions, or movie ticket bonuses). This specific variant (CnC3461) is associated with promotional distributions that allowed players to encounter rare or version-exclusive Pokémon early in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a strictly digital distribution item intended for the player's inventory to be used as a "key" to unlock a specific raid encounter.
