## Identity & Utility
**Enigmatic-card** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** A mysterious note containing a cryptic request for the player to visit a specific guest room in a motel located on Akala Island's Route 8. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the trigger for the **Ultra Beast (UB) Storyline** in the post-game of Pokémon Sun and Moon. Possessing this item allows the player to enter the motel room on Route 8 where the international police officer **Looker** and his superior **Anabel** are located.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for narrative progression and has no mechanical impact on Pokémon battles or stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the catalyst for the "UB Quest," leading to the eventual capture of several Ultra Beasts (such as Nihilego, Buzzwole/Pheromosa, etc.). It does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Enigmatic Card is obtained automatically during the post-game. After the player becomes the Alola Region Champion and exits their house, a "mysterious man" (Looker) will approach and hand it over.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **unique** and is never held by wild Pokémon. It cannot be generated via the **Pickup** ability or stolen using moves like Thief.
* **World Knowledge:** The card is a classic narrative device used by the International Police to recruit the player's help in investigating the fallout of the Aether Foundation incident. While it mentions an "Akala motel," it specifically refers to the **Roadside Motel** on Route 8.
