## Identity & Utility
**Mighty Candy L** is a **Vitamin** (specifically a Stat-Enhancing Candy) introduced in **Generation VII** (exclusively for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy used to permanently bolster a Pokémon's physical power. Unlike traditional vitamins that affect EVs, this item is part of the **AV (Awakened Value)** system. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used from the Bag on Pokémon that meet a specific experience threshold.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**; primarily obtained through gameplay loops rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon that is **Level 30 or higher**, it increases that Pokémon’s **Attack stat** by 1 point (Awakened Value). This bonus is independent of the standard Effort Value (EV) system found in other core series games.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held items are not present in the *Let's Go* series).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is critical for optimizing Pokémon within the *Let's Go* competitive ecosystem (where AVs can grant up to +200 in every stat), but it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats for other generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item belongs to a hierarchy of Mighty Candies (Mighty Candy S < Mighty Candy M < **Mighty Candy L** < Mighty Candy XL), with the "L" variant being the mid-to-high tier requirement for developing mid-level Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by transferring Pokémon to **Professor Oak** or as a reward for catching physical-attack-oriented Pokémon (e.g., the Machop or Mankey lines) in the wild. High "Catch Combos" significantly increase the drop rate of "L" sized candies.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In the *Let's Go* mechanics, items are rewarded upon a successful capture or via the **Pokémon Go** transfer system rather than being stripped from held slots. It is a staple for players looking to maximize the physical damage output of their team before facing the Elite Four or Master Trainers.
