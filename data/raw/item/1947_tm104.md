## Identity & Utility
**TM104 (Iron Defense)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current iteration in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specific Technical Machine that teaches the move **Iron Defense** to compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumable items that are produced using the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Scarlet/Violet*, it is acquired through the crafting system using 1,500 LP (League Points) and specific Pokémon materials (3x Bronzor Fragments and 3x Pineco Husks).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a compatible Pokémon, it permanently teaches the move **Iron Defense**. 
    * **Move Detail:** Iron Defense is a Steel-type status move that raises the user's Defense stat by two stages (+2).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling in recent generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** This TM is vital for defensive archetypes. It is the cornerstone of the "Iron Press" strategy, where a Pokémon uses Iron Defense to boost its physical bulk and then utilizes **Body Press** to deal massive damage based on that elevated Defense stat. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like Corviknight, Skarmory, Zamazenta, and Garganacl.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is a key component for setup sweepers and "walls" in both VGC (Doubles) and Smogon (Singles) formats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available primarily in the Paldea region and the Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk). It can be found as a collectible item in the overworld (notably in the East Province or Glaseado Mountain) or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine after defeating specific Team Star bosses or finding the TM in the wild.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required for its creation are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Bronzor**, **Bronzong**, **Pineco**, and **Forretress**.
