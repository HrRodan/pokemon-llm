## Identity & Utility
**Rare-candy** is a **Vitamin** (Consumable Medicine) introduced in **Generation IV** (as per current data, though present since Gen I).
* **Description:** A high-energy treat that grants an immediate level-up to a single Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that can be held by a Pokémon, though its primary utility is through overworld menu usage. While it has a defined price, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**; typically limited to special vendors or point-exchange shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it instantly increases a Pokémon's level by 1 (up to level 100). Additionally, it provides a minor boost to **Happiness/Friendship** (+5 for low friendship, scaling down to +2 for high friendship).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Staple.** While it has no tactical value as a held item in battle, it is the gold standard for efficient team preparation. In Nuzlocke challenges, it is the primary tool for bypassing "grinding." In modern generations (Gen VIII+), it can be used on a Level 100 Pokémon to trigger an evolution that normally requires a level-up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates evolution for any Pokémon with a level-based evolution requirement. It interacts with the **Pickup** ability table, serving as a high-tier reward.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally found as "Hidden Items" scattered across various regions, detectable via the Itemfinder or Dowsing Machine. It is a common high-tier prize in Battle Facilities (Battle Tower, Battle Maison, etc.) in exchange for BP (Battle Points).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly held by wild Pokémon. Its primary "organic" source in-game is the **Pickup** ability, where Pokémon in higher level brackets (typically Lv. 41+) have a 10% chance to generate one after a battle.
