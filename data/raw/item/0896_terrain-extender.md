## Identity & Utility
**Terrain Extender** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized utility item designed to be held by a Pokémon that initiates field effects. It functions as the terrain-based counterpart to the "Weather Rocks" (e.g., Damp Rock). It is a non-consumable held item that is generally available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder creates a Terrain effect (Electric, Grassy, Misty, or Psychic Terrain) via a move or an Ability, the duration of that terrain is extended from the standard **5 turns to 8 turns**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Moderate damage; no secondary effect upon Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** This item is essential for "Terrain Teams." It is frequently held by "Surge" ability users (such as Rillaboom, Indeedee, Pincurchin, or the Tapu guardians) to maximize the window for teammates to benefit from Terrain-boosted attacks or abilities like **Quark Drive** and **Surge Surfer**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with terrain-setting Abilities (Electric Surge, Grassy Surge, Misty Surge, Psychic Surge) and the four core Terrain moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in post-game Battle Facilities (like the Battle Tree or Battle Tower) or specialized boutiques in later generations (such as Delibird Presents in Paldea). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. This is a manufactured tactical item rather than a natural resource, meaning it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
