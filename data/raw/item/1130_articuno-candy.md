## Identity & Utility
**Articuno Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable candy packed with energy. Unlike standard Stat Candies (like Quick Candy), this item is tailored specifically to the Articuno evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be purchased from standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal sell value**; primarily obtained through gameplay loops rather than commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by an **Articuno**, it increases all six of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 Awakening Value (AV)** point. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move **Fling** does not exist in the *Let's Go* titles where this item is used).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough Specific.** This item is used exclusively to maximize the "Awakened" stats of Articuno in the Kanto-region remakes. It is not used in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as the AV (Awakening Value) system is separate from the traditional EV (Effort Value) system used in the core series.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the level requirements of standard candies, allowing for significant power scaling regardless of the Pokémon's current level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Marts. It is primarily earned by **transferring Articuno** to Professor Oak, or by walking with an Articuno stored inside a **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral. In *Pokémon GO* integration, it may be obtained by sending Articuno to the Go Park complex.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The most reliable "farming" method involves catching multiple Articuno (via rare spawns or legendary encounters) and transferring the excess to the Professor to receive their specific candy in return.
