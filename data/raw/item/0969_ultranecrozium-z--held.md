## Identity & Utility
**Ultranecrozium Z** is a specialized **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** This crystal is a condensed form of Z-Power specifically tuned to the legendary Pokémon Necrozma. Unlike standard Z-Crystals that only provide a powered-up move, this item acts as a catalyst for a unique transformation. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Event/Story Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Dusk Mane Necrozma** or **Dawn Wings Necrozma** that knows the move **Photon Geyser**, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Ultra Burst** during battle. This transformation turns the Pokémon into **Ultra Necrozma**. 
* **Z-Move Activation:** Once Ultra Burst has occurred, the Ultranecrozium Z allows Ultra Necrozma to upgrade its *Photon Geyser* into the devastating move: **Light That Burns the Sky** (Base Power: 200, ignores the target's Ability).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be thrown via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Ubers Tier Staple (Gen VII).** In its debut generation, this item was mandatory for utilizing Ultra Necrozma, one of the most powerful offensive threats in the history of the game. It effectively combined the power of a Mega Evolution with the single-use nuke of a Z-Move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * This item is unique to Necrozma’s fused forms.
    * It cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, and cannot be traded if held by a Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the main storyline of **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon** after the player defeats Ultra Necrozma at Megalo Tower and subsequently encounters Necrozma at Mount Lanakila.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact associated with the "Blinding One."
* **World Context:** In Alolan lore, this crystal represents the restored light of Necrozma. Because Z-Crystals were removed in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and onward, this item is currently exclusive to Generation VII gameplay.
