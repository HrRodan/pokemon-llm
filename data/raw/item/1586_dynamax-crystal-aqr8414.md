## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Aqr8414)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-exclusive item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. This specific crystal (Aqr8414) causes a specific encounter—typically **Larvitar** (in Pokémon Sword) or **Jangmo-o** (in Pokémon Shield)—to appear regardless of standard weather or den rotations. It is a **Consumable** item that disappears after use or at the end of the day.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal cost in the data, it cannot be purchased from standard Poke Marts and is obtained through external distribution.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), a red beam is activated. This allows the player to challenge a specific Max Raid Battle. The encounter persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching Pokémon with high IVs, specific Natures, or Hidden Abilities early in a playthrough.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a beacon for the Max Raid Battle mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **Pre-order Bonus** for the *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* Dual Pack or through specific retail promotions (such as Target or GAME serial codes). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is exclusively provided to the player via **Serial Code** entry in the Mystery Gift menu.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent a way for trainers to "summon" specific rare Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or locked to late-game areas, facilitating early-game access to pseudo-legendary lines like Tyranitar or Kommo-o.
