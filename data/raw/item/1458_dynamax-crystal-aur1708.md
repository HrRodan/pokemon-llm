## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AUR1708** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, event-exclusive consumable item used within the Galar Wild Area. When brought to the Watchtower Lair, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to manifest until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; the nominal cost is a placeholder for internal game logic as these are distributed via Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to initiate a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon. This allows players to encounter rare or version-exclusive Pokémon regardless of the current weather or standard spawn tables. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is used via the overworld interface at a specific location).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, it is high-value for competitive preparation as it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon that may have **Hidden Abilities (HA)**, high individual values (IVs), or Gigantamax potential, which are essential for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly an encounter-management tool. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed as **promotional bonuses**. Specifically, Dynamax Crystals like AUR1708 were often included with dual-pack preorders of *Pokémon Sword and Shield* or through retail distributions (such as GameStop or specialized movie events). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "out-of-game" acquisition item, typically delivered via the **Mystery Gift** function.
* **Lore Context:** The Watchtower Lair is a unique Power Spot that remains dormant unless activated by these specific crystals, suggesting they contain highly concentrated Galar Particle energy capable of forced Dynamaxing.
