## Identity & Utility
**Pachirisu Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of soft, static-filled fur dropped by a Pachirisu. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or used at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for Pokémon evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **TM Machine** interface. Based on world knowledge, it is specifically required for crafting Electric-type moves such as:
    * **TM023 (Charge Beam)**
    * **TM147 (Wild Charge)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop by defeating or catching wild **Pachirisu**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is automatically added to the player's inventory upon a successful encounter with a Pachirisu. It is commonly farmed in grassy areas where Pachirisu congregate, such as the South Province or West Province of Paldea.
* **Context:** This material represents the shift in Generation IX toward a resource-gathering loop, where players must hunt specific species to gain the ability to teach powerful moves to their team.
