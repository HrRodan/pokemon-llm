## Identity & Utility
**Power Lens** is an **Effort-Training** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized training weight to be held by a Pokémon. It is designed to hone the holder's mental focus at the expense of physical mobility. It is a **Holdable Training Item** that is typically purchased through specialized currency (Battle Points) rather than standard shops.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, though frequently acquired via 16 BP in various Battle Facilities or 10,000 Poké Dollars at Delibird Presents in Paldea).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon’s **Speed is reduced by 50%**. In exchange, the holder gains an additional **4 Effort Values (EVs) in Special Attack** for every Pokémon defeated. This bonus is applied before the doubling effect of PokéRUS.
    * *World Knowledge Note:* Starting in Generation VII, the EV bonus was increased from **+4 to +8**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Provides moderate physical damage but no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Developmental.** This item has no viable use in ranked VGC or Smogon formats as the Speed penalty is a massive liability. It is, however, an **essential tool for competitive preparation**, used to "EV train" Pokémon to their maximum Special Attack potential.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding (IV Transfer):** From Generation IV onwards, if a parent holds a Power Lens while in the Daycare or Nursery, the offspring is guaranteed to inherit the parent's **Special Attack IV**.
    * **Klutz:** Pokémon with the Klutz ability will have their Speed restored to normal but will not gain the bonus Special Attack EVs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually restricted to post-game "Battle Hubs" (Battle Frontier, Battle Maison, Battle Tree). In modern titles like *Scarlet & Violet*, it is more accessible, sold at **Delibird Presents** locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is an artificial training tool produced for trainers to optimize their team's performance.
