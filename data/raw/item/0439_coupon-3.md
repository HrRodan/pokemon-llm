## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum*, and their remakes (*Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl*), this coupon is obtained in **Jubilife City**. The player must find three Clowns distributed throughout the city and answer a simple Pokémon-related trivia question correctly. Each Clown provides one of the three numbered coupons.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique quest item and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore Context:** The coupons were part of a promotional campaign by the Pokétch Company to market their new multi-functional watch to aspiring Trainers. Providing three correct answers to the Clowns proved the Trainer had the basic knowledge necessary to utilize the device.
