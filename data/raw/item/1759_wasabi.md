## Identity & Utility
**Wasabi** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A pungent, spicy condiment used exclusively in the Picnic mechanic of Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be purchased in bulk once the player has progressed sufficiently through the Gym Challenge. Unlike traditional battle items, it cannot be held by a Pokémon and is used solely for crafting sandwiches to trigger Meal Powers.
* **Cost:** 330 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich during a Picnic, Wasabi contributes significantly to the flavor profile, providing high values in **Spicy**, **Bitter**, and **Sour** notes. These flavors determine the resulting **Meal Powers**, which grant temporary world bonuses such as increased Shiny encounter rates (Sparkling Power), increased EXP, or better Raid rewards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. Its value is entirely localized to the "overworld" sandwich-building mini-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle-specific abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is strictly a crafting component.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Wasabi is primarily available for purchase at the **Aquiesta Supermarket** located in **Levincia**. In the Paldean economy, it is considered a specialty ingredient and typically becomes available for purchase after the player has obtained at least **four Gym Badges**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from dedicated food vendors or occasionally received as a reward from NPCs for participating in high-level Tera Raid Battles.
