## Identity & Utility
**Toxic Orb** is a Strategic Held Item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A bizarre orb that emits a potent toxin. It is a **Held Item** that is technically categorized under "bad-held-items" because it inflicts a negative status condition on the holder. However, in professional play, it is a high-skill utility tool used to activate specific abilities.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive; often gated behind post-game Battle Points/BP in most regions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** At the end of the first turn the Pokémon is active in battle, the Toxic Orb inflicts the **Badly Poisoned** (Toxic) status condition on the holder. The activation occurs after the point in the turn where status damage would normally be calculated, meaning the holder takes no damage on the turn of infection.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30.
    * **Fling Effect:** If used with the move **Fling**, it consumes the item and **Badly Poisons** the target.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** It is the mandatory trigger for Pokémon with the **Poison Heal** ability (e.g., **Gliscor**, **Breloom**), providing them with 12.5% HP recovery per turn and immunity to other status conditions like Sleep or Paralysis. It is also a primary activator for abilities like **Guts**, **Toxic Boost** (specifically for **Zangoose**), and **Quick Feet**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the move **Trick** or **Switcheroo**, allowing a player to "gift" the orb to an opponent to put them on a ticking damage clock. It is rendered useless if the holder has the ability **Klutz** or is a **Poison or Steel type** (unless the ability **Corrosion** is involved in a status transfer).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually unavailable in standard Marts during the main story. It is typically found in **Battle Frontier**, **Battle Subway**, or **Battle Maison** shops. It can also be found in specific late-game locations like the Great Marsh (Sinnoh) or via the **Cram-o-matic** (Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Muk** (5% chance). Advanced trainers often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the encounter rate and **Thief** or **Covet** to harvest the item from wild encounters.
