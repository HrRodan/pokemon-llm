## Identity & Utility
**Koffing Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike standard stat-boosting items (like Protein or Iron), this candy is tailored specifically to the Koffing evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold for a nominal fee but is primarily acquired through gameplay loops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a buy/sell price, it is rarely purchased from shops and is instead earned through catching mechanics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Koffing** or **Weezing**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 point in the **Awakening Value (AV)** system. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series mechanics. It is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats, which utilize the Effort Value (EV) system. In its native games, it is essential for optimizing a Weezing to face "Master Trainers" or for high-stat "No Restrictions" battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It only functions on members of its specific evolutionary family (Koffing and Weezing, including Galarian Weezing if present in a compatible engine).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Gen VII) by catching wild Koffing or Weezing. It is a reward for the "Catch Combo" mechanic or by transferring these Pokémon to Professor Oak.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item. It is a reward for the trainer's proficiency in habitat management (catching and transferring). In the *Let's Go* ecosystem, it represents a distilled essence of the Pokémon's vitality used to empower its peers.
