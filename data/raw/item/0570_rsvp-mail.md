## Identity & Utility
**RSVP Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** This item is specialized stationery designed to allow a Trainer to extend an invitation to another player. It is a **Held Item** used for communication; the player composes a message from a predetermined list of vocabulary words and gives it to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates player-to-player communication during Pokémon trades. Once a message is written, it is "locked" to the Pokémon. The recipient can read the message, store it in their PC, or erase it to make the stationery reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** While primarily a social item, Mail has a niche mechanical property: **Item Protection.** A Pokémon holding Mail cannot be placed into the PC, and it is immune to moves that remove or swap items, such as **Trick**, **Switcheroo**, **Thief**, **Covet**, and **Knock Off** (it cannot be removed, though Knock Off still deals damage). 
    * **Utility Context:** Despite the protection benefits, it is rarely used in competitive play (Smogon/VGC) as it prevents the holder from using impactful items like Leftovers or Life Orb. It is considered a **flavor/social item** for playthroughs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the UI by forcing the player to remove the item before the Pokémon can be deposited into a Storage System.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** (specifically in the Unova region) and specialized stationery shops. Due to its specific "Invitation" theme, it is often used for roleplaying or organizing in-game meetups between players.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through direct purchase or given by NPCs to encourage the use of the C-Gear and trading features.
