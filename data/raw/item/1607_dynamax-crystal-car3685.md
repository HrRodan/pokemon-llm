## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (car3685)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, consumable event item designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that functions as an encounter-facilitator rather than a traditional held item or medicine.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Placeholder). While it has a internal price value, it is **not for sale** in standard Poké Marts; it is an event-exclusive item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area of the Wild Area) while this crystal is in their inventory, it initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This particular crystal (`car3685`) is part of a series of promotional distributions (often tied to retail pre-orders or magazine codes like *CoroCoro*) that grant access to specific Gigantamax or rare encounters.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for facilitating encounters. However, the Pokémon caught from the resulting raid may have competitive value (e.g., Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax Factor).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the Max Raid Den mechanics of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It is consumed immediately upon the successful activation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained exclusively through **Serial Codes** or **Mystery Gift** distributions. Historically, these crystals were distributed via physical retail partnerships (such as Best Buy or GameStop) or special promotional tie-ins.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles, localized into a physical form to force a Dynamax manifestation in an otherwise dormant Power Spot. They allow trainers to target specific rare species that do not naturally appear in the standard raid rotation.
