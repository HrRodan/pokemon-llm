## Identity & Utility
**Phantump Twig** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A dropped material used in the crafting of Technical Machines (TMs). It represents a small part of the Phantump evolutionary line’s anatomy or essence, collected after defeating or catching them in the wild. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low purchase/sell price, its primary value lies in its use as a reagent at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item has no direct effect when used from the bag or held in battle. Its sole purpose is to serve as a **crafting ingredient** at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers to create specific moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials typically cannot be used effectively with Fling or have a base power of 10).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is part of the "Material Economy" for team building (move acquisition) but has no tactical utility within a competitive match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is not an evolution item. It is specifically linked to the **Phantump** and **Trevenant** evolutionary line as a drop. In the context of Gen IX mechanics, it is used to craft moves like **TM151 (Phantom Force)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after battling wild **Phantump** or **Trevenant**. In the *Teal Mask* DLC (Paldea/Kitakami), these are common spawns in forested and grassy areas like the Timeless Woods.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item does not appear as a standard "Held Item" in the traditional sense; rather, it is automatically rewarded to the player’s inventory upon a successful encounter (Capture or Knockout). Unlike items gathered via **Pickup**, these are consistent rewards for targeting specific species.
