## Identity & Utility
**TM147 (Wild Charge)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Machine allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Wild Charge**. It is a single-use consumable item in the Paldea region that is primarily obtained through crafting or exploration. Unlike TMs in Generations V through VIII, this item is consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **10,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials to craft at a TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Wild Charge**, a powerful Physical Electric-type attack. 
    * **Move Stats:** 90 Power / 100 Accuracy.
    * **Recoil:** The user receives recoil damage equal to 1/4 of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-tier Coverage.** Wild Charge is the standard Physical Electric-type move for non-signature users. It is a staple for physical attackers (like Arcanine, Zacian-Crowned, or Iron Valiant) to provide coverage against Water and Flying-type threats, despite the drawback of recoil damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Crafting:** Can be manufactured at any TM Machine using **10,000 LP**, **3x Shinx Fang**, and **3x Toxel Sparks**.
    * **Location:** Can be found as a collectible item in the overworld within the Paldea region (notably in the South Province or via high-level Tera Raid rewards).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; however, the materials required to craft it must be harvested from wild **Shinx** and **Toxel** evolutionary lines.
