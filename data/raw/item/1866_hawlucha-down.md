## Identity & Utility
**Hawlucha Down** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized material dropped by wild Hawlucha. It is primarily used as a crafting component at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Resource** that can be sold, but is generally retained for move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard Crafting Value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a currency/ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, it is notably required to craft high-impact moves such as **TM064 (Bulk Up)**, **TM158 (Focus Blast)**, and **TM167 (Close Combat)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively held in battle for Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists purely within the crafting economy of the overworld and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "TM Materials" ecosystem used exclusively at the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching a wild **Hawlucha**. It may also be found as a sparkling pickup on the ground in areas where Hawlucha spawn, such as the mountains and forests of the Paldea region (e.g., South Province Area Four or North Province Area One).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is "yielded" by wild **Hawlucha** upon defeat. It is not compatible with the Pickup ability, as it is a specific drop-table item for the species.
