## Identity & Utility
**Slowpoke-tail** (Slowpoke Tail) is a **Valuable/Exchange Item** (formally categorized as "unused" in modern technical data) introduced as a significant plot element in **Generation II**.
* **Description:** Described as a "very tasty tail of something," it is primarily a vendor-trash item designed to be sold for a high price. It is a **Consumable/Exchange** item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts (though it is famously offered by NPCs for an unattainable price in early-game scenarios).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). While it cannot be bought from marts, its sell value is historically high (e.g., 4,900 Poké Dollars in some iterations), making it a "nugget-tier" treasure.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Mechanically, the Slowpoke Tail **does nothing** when held or used in battle. Its sole purpose in the inventory is to be sold for currency or to progress specific regional flavor text.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It holds no tactical value in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battle facilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does **not** trigger evolution (contrary to common myths regarding Slowbro or Slowking, which require levels or a King's Rock, respectively). In Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), it was rebranded as the "Smoke-Poke Tail," a key ingredient for the **Curry Dex**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via special NPCs or found as hidden items in the overworld. Historically, it is associated with **Team Rocket's** illicit activities in the Slowpoke Well (Johto), where they harvested tails for profit.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is **not** naturally held by wild Slowpoke in standard gameplay to prevent the player from farming high-value items too easily. It is typically a fixed-location reward or a plot-specific item.
* **Lore Context:** The item is controversial in the Pokémon world; while the flavor text describes it as "tasty," the act of cutting off Slowpoke tails is depicted as a cruel practice by villainous teams, despite the tails being known to fall off naturally and grow back.
