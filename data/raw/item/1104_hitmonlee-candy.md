## Identity & Utility
**Hitmonlee Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically for the Hitmonlee evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is technically purchasable but primarily earned through gameplay actions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though its primary value is in its rarity and acquisition through effort rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a Hitmonlee, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 Awakening Value (AV)**. This is the primary method for "stat-prodding" in the *Let's Go* series, allowing a Pokémon to reach its maximum potential regardless of its level.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held item mechanics are absent in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* engine. In that specific competitive meta, maximizing AVs via species candy is mandatory for high-level play, though it has no utility in standard Smogon or VGC formats where AVs do not exist.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancement tool. It is most effective on Hitmonlee compared to generic "Size" candies (Quick Candy, etc.) because it raises every stat at once rather than just one.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!* by:
    * **Catching wild Hitmonlee:** High "Catch Combos" increase the likelihood of receiving species-specific candy.
    * **Transferring to Professor Oak:** Sending multiple Hitmonlee to the Professor rewards the player with these candies.
    * **Walking with Pokémon:** Using the Poké Ball Plus accessory to take a Hitmonlee for a stroll.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense; instead, it is a **reward drop** upon a successful capture or through the **GO Park** transfer system from *Pokémon GO*.
