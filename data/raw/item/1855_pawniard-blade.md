## Identity & Utility
**Pawniard Blade** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A physical material dropped by members of the Pawniard evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as a crafting ingredient at the **Technical Machine Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. It is required to create specific TMs, typically those associated with Steel or Dark-type physical moves (such as **TM088 Swords Dance** or **TM170 Steel Roller**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely within the overworld economy and crafting systems. It provides no statistical or tactical advantage in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it bears the name of the Pokémon, it is not an evolution item (Pawniard evolves into Bisharp via leveling, and Bisharp into Kingambit via defeating Bisharp holding Leader's Crests). It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Pawniard**, **Bisharp**, or **Kingambit**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon the conclusion of a battle with the corresponding Pokémon species.
* **Context:** The item represents the sharp, blade-like appendages characteristic of the Pawniard line. In the Paldea region's ecosystem, these discarded or harvested blades are valued for their structural integrity, making them ideal components for programming and manufacturing technical combat data (TMs).
