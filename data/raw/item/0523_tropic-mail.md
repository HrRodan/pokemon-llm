## Identity & Utility
**Tropic-Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A stationary item featuring a decorative print of the Pokémon **Bellossom**. It is a **Consumable/Communication** item that is held by a Pokémon to facilitate social interaction between Trainers. It can be bought at various Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a predetermined list of words and phrases. When held by a Pokémon, the message can be sent to another player via trading. Once the recipient reads and erases the message, the item is returned to the inventory and can be reused.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Protection Mechanic:** While a Pokémon is holding Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC**. Furthermore, the item is protected from moves that manipulate held items; moves like **Thief, Covet, Trick, or Knock Off** will fail to remove or steal this item from the holder.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Obsolete.** Historically, Mail was occasionally used in competitive play specifically to block *Trick* or *Thief* users, as the item cannot be removed. However, its utility is strictly defensive and provides no stat or recovery benefits, making it inferior to modern competitive items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely for communication and cosmetic purposes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in the Hoenn and Kanto (FRLG) regions. It is often found in shops located in tropical or coastal areas to match the Bellossom theme.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon; it is primarily obtained through direct purchase or player-to-player trading.
* **Lore:** The "Tropic" branding and Bellossom imagery emphasize the aesthetic of the Hoenn region's lush, warm climate. It serves as a souvenir-style stationary for Trainers traveling through the southern islands of the Pokémon world.
