## Identity & Utility
**TR40 (Skill Swap)** is a **Technical Record (TR)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** TR40 is a single-use instruction manual used to teach the move **Skill Swap** to compatible Pokémon. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, TRs are **consumable** and break after one use. It represents a specialized tactical move used to manipulate the battlefield's mechanical properties.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In its native region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts (W)** at Wild Area Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Skill Swap**. When used in battle, the user employs psychic power to **permanently exchange Abilities** with the target for the remainder of the encounter (or until the Pokémon switches out).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling with this item deals minimal damage and provides no additional secondary effect.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Strategic Value.** In VGC and Double Battles, Skill Swap is a staple for "Ability Gardening." It is used to pass beneficial abilities to allies (e.g., giving *Huge Power* or *Levitate* to a teammate) or to neutralize threatening opponent abilities. It is also famously used to "reset" or remove crippling abilities like *Truant* (Slaking) or *Defeatist* (Archeops).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, certain abilities are "hard-coded" and cannot be swapped (e.g., *Wonder Guard*, *Stance Change*, *Ice Face*, or *Commander*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in **Pokémon Sword & Shield**. It is frequently available from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price in Watts. It can also be earned as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** against Psychic-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial data record. Acquisition relies entirely on the Galar region's unique economy of Raid rewards and Watt exchange.
