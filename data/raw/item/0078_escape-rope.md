## Identity & Utility
**Escape Rope** is a **Spelunking Utility Item** that has been a staple of the Pokémon series since Generation I (though the provided data highlights its profile from Generation IV and its modern transition in Generation VIII).
* **Description:** A long, durable rope designed for emergency extraction. It is used in the overworld to instantly transport the Trainer from deep within a cave or dungeon back to the last-entered entrance. While historically a consumable, modern iterations (Gen VIII onwards) treat it as a permanent utility tool.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used outside of battle within a cave or "dungeon" map script, it warps the player to the exterior entrance of that location.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; provides no additional secondary effect when thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a pure utility item for overworld navigation and has no viability in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions or specific ability interactions. Its primary function is a "quality of life" mechanic to avoid backtracking through wild encounters after completing a cave objective.
* **Usage Restrictions:** The rope is disabled in standard buildings, the open overworld, and specific legendary-event locations such as the **Distortion World**, **Hall of Origin**, **Spear Pillar**, or **Turnback Cave**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at most **Poké Marts** and Delibird Presents locations early in the game. It is frequently found as "ground loot" (item balls) inside the very caves where it is most useful.
* **Modern Evolution:** While the cost is listed at 300, it is important to note that as of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, the Escape Rope was reclassified as a **Key Item** with infinite uses, removing the need to stock up on multiples for long treks.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through purchase or exploration rather than through the **Pickup** ability or farming wild encounters.
