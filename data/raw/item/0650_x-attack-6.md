## Identity & Utility
**X-Attack-6** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A highly specialized battle-only consumable designed for the "Wonder Launcher" mechanic. It is used to provide an immediate, massive offensive surge to a physical attacker. Unlike standard X-Items, it cannot be used from the Bag in the overworld or in standard trainer battles.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is "purchased" during active combat using 11 accumulated Wonder Launcher points.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a Wonder Launcher battle, it instantly raises the target Pokémon's **Attack stat by six stages** (the maximum possible boost). This effectively quadruples the Pokémon's physical damage output (+300%).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Extremely Niche/Legacy.** This item only existed within the "Wonder Launcher" battle format of Black, White, Black 2, and White 2. Because this mechanic was localized to specific Gen V multiplayer modes and has not returned in subsequent generations, the item has no presence in modern VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Stat Reset:** As with all battle items, the boost is lost if the Pokémon switches out, is forced out (e.g., Roar), or if its ability is suppressed/changed by certain effects. 
    * **Mechanic Lock:** It is strictly tied to the Wonder Launcher; if the battle rules do not enable this feature, the item is inaccessible.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in the game world, given as a gift, or sold in Poké Marts. It is generated dynamically within a battle if the "Wonder Launcher" setting is turned on. Players earn points each turn and can "buy" this item once they have accumulated 11 points.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital construct of the Unova region's advanced battle simulation technology rather than a physical object found in nature.
