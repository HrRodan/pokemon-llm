## Identity & Utility
**Shroomish Spores** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by members of the Shroomish evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable/Resource** item that is primarily used at TM Machines. While it has a nominal sell price, it is intended for crafting rather than direct use.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found in Pokémon Centers. Examples of TMs requiring this material typically include those related to grass-type or powder-based moves (e.g., **TM071 Seed Bomb** or **TM081 Grass Knot**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item resides in the TM Materials pocket and cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no strategic value in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; it is purely a progression and utility resource for move acquisition.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency for the TM Machine and can also be exchanged for League Points (LP).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Shroomish** or **Breloom**. It is most efficiently farmed using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where these Pokémon spawn, such as the South Province (Area Five) or West Province (Area Three) in the Paldea region.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally "held" in the classic sense; it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Shroomish line. It is a fundamental part of the Paldean ecosystem's resource loop.
