## Identity & Utility
**Holo Caster** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos Region)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech communication device used to receive and view holographic video clips and messages from NPCs. It serves as a primary narrative tool for plot progression, allowing characters like Professor Sycamore, Lysandre, and the player's rivals to communicate remotely. It is a **Key Item** that is **Not for sale**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers and displays specific cutscene conversations and "Holo Clips" as the player advances through the story. It acts as the Kalos region's equivalent to the Pokegear or Xtransceiver, keeping the player informed of plot developments and regional news.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; it is strictly a narrative and utility tool for the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. It is purely a player-interface tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a mandatory story gift in **Pokémon X and Y**. It is typically given to the player by their rivals in Lumiose City after meeting Professor Sycamore for the first time.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. 
* **Historical Lore:** Developed by **Lysandre Labs**, the Holo Caster was marketed in-universe as a revolutionary communication device. In the original Nintendo 3DS release, it also functioned via **StreetPass and SpotPass** to deliver real-world news regarding official Pokémon tournaments, distributions, and local game events, though these online services are now largely discontinued.
