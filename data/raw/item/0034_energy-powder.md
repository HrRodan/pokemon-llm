## Identity & Utility
**Energy Powder** is a **Consumable Medicine (Herbal)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn Region)**.
* **Description:** A very bitter medicinal powder used to treat wounds. It is a consumable item usable both in the overworld and during battle. While it serves as a highly cost-effective alternative to standard manufactured potions, its extreme bitterness makes it distasteful to Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Compared to a Super Potion (700 PD), it provides similar or superior healing for a lower price point.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores the HP of a single Pokémon. 
    * **Legacy (Gen 2-6):** Restores **50 HP**.
    * **Modern (Gen 7+):** Restores **60 HP**.
    * **Friendship Penalty:** Because of its bitterness, using this item reduces the Pokémon's Friendship (Happiness) by **5 to 10 points**, depending on the current friendship tier.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Consumable medicines are restricted in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon). 
    * **Nuzlocke/Playthrough Utility:** Highly efficient for budget-conscious trainers. It is a staple for "Nuzlocke" challenges where funds are limited, though trainers must be careful not to use it on Pokémon that require high friendship to evolve (e.g., Golbat, Chansey, or Lucario).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly counter-productive for Pokémon that evolve via high friendship. It has no effect on abilities like Pickup regarding its consumption, though it is categorized as a "bitter" medicine which triggers certain flavor-based reactions in specific games.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically unavailable at standard Poké Marts. It must be purchased from specialized **Herbal Shops** (e.g., the Herb Shop in Lavaridge Town, Slateport City, or the Pharmacy in Johto).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. 
* **Lore Context:** Herbal medicine represents a traditional, natural alternative to Silph Co. or Devon Corp technology. While effective and "organic," the lack of refinement results in the pungent bitterness that Pokémon dislike. It is often used by trainers who prioritize financial efficiency over their bond with their Pokémon.
