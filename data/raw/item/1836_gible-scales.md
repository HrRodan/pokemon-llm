## Identity & Utility
**Gible Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Gible evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) located at Pokémon Centers. While it has a defined internal cost, it is primarily a resource rather than a traditional shop item.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). In-game, this value typically represents its League Point (LP) conversion rate or sell price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific component for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). These materials are combined with League Points (LP) to create reusable moves for a trainer's roster.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle; has no Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it has no direct utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. Its value lies entirely in the "out-of-battle" preparation phase for teaching Pokémon high-value moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency for the TM crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Gible family.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. Instead, it is automatically rewarded after encounters with:
    1.  **Gible**
    2.  **Gabite**
    3.  **Garchomp**
* **Lore Context:** These scales are tough and characteristic of the "Land Shark" Pokémon. In the Paldea region, the ecosystem allows trainers to collect these remnants to synthesize data-discs (TMs) for moves such as **TM078 (Dragon Claw)** or **TM169 (Draco Meteor)**, reflecting the biological strengths of the Pokémon they originated from.
