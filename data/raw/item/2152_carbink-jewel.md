## Identity & Utility
**Carbink Jewel** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting component dropped by the Jewel Pokémon, Carbink. As a material, it is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific moves. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold, but not used directly in battle or overworld traversal.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount, its value lies almost entirely in its utility as a reagent for move-teaching items.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a currency/reagent for crafting TMs. When combined with League Points (LP) at a Pokémon Center's TM Machine, it allows the player to "print" specific Technical Machines.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None directly.** However, it is an essential resource for obtaining high-tier competitive moves. In the Paldea region and its expansions, Carbink Jewels are required to craft moves such as **TM101 (Power Gem)** and **TM161 (Trick Room)**, both of which are staples in VGC and Smogon singles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a material harvested from the Carbink evolutionary line.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching a wild **Carbink**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; rather, it is added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag upon a successful encounter with a wild Carbink.
* **Lore context:** Carbink are born from high temperatures and pressures deep underground. The "Jewel" is a crystalline fragment of its body that maintains its luster even after being separated from the host Pokémon. It is found most frequently in cavernous biomes (such as the caves of the Terarium in the Blueberry Academy).
