## Identity & Utility
**Micle Berry** is a specialized **Consumable Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A rare, holdable berry designed for "in-a-pinch" situations. When a Pokémon's health drops to a critical level, it consumes the berry to grant a one-time focus boost. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that is technically priced low but is typically unavailable through standard retail means.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap, but generally restricted to special distributions, specific Berry Master rewards, or endgame locations).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder’s HP falls below **25% (1/4)** of its maximum, the berry is consumed, and the accuracy of the Pokémon's **next move** is increased. 
    * **Modern Mechanics (Gen V+):** Increases accuracy by **1.2×**.
    * **Legacy Mechanics (Gen IV):** The next move is guaranteed to hit (effectively granting the move "Sure-hit" status for one turn).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Consumes the berry and applies the accuracy boost effect to the target, which is generally disadvantageous).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Rock-type** attack with **100 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-niche competitive item. It is most effectively used in combination with **Endure** or the **Sturdy** ability to safely reach the 25% HP threshold. It is occasionally seen on sets utilizing low-accuracy, high-reward moves like *Sleep Powder*, *Hydro Pump*, or even *OHKO moves* (in formats where they are permitted) to ensure a crucial hit in a late-game "sweep" scenario.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Gluttony** (causing the Pokémon to eat the berry at 50% HP instead of 25%) and **Unburden** (doubling Speed once the berry is consumed).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically one of the rarest berries. It was initially distributed via **Nintendo Events** (specifically for the 11th Pokémon movie) and later made available through the Dream World (Gen V) or the Berry Master/Mutation mechanics in later generations. It is not found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is **not** found on any wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to specialized berry trees, events, or the **Pickup** ability in very high-level brackets in specific titles (e.g., Pokémon Emerald/Platinum/Battle Frontier rewards).
