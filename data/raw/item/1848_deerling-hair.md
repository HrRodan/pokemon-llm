## Identity & Utility
**Deerling Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a small clump of hair shed by or collected from the Pokémon Deerling. It is a specialized crafting reagent used exclusively at the **Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine)** found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be bought directly from standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Common reagent).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, Deerling Hair is utilized to craft moves that align with Deerling’s Normal/Grass typing and its seasonal themes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly. However, it is vital for the **metagame infrastructure**, as players must farm this material to craft high-tier competitive TMs such as **TM119 (Energy Ball)** and **TM159 (Leaf Storm)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the TM Machine's crafting recipes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop by defeating or catching wild **Deerling** or its evolution, **Sawsbuck**. It is most commonly farmed in the various provinces of Paldea where Deerling congregate according to the season.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop from the **Deerling line**. Players often use the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature to quickly farm large quantities of this material.
* **Context:** As a TM Material, it represents the shift in Generation IX toward a crafting-based economy, requiring players to interact with the local ecology to teach their Pokémon new moves.
