## Identity & Utility
**TM113 (Tailwind)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced as this specific ID in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that imparts the move **Tailwind** to compatible Pokémon. In the modern Paldean and Terarium ecosystems, TMs are single-use consumable items that must be crafted or found.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration or synthesized at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Tailwind**. When used in battle, Tailwind creates a gust of wind that **doubles the Speed stat** of the user and all allied Pokémon for four turns. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; TMs are generally not used for Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Support Staple.** Tailwind is a defining element of the VGC (Doubles) metagame. It provides essential speed control, allowing "mid-speed" powerhouses to outpace faster threats. It is frequently seen on "Prankster" ability users (like Murkrow or Whimsicott) for priority activation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time use item per craft; once the move is taught, the TM is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed throughout the **Paldea Region** and the **Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk)**. It can be found as a collectible item in the overworld or rewarded by Battle Court officials.
* **TM Machine Synthesis:** To craft TM113, the player typically requires:
    * **800 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Fletchling Feather**
    * **3x Rookidee Feather**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; however, players must hunt wild **Fletchling**, **Rookidee**, and their respective evolutionary lines to gather the biological components necessary to manufacture the disk.
