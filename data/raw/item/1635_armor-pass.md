## Identity & Utility
**Armor Pass** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized travel permit used to access the **Isle of Armor**, a sub-region of Galar. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or held by Pokémon. In the game world, it is presented to rail staff at Wedgehurst Station to initiate transport.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through special events/DLC).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player access to the Corviknight Taxi and rail services specifically for the Isle of Armor. Once in the player's Bag, it triggers the event dialogue with the station attendant in Wedgehurst, allowing the player to travel to the **Fields of Honor** station.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a Key Item, it has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; its purpose is strictly for world navigation and story progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not directly evolve Pokémon, but it is the prerequisite for obtaining items found on the Isle of Armor that *do* trigger evolutions (e.g., Galarica Twigs for Slowbro or the Scrolls for Kubfu).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically obtained by players who have purchased the *Pokémon Sword* or *Pokémon Shield* **Expansion Pass**. Upon entering Wedgehurst Station for the first time after purchasing the DLC, the player receives the pass as part of the introductory cutscene involving a Galarian Slowpoke.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, Key Items like the Armor Pass cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or stolen using moves like Thief.
* **Context:** This item represents the first wave of the Generation VIII Expansion Pass, signifying a shift in the series' post-game content delivery from "third versions" (like *Platinum*) to downloadable content.
