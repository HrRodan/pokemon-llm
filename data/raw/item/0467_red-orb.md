## Identity & Utility
**Red Orb** is a **Plot Advancement (Key/Held) Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A shiny, legendary artifact with a deep connection to the Hoenn region. It serves a dual purpose: historically as a plot-critical Key Item used to interact with legendary Pokémon, and mechanically as a specialized Held Item for Groudon. It **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique Key/Quest Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In specific narrative contexts (Generation IV), it is used to summon **Groudon** to the Embedded Tower. In Generation VI and VII, it functions as a **Held Item** that triggers **Primal Reversion** for Groudon immediately upon entering battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (VGC Staple - Gen VI/VII).** As the trigger for Primal Groudon, this item was mandatory for one of the most dominant forces in competitive history. Primal Reversion grants Groudon the "Desolate Land" ability and a Fire/Ground typing, making the Red Orb a centerpiece of "Restricted" format teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Primal Reversion:** While held by Groudon, it transforms the Pokémon into **Primal Groudon** for the duration of the battle. Unlike Mega Evolution, this does not require a button press and does not use the team's Mega Evolution slot.
    * **Ability Interaction:** Cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by Groudon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via story progression. 
    * **Hoenn (OR/AS):** Obtained at Mt. Pyre or Sootopolis City.
    * **Johto (HG/SS):** Received from Mr. Pokémon after obtaining the National Pokédex and meeting specific conditions (SoulSilver).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique legendary artifact, often guarded by the elders of **Mt. Pyre** in the Hoenn region to keep the ancient powers of Groudon in check.
