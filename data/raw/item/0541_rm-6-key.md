## Identity & Utility
**Rm. 6 Key** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A specialized key used to unlock Room 6 within the Abandoned Ship (or Sea Mauville in later iterations). The flavor text describes it as an old, fragile-looking key. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be held by Pokémon, traded, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest item that must be found through exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants access to Room 6 of the Abandoned Ship/Sea Mauville. Unlocking this door is a mandatory step in the sub-quest to navigate the ship's interior, leading to the discovery of other keys and eventually the **Scanner**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no application in competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) as it exists solely for overworld puzzle progression and story advancement.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities. Its utility is strictly restricted to environmental interaction.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Located specifically within the **Abandoned Ship** (Route 108 in the Hoenn region). In the original Generation III games, it is typically found by diving in the flooded sections of the ship and searching specific tiles or containers within the preceding rooms (Room 4).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind object acquired through environmental looting.
* **Context:** The Room 6 Key is part of a "Key Chain" puzzle where finding one key allows access to the next (Rm 1 -> Rm 2 -> Rm 4 -> Rm 6). Completing this sequence is necessary to find the **Scanner**, which can be traded to Captain Stern in Slateport City for either a Deep Sea Tooth or a Deep Sea Scale.
