## Identity & Utility
**Wishing-Chip** is a specialized item categorized under **"Unused"** items, introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** Based on its internal data, it was intended to be tossed into Pokémon Dens to attract wild Dynamax Pokémon. It is a **Non-Consumable/Key Item prototype** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts. Within the final release of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, this item was functionally replaced by the "Wishing Piece."
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While listed as having no active effect in the final game's engine, its flavor text indicates it was designed to trigger a **Max Raid Battle** by activating an empty Pokémon Den in the Wild Area, Isle of Armor, or Crown Tundra.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a field-use prototype item. In competitive VGC or Smogon formats, it has no utility as it cannot be held by a Pokémon and provides no stat or tactical benefits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve any Pokémon nor does it interact with abilities like Pickup. It is purely a mechanical trigger for the Dynamax Den system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Wishing-Chip is **not available through normal gameplay.** It exists within the game's code as a leftover or beta version of the **Wishing Piece**. Unlike the Wishing Piece, which is purchased with Watts (W), the Wishing-Chip has no legitimate acquisition method in the retail versions of *Pokémon Sword and Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a "dummy" item within the inventory system, often studied by data miners to understand the development cycle of the Galar region's raid mechanics.
