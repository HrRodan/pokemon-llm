## Identity & Utility
**Brick Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a distinctive, tough-looking brick pattern. It is a consumable held item used primarily for social communication between Trainers. It can be purchased easily at most retail locations within its debut region.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message from a predetermined list of words and phrases. Once written, the mail is given to a Pokémon to hold. When the Pokémon is traded, the recipient can read the message. The recipient can then choose to erase the message to reuse the stationery or store the message in the Trainer's PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 0 (Mail cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While primarily a social tool, Mail items have a unique mechanical niche: **they cannot be removed or swapped in battle.** Moves like **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Covet**, **Trick**, and **Switcheroo** will fail against a Pokémon holding Brick Mail. Historically, this was used in niche competitive sets to prevent a Pokémon from being "Trick-locked" into a Choice item or losing its held item, though it comes at the high opportunity cost of not being able to hold a stat-boosting or healing item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it features a unique system constraint: **a Pokémon holding Mail cannot be placed into the PC storage system**, forcing the Trainer to remove the Mail before depositing the Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at Poké Marts and specialty shops (such as the Celadon Dept. Store or the Veilstone Dept. Store) in Generations IV and V. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased by the Trainer.
* **Context:** Brick Mail represents the era of Pokémon focused on "handheld-to-handheld" social interaction. As the series moved toward more robust online communication and Global Trade Stations (GTS), the Mail system was eventually deprecated and removed from the games starting in Generation VI.
