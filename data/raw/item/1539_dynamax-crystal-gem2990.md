## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Gem2990)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable item used in the Wild Area of Galar. When used at the **Watchtower Lair**, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; effectively **Not for sale** through standard vendors, as these are typically event-exclusive distribution items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon (defined by the crystal's ID) to appear as a Max Raid Boss. This raid remains active until defeated or until the daily reset.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item used exclusively for PvE (Player vs. Environment) content to encounter specific Pokémon, often with hidden abilities or high individual values (IVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which summon random raids, this crystal guarantees a specific encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed via **Serial Codes** as pre-order bonuses (e.g., from retailers like GameStop, EB Games, or Amazon) or as part of special promotional events. They are not found in standard Poké Marts or through the Curry Dex.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. They are strictly "Key-like" consumable items granted to the player through external distribution channels.
* **Context:** In the Galar region lore, these crystals focus Power Spot energy to summon a Dynamax Pokémon instantly, bypassing the natural "recharge" time of a Max Raid den.
