## Identity & Utility
**Bug Tera Shard** is a specialized resource and enhancement item categorized as a **Tera Shard**, introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A mysterious shard of crystallized energy that glows with a pale green hue. It is a **Consumable Crafting/Service Item** used specifically to manipulate the Terastal phenomenon. While it can be sold at shops, it cannot be purchased through standard Poke Marts; it must be gathered through exploration and combat.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap sell value; however, its functional value as a resource is significantly higher).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Bug Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded to the chef at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali**. This service permanently changes a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to **Bug**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle; it resides in the "Treasures" or "Items" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Strategic. While the Bug type is often considered a poor defensive type due to weaknesses to Fire, Flying, and Rock, "Tera Bug" is occasionally used defensively to gain resistances to **Ground, Fighting, and Grass**. It is also used by specific offensive threats (like Roaring Moon or Scizor) to gain STAB on Bug-type moves like U-turn or First Impression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for the **Terastal** mechanic. It interacts with the player's inventory as a "stackable" currency.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by defeating or catching Pokémon in **Tera Raid Battles** (specifically 3-star raids or higher that feature the Bug Tera Type). They are also found as rare sparkling pickups in **Area Zero (The Great Crater of Paldea)** or as rewards from the Academy Ace Tournament.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. The primary "farming" source is the repeatable **Tera Raid** system. In the DLC (The Indigo Disk), they can also be produced via the **Cram-o-matic** style "Item Printer" in the Blueberry Academy League Club Room.
