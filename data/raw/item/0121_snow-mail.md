## Identity & Utility
**Snow Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Stationery featuring a print of a chilly, snow-covered world. It is a **Consumable/Social** item that can be bought at various Poké Marts. It allows Trainers to compose short messages using a pre-defined list of words and phrases to be sent to other players during a trade.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When given to a Pokémon to hold, the player can write a message. This message is displayed when the recipient receives the Pokémon. Once the message is read and deleted by the recipient, the Mail returns to the player’s bag as basic stationery or is consumed depending on the generation's specific mechanic (typically consumed upon use in Gen IV).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Sticky Item Mechanic:** A Pokémon holding Mail **cannot be placed into the PC storage system**. Furthermore, any move that attempts to remove, steal, or swap the item—such as **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Covet**, **Trick**, or **Switcheroo**—will automatically fail.
    * **Competitive Use:** While not a statistical buff, Mail was historically used as a "niche counter" to item-manipulation strategies. In older competitive formats, it could be used to protect a Pokémon from losing its item or being forced into a Choice item via *Trick*, though this utility is largely obsolete in modern generations where Mail has been phased out or replaced by more effective "sticky" items like Mega Stones or Z-Crystals.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the game's trading and communication systems.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in the Sinnoh region, particularly in northern or snowy areas like **Snowpoint City**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly a retail item intended for Trainer-to-Trainer communication.
* **Thematic Context:** Part of a set of regional stationery, Snow Mail reflects the climate of Northern Sinnoh and served as an early form of "flavor" text for the series' burgeoning global trade system (GTS) during the DS era.
