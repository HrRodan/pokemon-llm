## Identity & Utility
**Pikanium Z (Bag)** is a **Signature Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This specialized crystal is a manifestation of Z-Power designed specifically for the Pokémon Pikachu. It is a **Key Item/Held Item** (represented here in its inventory/bag form) that **cannot be bought or sold**. It is categorized as a "Signature" item because it only functions with a specific species.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; unique quest-based acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Pikachu** that knows the move **Volt Tackle**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Catastropika**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be thrown via Fling, nor can they be removed or stolen by moves like Thief or Knock Off).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Niche Offensive Powerhouse**. While Pikachu is fragile, Catastropika is a physical Electric-type move with a massive **210 Base Power**, making it one of the strongest single-target nukes in the Generation VII meta. It is preferred over Electrium Z for Pikachu-specific builds focused on maximum damage output.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard Z-Crystals (like Electrium Z), this crystal will not function if held by Raichu or Alolan Raichu; it is strictly limited to the base Pikachu species. It does not trigger evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained in **Konikoni City**. A woman standing with three Pikachu near the lighthouse grants it to the player after they have shown her a Pikachu.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact granted to the trainer, often associated with the "Pikashunium Z" (for Cap Pikachu), though the Pikanium Z specifically requires the move Volt Tackle—a move traditionally obtained via breeding with a Light Ball.
