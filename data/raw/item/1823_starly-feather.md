## Identity & Utility
**Starly Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A dropped material shed by members of the Starly evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Commodity). While it has a low sell price, its primary value lies in its utility at the Technical Machine Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific component in the crafting of **Technical Machines (TMs)**. Players must combine Starly Feathers with League Points and other materials to "print" specific move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no statistical or tactical advantage during a battle and cannot be held by a Pokémon for an in-battle effect. Its utility is strictly restricted to out-of-battle preparation and move-set customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it is fundamentally linked to the **Starly, Staravia, and Staraptor** species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Starly family. It is typically found in the early-to-mid game regions where these avian Pokémon congregate, such as the fields of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally "held" in the classic sense, but guaranteed to drop from wild **Starly**, **Staravia**, and **Staraptor** upon their defeat in battle or via the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature. It is a common material used to represent the biological remnants of the Pokémon encountered.
