## Identity & Utility
**Rockium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon that knows a Rock-type move, it allows the trainer to trigger a high-powered cinematic attack once per battle. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Special Held Item** that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through the Island Challenge).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon can upgrade any damaging Rock-type move into the Z-Move **Continental Crush**. If the base move is a status move, it instead becomes **Z-Status Move**, granting additional stat boosts or effects (e.g., Z-Sandstorm boosts Speed).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact competitive staple in Generation VII formats (VGC 2017-2019 and Smogon). It is primarily used to bypass the accuracy checks of moves like *Stone Edge* or to provide a massive burst of damage to OHKO defensive threats. It is unique in that it **cannot be removed** by the move *Knock Off* or stolen by *Thief/Covet*, and it is unaffected by the ability *Sticky Hold*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it interacts with the **Z-Ring** (or Z-Power Ring) held by the trainer. It cannot be used if the Pokémon is Mega Evolved or holding another specialized item like a Choice Band.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, the Rockium Z is obtained by the player upon defeating **Olivia**, the Kahuna of Akala Island, during her Grand Trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind key-like item that resides in the Z-Crystals pocket of the bag but functions as a held item in the party menu. 
* **Lore context:** Z-Crystals are said to be shards of **Necrozma**, the Prism Pokémon, scattered across the Alola region and utilized by the people of Alola to commune with the power of nature.
