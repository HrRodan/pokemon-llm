## Identity & Utility
**Fab-Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a "gorgeous, extravagant print" used for social communication between trainers. It is a **Held Item** that is consumed upon the composition of a message but persists as a held object until removed by the recipient. It is a standard, low-cost item available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message using a predetermined list of words and phrases. The Pokémon holding the Fab-Mail carries this message to another player during a trade. Once the message is read, the recipient can erase it to reuse the stationery or store the message in their PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Item Protection:** While holding Mail, a Pokémon **cannot be placed in the PC**. Additionally, the item acts as a "sticky" hold item; moves that remove or steal items, such as **Thief, Covet, Knock Off, or Trick**, will fail against a Pokémon holding Mail.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Obsolete.** While the immunity to item removal was once a very niche strategy to scout moves or prevent *Knock Off* utility, the trade-off of not being able to hold a Stat-boosting or recovery item (like Leftovers) makes it unviable in professional play. It is primarily a social/flavor item for the main story.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a communication tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in various regions (notably in the Hoenn region). In Generation III, it serves as a way for players to personalize trades before the advent of advanced online global communication.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from vendors or found as floor loot in specific extravagance-themed locations.
* **Lore Context:** Fab-Mail is part of a series of collectible stationery (like Bead Mail or Retro Mail) designed to reflect the personality of the sender or the aesthetic of the Pokémon carrying it. Its "extravagant" design suggests it is intended for formal or high-status messages.
