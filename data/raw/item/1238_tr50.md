## Identity & Utility
**TR50 (Leaf Blade)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Leaf Blade**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, representing a return to the classic consumable mechanic for high-tier or high-power moves. It is a **Consumable Machine** that can be purchased through special currency or earned through combat.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). In the Galar region, this value often corresponds to a high price in **Watts** (typically 5,000–8,000 W) when purchased from Wild Area Watt Traders.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Leaf Blade** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Leaf Blade is a physical Grass-type move with 90 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It features an increased critical-hit ratio, making it highly effective on Pokémon with abilities like *Sniper* or those holding a *Scope Lens*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when thrown using the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Viability.** Leaf Blade is the gold standard for physical Grass-type attackers. It is a staple on Pokémon like **Kartana, Sceptile, Sirfetch'd, and Leafeon** due to its perfect accuracy, lack of recoil, and high crit-rate.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is often a "level-up" style move that many Pokémon cannot learn naturally, making the TR essential for optimizing physical sweepers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Galar Wild Area**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** (inventory rotates daily) or received as a reward for defeating **Grass-type Pokémon in Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its availability is tied strictly to the Galar region's raid economy and specialized traders.
* **Context:** TR50 represents a "High-Tier" physical move. In the transition to Generation IX, this item was largely phased out as the series moved back to a unified TM system, making TR50 a distinct artifact of the Galar region's training mechanics.
