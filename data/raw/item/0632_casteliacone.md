## Identity & Utility
**Casteliacone** is a **Consumable Medicine** (Status Cure) introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** A famous regional specialty soft-serve ice cream from Castelia City. It serves as a consumable medical item that can be used from the bag to treat a single Pokémon. It is a one-time use item that functions as a cost-effective alternative to the standard Full Heal.
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/High-Value**). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Completely cures a Pokémon of any primary status ailment (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep) as well as the volatile status condition **Confusion**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough & Nuzlocke Staple.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), manual status-curing consumables are prohibited. However, in Nuzlocke challenges or standard playthroughs, the Casteliacone is highly prized because it provides the exact same utility as a Full Heal (600 Poké Dollars) at nearly half the price.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. As a "food" item, it is flavor-themed but does not interact with abilities like *Ripen* or *Cheek Pouch* (which are exclusive to Berries).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally sold exclusively at the **Casteliacone Stand** on Mode Street in Castelia City. In its debut generation, availability was restricted to specific days of the week or seasons, mimicking the real-world scarcity of popular artisanal treats. In later generations, it can often be found in specialty shops or received from NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not naturally held** by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from specific vendors or found as hidden items in the overworld. Its scarcity in certain titles reinforces its status as a "local specialty" alongside items like the Lava Cookie, Old Gateau, and Lumiose Galette.
