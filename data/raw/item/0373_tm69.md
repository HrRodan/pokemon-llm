## Identity & Utility
**TM69** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A data disc used to instantly teach a move to a compatible Pokémon. In its original and most frequent iteration, it teaches **Rock Polish**. However, as TM numbering is non-static across generations, the data indicates that in the Galar region (Sword/Shield), it transitioned to teaching **Psycho Cut**. It is a **Consumable/Multi-use** item (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that **Can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a Pokémon.
    * **Rock Polish (Standard):** A Rock-type status move that polishes the user's body to drastically raise its **Speed stat by two stages (+2)**.
    * **Psycho Cut (SwSh Variant):** A Physical Psychic-type move that deals damage and has an increased critical-hit ratio.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be Flung for damage in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Rock Polish** is a cornerstone for "Bulky Offense" and "Setup Sweepers." It allows powerful but naturally slow threats (such as Rhyperior, Aggron, or Golem) to double their speed in a single turn, potentially outspeeding the entire unboosted metagame. 
        * **Psycho Cut** is a vital coverage move for physical attackers like Gallade, especially those benefiting from the *Sharpness* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Interaction is limited to Pokémon compatibility lists, which for Rock Polish, typically includes most Rock, Steel, and Ground types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Sinnoh/Johto/Hoenn:** Often purchasable at large Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone or Goldenrod) or found in caves like Mt. Coronet.
    * **Galar:** Found in Route 2.
    * **Paldea:** Craftable via the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is strictly a manufactured human tool for Pokémon development.
* **Context:** TM69's utility shifted significantly in Generation VIII. While it was historically a "setup" move (Rock Polish), its temporary assignment to Psycho Cut provided physical Psychic-type coverage that was otherwise rare for many attackers. In the most recent regions (Paldea), it has returned to its roots as the Rock Polish machine.
