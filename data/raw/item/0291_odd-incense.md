## Identity & Utility
**Odd Incense** is a **Competitive Held Item (Type-Enhancement)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An exotic-smelling incense designed to be held by a Pokémon. It specifically enhances the mental focus of the wearer, boosting the potency of Psychic-type attacks. It is a **Holdable/Consumable (Breeding)** item that can be purchased at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Affordable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, it increases the power of the holder's **Psychic-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is functionally identical to the **Twisted Spoon**. In competitive play (VGC/Smogon), it is considered **Niche**. It is occasionally used on Psychic-type attackers that want a damage boost without the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking of Choice items, particularly in formats where "Item Clause" prevents multiple Pokémon from holding the same item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Breeding (Baby Trigger):** If a **Mr. Mime** (or Mr. Rime) holds this item while in the Day Care or Nursery, the resulting Egg will hatch into a **Mime Jr.** Without this item, the Egg will hatch directly into a Mr. Mime.
    * **Ability Interaction:** Pokémon with the ability **Klutz** cannot benefit from the damage boost.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold by specialized Incense merchants (such as the one in Driftveil City in Unova or Hulbury in Galar) or found in specific locations like the Solaceon Ruins in Sinnoh. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or found as a static overworld item.
* **World Knowledge:** The Odd Incense is part of a series of ritualistic Incense items introduced in Gen III and IV to explain the sudden appearance of "Baby Pokémon" in the wild or through breeding that were not present in previous generations. Among these, the Odd Incense is the essential key to completing the Mr. Mime evolutionary line.
