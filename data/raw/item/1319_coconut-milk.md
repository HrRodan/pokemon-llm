## Identity & Utility
**Coconut Milk** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A culinary component specifically used for cooking at the Pokémon Camp. It is prized for its refined sweetness, making it a popular choice for trainers looking to create specific flavor profiles in their dishes. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased from specialized vendors.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Pokémon Camp's curry-making minigame, it serves as the base ingredient to create various types of **Coconut Milk Curry**. Depending on the berries paired with it, the resulting dish will restore Pokémon HP, PP, and increase Friendship/Experience points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be held for a beneficial effect in battle and provides no stat boosts. Its value is strictly limited to the "Curry Dex" completion and mid-adventure party maintenance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a social/maintenance mechanic item for the Pokémon Camp feature in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased from **Ingredient Sellers** found throughout the **Wild Area**, the Isle of Armor, or the Crown Tundra in the Galar region. It can also occasionally be found as a hidden item (sparkle on the ground) in the Wild Area or received as a reward for successful Max Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held** by any wild Pokémon species. It must be acquired through commerce or exploration of the Galar wilderness. It is a "Refined" ingredient, suggesting it is a processed good rather than a raw material found in nature.
