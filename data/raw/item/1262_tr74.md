## Identity & Utility
**TR74 (Iron Head)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the move **Iron Head**. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are consumed upon use. It represents a "Steel-type physical staple" in a trainer's arsenal.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/Special Acquisition). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for Watts in its debut games.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Iron Head** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Iron Head is a Physical Steel-type move with **80 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. It carries a **30% chance to flinch** the target, provided the user moves first.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. If used with the move Fling, it deals significant physical damage but the item is destroyed without teaching the move.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** Iron Head is the primary Physical Steel-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for heavy hitters like **Excadrill, Zacian-Crowned, and Corviknight**. It is also the core component of "Para-flinch" strategies, particularly when used by Pokémon with the **Serene Grace** ability (like Jirachi), which boosts the flinch chance to a devastating 60%.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Generation VIII specific mechanic where powerful or high-accuracy moves were moved to a consumable "TR" format to encourage Max Raid Battle participation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TR74 is most commonly acquired by trading **Watts** with Watt Traders in the Galar Wild Area. The specific inventory of these traders rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. However, it is a frequent reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Steel-type Pokémon (such as Copperajah, Steelix, or Bisharp) in the Wild Area or Crown Tundra.
