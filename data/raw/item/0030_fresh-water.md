## Identity & Utility
**Fresh Water** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in **Generation I** (metadata updated in Generation III).
* **Description:** A bottle of water with high mineral content used for hydration and recovery. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. It is highly valued for its cost-to-healing ratio compared to standard pharmacy-bought Potions.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores a fixed amount of HP to a single Pokémon. 
    * *Mechanical Variance:* While historically restoring **50 HP** (as noted in the effect entries), it was nerfed to **30 HP** starting in Generation VII (Sun/Moon) to balance early-game healing progression.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in **playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**. Because it is cheaper than a standard Potion (300 Poké Dollars for 20 HP), it is the preferred healing item for efficient resource management during the main story. It has no viable niche in competitive Smogon or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Saffron City Access:** In Generation I games (and their remakes), giving a Fresh Water (or other vending machine drinks) to the thirsty guards is a mandatory story beat to gain access to Saffron City.
    * **Friendship:** Using this item on a Pokémon slightly increases its happiness/friendship.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in **Vending Machines** located on the rooftops of Department Stores (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, Lilycove City) and at various transit hubs like the Battle Subway or Motostoke.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; it is an industrial product rather than a natural resource.
* **World Knowledge:** Fresh Water is the first tier of the "Vending Machine Trio," which includes Soda Pop and Lemonade. It represents the most basic level of beverage-based healing, providing more utility than a Potion for a lower price point, making Vending Machines a priority stop for veteran trainers.
