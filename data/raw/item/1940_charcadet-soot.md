## Identity & Utility
**Charcadet Soot** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clump of soot dropped by the Pokémon Charcadet. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon. Instead, it serves as a specialized currency for the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 160 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Low Value**). While it can be sold, its primary utility is being exchanged for League Points (LP) or used in crafting recipes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs) in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. For example, it is a key component for crafting moves like **TM024 (Fire Spin)** and **TM107 (Will-O-Wisp)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no strategic value in battle. It is strictly an overworld utility item used for team building and movepool customization during the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does **not** trigger evolution. Although Charcadet requires specific items to evolve (Auspicious Armor or Malicious Armor), the Soot is purely for move-crafting.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquired as a drop from defeating or catching members of the Charcadet evolutionary line. It is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a guaranteed drop/material reward from wild **Charcadet**, **Armarouge**, and **Ceruledge**. In the Paldea region, players often farm this item by battling Charcadet found in the South, East, and West Provinces to unlock powerful Fire-type utility moves.
