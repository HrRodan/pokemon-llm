## Identity & Utility
**Psyduck Down** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** An organic material shed by the Psyduck evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used exclusively at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. While it has a nominal sell price, its primary value lies in move acquisition.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Value for exchange into League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). At the TM Machine in Paldean Pokémon Centers, players combine this material with League Points (LP) to "print" moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While the item itself has no competitive battle presence, it is essential for teaching competitive staples to a team. Specifically, Psyduck Down is a required ingredient for:
        * **TM011 (Water Pulse)**
        * **TM022 (Chilling Water)**
        * **TM050 (Rain Dance)**
        * **TM120 (Psychic)**
        * **TM129 (Calm Mind)**
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a standard drop in the Generation IX "Material" ecosystem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquired by defeating or catching members of the Psyduck line in the wild. It is not sold in Poké Marts but can be exchanged for 30 League Points (LP) per unit.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item; it is an automatic reward drop from:
    * **Psyduck**
    * **Golduck**
* **Context:** In the Paldea region, these feathers are noted for being easily found near water sources where Psyduck congregate. Their commonality makes them a "Basic" tier material, though the TMs they produce (like Calm Mind) are high-tier competitive tools.
