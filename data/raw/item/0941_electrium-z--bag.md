## Identity & Utility
**Electrium Z (Bag)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to upgrade a Pokémon's Electric-type moves. In the bag, it acts as a permanent key to unlock the potential for Electric Z-Moves across the party. It is a **Key Item / Non-Consumable** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Unique quest reward; Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Pokémon holds the Electrium Z and knows an Electric-type attacking move, it can use the Z-Move **Gigavolt Havoc**. If the base move is a status move, it transforms into a **Z-Status Move**, granting secondary stat boosts (e.g., Z-Thunder Wave increases Special Defense by one stage) in addition to its normal effects.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are unique items that cannot be lost via the move **Fling**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A meta-defining item in Generation VII competitive play (VGC 2017-2019 and Smogon). Its primary value lies in its high-damage "nuke" potential, allowing Electric types like Tapu Koko or Xurkitree to break through bulky ground or water types.
    * **Item Security:** Pokémon holding a Z-Crystal are immune to the effects of **Knock Off** (damage is not boosted and the item is not removed) and **Trick/Switcheroo**, making them reliable anchors in a team's strategy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is specifically tied to the **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** mechanic held by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the Electrium Z is obtained at the **Hokulani Observatory**. It is awarded to the player by the Trial Captain **Sophocles** after completing his trial (or during the events leading up to it).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique artifact granted to trainers who pass the Island Challenge. It cannot be intercepted or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
