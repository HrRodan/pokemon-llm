## Identity & Utility
**Eevee Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy designed to empower the Eevee evolutionary line. Unlike traditional vitamins that target single stats, this candy provides a comprehensive boost to all attributes simultaneously. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be sold for a small amount, but is primarily earned through gameplay mechanics rather than purchased in bulk at Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by an **Eevee** or any of its **evolutions** (Vaporeon, Jolteon, Flareon), it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by +1 point in the form of **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine where holding items and the move Fling are not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is essential for "Master Trainers" and competitive battles within the *Let's Go* ecosystem, where AVs replace the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. It allows a Pokémon to exceed traditional stat caps, making it vital for optimization in that specific meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is restricted to the Eevee family; it will have no effect if used on unrelated species like Pikachu or Charmander.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by **transferring Eevee** to Professor Oak or by achieving high **Catch Combos** of wild Eevee. It serves as a reward for specialized training and "farming" specific species.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered as a reward for the **Capture Research** mechanic. In the context of the Alola/Kanto *Let's Go* transition, it represents the bond and specialized nutrition provided by a trainer focusing on a specific species.
