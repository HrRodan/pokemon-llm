## Identity & Utility
**Onion** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A culinary staple used during the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable overworld item specifically designed for the Paldean meal-power system. While it cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon, it serves as a foundational component for various Meal Powers.
* **Cost:** 130 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a sandwich topping, the Onion contributes specific flavor profiles and Meal Power points. It primarily provides **Bitter** (12) and **Sweet** (3) flavors.
* **Meal Power Contributions:**
    * **Teensy Power:** High contribution.
    * **Encounter Power:** Moderate contribution.
    * **Exp. Point Power:** Moderate contribution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None in direct combat. However, it is essential for **Meta-Game preparation**, specifically for Shiny Hunting (Sparkling Power) and Leveling (Exp. Power) via the Sandwich mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-relevant abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Readily available for purchase at **Deli Cioso** outlets and **Aquiesta Supermarkets** across the Paldea region. Availability is usually unlocked from the start of the game or after obtaining a few Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon and must be purchased or occasionally found as a sparkling overworld pickup in specific biomes.
* **Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, Onions are part of the vast array of human-grade food items repurposed for Pokémon nutrition and buffing via the Picnic system, replacing the Curry mechanic of the Galar region.
