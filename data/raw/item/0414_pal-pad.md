## Identity & Utility
**Pal Pad** is a **Key Item** (categorized under Gameplay) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A specialized digital notepad used to manage social connections and online interactions. It functions as a directory for registering Friend Codes, allowing players to connect with others via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection (WFC). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as an internal database for up to **32 unique Friend Codes**. For each registered friend, the Pal Pad stores their Trainer sprite, gender, and basic gameplay statistics (such as wins/losses) synced during online interactions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically, this was the **foundational tool** for competitive play in Gen IV and Gen V. Before the introduction of the Player Search System (PSS) or modern matchmaking, the Pal Pad was the only way to facilitate specific competitive battles, trades, and official tournament matches via the Wi-Fi Club. In the modern era, its utility is restricted to legacy hardware and private fan-run servers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. It is a pure UI/Networking utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Sinnoh region (DPPt), it is typically obtained by speaking to the receptionist in the **basement of any Pokémon Center** for the first time. In the Johto (HGSS) and Unova (BW/B2W2) regions, it is gifted to the player as a mandatory story item to unlock multiplayer functionality.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon; it is a unique item tethered to the player's Trainer ID and the console’s internal MAC address/WFC settings.
