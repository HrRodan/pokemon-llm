## Identity & Utility
**Health Candy L** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation VII**, specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!* and *Let’s Go, Eevee!*.
* **Description:** A large, specialized candy used to permanently bolster a Pokémon's physical health. It is a consumable medicine that can be bought or earned, but its usage is restricted to Pokémon of a certain maturity level (Lv. 30+). Within the item hierarchy, the "L" (Large) variant represents the mid-to-high tier of the stat-boosting candy system.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases a Pokémon’s **HP Awakening Values (AVs)**. In the *Let's Go* series, AVs replace the traditional Effort Value (EV) system, allowing a Pokémon to gain massive flat bonuses to their stats (up to +200 in each stat). 
* **Usage Restrictions:** 
    * This specific size (L) can only be administered to Pokémon that are **Level 30 or higher**.
    * It cannot be used once the Pokémon's HP AVs have reached a certain threshold (usually requires switching to XL candies for the final points).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move *Fling* is not present in the games where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. It is essential for "No Restrictions" or "Candy-enabled" battles in the *Let's Go* meta, where stats can be significantly inflated compared to standard competitive formats. It is irrelevant for standard VGC or Smogon formats which use the EV/IV system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a stat-enhancement tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Health Candy L is primarily acquired by catching wild Pokémon that naturally have high HP (such as Chansey, Snorlax, or Nidoran♂/♀). 
* **Farming Methods:**
    * **Catch Combos:** Achieving high catch combos of HP-focused Pokémon increases the drop rate of Large Candies.
    * **Professor Oak:** Players receive these candies as rewards for "sending Pokémon to the Professor" (releasing them from the Pokémon Box).
    * **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking with a Pokémon in the Poké Ball Plus accessory can generate various candies, including Health Candy L.
* **World Context:** Unlike traditional Vitamins (like HP Up), which are manufactured in labs, Candies in the Kanto/Alola transition period represent a more "organic" way of strengthening Pokémon through catching and research rewards.
