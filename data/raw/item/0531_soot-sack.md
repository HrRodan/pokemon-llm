## Identity & Utility
**Soot Sack** is a **gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized container designed to automatically collect volcanic ash as the trainer walks through the ash-covered tall grass of Hoenn's Route 113. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While in the player's inventory, the sack tracks the amount of volcanic ash collected. Ash is gathered by walking or running through the "deep ash" (tall grass) on Route 113. The accumulated soot acts as a unique currency that can be traded at the **Glass Workshop** for rare items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item strictly for overworld collection and side-quest progression.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The Soot Sack is the primary engine for obtaining **Flutes**. By collecting specific amounts of ash (steps), players can exchange the soot for:
    * **Blue Flute** (250 steps): Awakens sleeping Pokémon.
    * **Yellow Flute** (500 steps): Snaps a Pokémon out of confusion.
    * **Red Flute** (500 steps): Snaps a Pokémon out of attraction.
    * **White Flute** (1000 steps): Increases wild Pokémon encounter rate.
    * **Black Flute** (1000 steps): Decreases wild Pokémon encounter rate.
    * **Pretty Chair/Desk** (6000+ steps): Secret Base decorations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained for free from the owner of the **Glass Workshop on Route 113** in the Hoenn region (Pokémon Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, and their remakes Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool provided to the player to assist with the environmental hazards of the volcanic region near Mt. Chimney.
