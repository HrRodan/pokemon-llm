## Identity & Utility
**Aguav Berry** is a **Consumable Medicine / Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
*   **Description:** A bitter-tasting berry that serves as a reactive healing tool. It is a **holdable-active** item intended for use in battle, though it can be manually administered. It is part of the "Pinch Berry" family (alongside Figy, Wiki, Mago, and Iapapa).
*   **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP falls below **50% (1/2)** of its maximum, the Pokémon consumes the berry to restore **12.5% (1/8)** of its max HP. 
*   **The "Picky" Mechanic:** If the Pokémon has a Nature that dislikes **Bitter** flavors (specifically Natures that decrease **Special Defense**: **Naughty, Lax, Rash, and Naive**), it will become **Confused** after consuming the berry.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the berry's healing/confusion effect on the target).
    *   **Natural Gift:** When used with Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dragon-type** move with 60 to 80 Power (depending on the Generation).
    *   **Competitive Use:** Known as a "Pinch Berry." While it saw massive usage in Generation VII when it restored 50% HP, its current iteration is more niche. It is used on bulky Pokémon to reach specific survival benchmarks, provided the trainer ensures the Pokémon's Nature does not conflict with the Bitter flavor.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution but interacts with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles the healing), **Gluttony** (makes the Pokémon eat it at 50% HP regardless of the Gen), and **Harvest** (allows for repeated consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Commonly found in Berry patches throughout the Hoenn, Sinnoh, and Kalos regions. It is often sold at specialized Berry shops or the Pokémon League for a low price.
*   **Wild Held Item:** While not listed as held by common wild Pokémon in this dataset, it is frequently gathered by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability in mid-to-high level tiers.
*   **Lore:** Its name and shape are derived from the **Guava**. It is notoriously bitter, making it a "high-risk/high-reward" item for trainers who do not pay attention to their Pokémon's flavor preferences.
