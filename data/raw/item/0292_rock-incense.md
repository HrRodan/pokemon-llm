## Identity & Utility
**Rock Incense** is a **Type-Enhancement** held item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An exotic-smelling incense designed to be held by a Pokémon. It serves a dual purpose: enhancing the offensive capabilities of Rock-type techniques and acting as a physiological trigger for specific Pokémon breeding. It is a **Holdable Consumable/Multi-use** item that can typically be purchased at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Affordable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, it increases the power of the holder's **Rock-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no additional secondary effects when used with the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. In competitive play (Smogon/VGC), it is functionally identical to the **Hard Stone**. It is generally outclassed by items with higher damage ceilings like **Life Orb** or **Choice Band**, but it is useful in specific formats where an item clause prevents duplicate items or when the player wants to avoid recoil damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding (Baby Trigger):** This is a mandatory item for obtaining **Bonsly**. When a **Sudowoodo** (or another Bonsly/Sudowoodo) is placed in the Day Care or Nursery while holding Rock Incense, the resulting Egg will hatch into a **Bonsly**. Without this item, the Egg will hatch directly into a Sudowoodo.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at specialized "Incense Stalls" found in major marketplaces (e.g., Slateport City, Driftveil City, or Hulbury). It is also frequently found as a hidden item in mountainous or rocky terrain (such as Fuego Ironworks in Sinnoh).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically found** on wild Pokémon, making it a "specialty purchase" or "overworld find" rather than a farmable resource through the Pickup ability or Thief mechanics.
* **Lore context:** Incense items like the Rock Incense were introduced to explain why certain Baby Pokémon (like Bonsly) weren't discovered in earlier generations despite their evolved forms being known.
