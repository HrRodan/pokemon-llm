## Identity & Utility
**TR25 (Psyshock)** is a **Technical Record** (Consumable Machine) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon the move **Psyshock**. Unlike traditional TMs in the Galar region, TRs (Technical Records) break after one use, mirroring the behavior of classic TMs from earlier generations. It is a high-value consumable specifically designed for tactical offensive coverage.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Mid-tier pricing). In the context of the Galar economy, it is often traded for **Watts** rather than standard currency at specialized vendors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psyshock** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Psyshock is a Psychic-type Special move with 80 Base Power. 
    * **Unique Mechanic:** While the move is categorized as "Special," it calculates damage based on the **target's Physical Defense** stat rather than its Special Defense.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Competitive / Staple.** Psyshock is essential for Special Attackers (e.g., Alakazam, Mew, Latios) to bypass "Special Walls" like **Blissey** or **Chansey**, who have massive Special Defense but very low Physical Defense.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time teaching tool that expands a Pokémon's movepool to handle defensive threats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily acquired in the **Galar region**. It is frequently found as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** against Psychic-type Pokémon. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000 to 5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an engineered item found through exploration, raid participation, or high-level currency exchange.
* **Lore Context:** The return of single-use machines (TRs) in Gen VIII alongside infinite-use TMs created a dual-tier system where "move-teaching records" represent more powerful or strategically complex techniques compared to standard TMs.
