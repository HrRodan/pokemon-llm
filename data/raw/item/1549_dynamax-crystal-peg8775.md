## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (★Peg8775)** is a **Special Event Consumable** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** A rare crystal that emits a specific frequency to attract a giant Pokémon. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle encounter. It is a single-use event item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; practically **Not for Sale** as it is an event-exclusive distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area) while carrying this item, it initiates a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **★Peg8775** crystal summons a **Larvitar** encounter. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item used to encounter Pokémon. However, the resulting Raid Pokémon often features high Individual Values (IVs) and the potential for a Hidden Ability, making it a valuable source for breeding competitive-ready Tyranitar.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item is consumed upon use. The encounter persists only until the end of the day (midnight) on which the crystal was activated. If the player loses the raid, they can re-challenge it as long as the day hasn't ended.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **unique serial codes** as part of promotional events. Specifically, the ★Peg8775 crystal was a pre-order bonus or retail giveaway (such as through Target in the US or various retailers in Europe) to allow players to catch Larvitar in *Pokémon Sword* (where it is normally a *Shield* exclusive) or early in *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Dynamax Crystal," a subset of items designed specifically to interface with the Max Raid mechanic of the Galar region. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which summon random encounters at any den, Dynamax Crystals summon fixed species at a specific location.
