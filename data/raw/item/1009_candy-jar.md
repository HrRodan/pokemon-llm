## Identity & Utility
**Candy Jar** is an **Unused/Scrapped Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the data for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** Within the game's internal code, it is categorized as an "unused" item with no associated flavor text. Based on its name and the mechanics of the *Let's Go* series, it was likely intended to be a **Key Item** designed to store or organize the various "Stat Candies" (such as Quick Candy or Mighty Candy) used to increase Awakening Values (AVs). 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unobtainable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** None. The item has no functional code or effect entries in the final release of the games. It exists solely as a placeholder or a remnant of a discarded storage mechanic.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item does not exist in any legal competitive format (VGC or Smogon) and cannot be acquired through normal gameplay.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** No known interactions with Pokémon evolution or abilities. It was superseded by the standard "Candy Jar" functionality being integrated directly into the Bag's UI in the *Let's Go* games.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** It cannot be found in Marts, as hidden items, or through special events. It remains hidden within the game's internal data.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Contextual Lore:** In the *Let's Go* series, the "Candy" system replaced the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. Players would often accumulate hundreds of candies from catching Pokémon. While the "Candy Jar" item was cut, the final games simply allowed players to manage these candies directly from a dedicated pocket in the Bag, rendering a specific "Jar" item redundant.
