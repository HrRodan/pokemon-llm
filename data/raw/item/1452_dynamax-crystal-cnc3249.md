## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CNC3249)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that technically has a nominal cost but is not available through standard in-game retail.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**; generally obtained via serial codes or promotional distributions rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is triggered. This allows the player to challenge a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon (defined by the crystal's ID—in this case, often associated with promotional Gigantamax encounters like Corviknight or Centiskorch depending on the specific distribution). The raid remains active until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct application in trainer battles. Its value lies entirely in the "overworld" mechanic of facilitating rare Max Raid Battles to obtain Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but is the primary method for encountering certain Gigantamax-capable species during limited-time events.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as **promotional tie-ins** (e.g., pre-order bonuses, retail serial codes, or official guidebook inserts). It is not available in Poké Marts or through standard gameplay progression.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these crystals are unique digital keys tied to the player's inventory and cannot be farmed using the **Pickup** ability or **Thief**.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals concentrate Galar particles into a specific location to force a Pokémon to Dynamax, bypassing the natural "rolling" of dens in the Wild Area.
