## Identity & Utility
**Brittle Bones** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized cooking component used exclusively during Pokémon Camp. When boiled, it releases a light umami flavor into the dish. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that can be purchased from specific vendors but serves no direct healing or buffing purpose outside of the Curry-making mini-game.
* **Cost:** 950 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a base ingredient to create various types of Curry (specifically the **Bone Curry** family) in the Curry Dex. The quality of the curry produced depends on the berries added alongside these bones and the player's performance in the cooking mini-game. Successful cooking restores a Pokémon's HP and PP, grants Experience Points, and increases Friendliness/Sociability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item cannot be held for any tactical advantage in battle and is strictly restricted to the "Curry Dex" completion and camp mechanics.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-specific abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way. It is purely a culinary item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primary sources include the **Ingredient Sellers** located throughout the Galar **Wild Area** (such as at the Entrance or Rolling Fields), whose stock rotates daily. It can also be found as a hidden item (sparkle) on the ground in various Wild Area sub-regions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike other bone-themed items (like Rare Bone or Thick Club), Brittle Bones are treated as a commodity for human/Pokémon consumption rather than a tool or treasure.
