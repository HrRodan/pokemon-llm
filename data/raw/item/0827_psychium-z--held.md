## Identity & Utility
**Psychium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power. When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Psychic-type move, it allows the trainer to trigger a powerful Z-Move once per battle. As a Z-Crystal, it is a **Held Item** that is fundamentally tied to the trainer's Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring and **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through trial completion or exploration).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder knows a damaging Psychic-type move, this crystal upgrades it to the Z-Move **Shattered Psyche**. The power of Shattered Psyche scales based on the base power of the original move. If the holder knows a Psychic-type status move (e.g., *Hypnosis* or *Trick Room*), the crystal allows the use of a **Z-Status move**, adding secondary effects such as stat boosts or HP restoration.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A. Z-Crystals are unique; they **cannot be used with Fling**, and they cannot be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief*, or swapped by *Trick/Switcheroo*.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact item in Generation VII competitive formats (VGC 2017-2019 and SM Smogon). It is often used to bypass defensive checks by providing a massive "nuke" of damage. Notable users include **Tapu Lele** and **Alakazam**. It is also used for utility, such as *Z-Hypnosis* (which boosts Speed) or *Z-Mirror Coat* (which boosts Special Defense).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a battle-mechanic item. It interacts with the **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** in the trainer's Key Items pocket.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the Psychium Z is typically obtained in the **Aether House** on Ula'ula Island after defeating the Trial Captain Acerola.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind treasure and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or other item-gathering methods. 
* **Lore Context:** Z-Crystals are said to be shards of **Necrozma**, the Prism Pokémon, scattered across the Alola region as "shining stones" that empower the bond between trainer and Pokémon.
