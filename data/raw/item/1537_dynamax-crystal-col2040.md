## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (col2040)** is a specialized **Event Item** (categorized as a Dynamax Crystal) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This item functions as a beacon for the Max Raid Battle mechanic. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Ruined Watchtower of the Galar Wild Area), it forces a specific Pokémon encounter to spawn in a Max Raid Den. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that disappears upon the successful triggering of the raid.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a internal price value, it cannot be purchased from standard in-game Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, it causes a specific Pokémon (designated by the internal ID `col2040`) to appear as a Dynamax boss. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is **critically important for competitive prep**. These crystals were often distributed via serial codes (e.g., via retail partnerships or pre-orders) to give players early or exclusive access to **Gigantamax-capable Pokémon** or Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities** otherwise difficult to find in the Wild Area.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environmental node in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Exclusive** item. It was not obtainable through natural gameplay but was distributed through **Serial Codes** or special promotions (such as the Pokémon Sword & Shield Expansion Pass pre-orders or magazine distributions). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is strictly an inventory-based "key" to unlock specific raid content.
* **Contextual Note:** In the hierarchy of Galar items, Dynamax Crystals represent a bridge between the physical world and the Max Raid ecosystem, allowing players to bypass the RNG (Random Number Generation) of standard Wishing Pieces to target a specific encounter.
