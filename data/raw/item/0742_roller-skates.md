## Identity & Utility
**Roller Skates** is a **Gameplay / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** This item attaches roller skates to the user's footwear, allowing for high-speed traversal and the execution of specialized tricks. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold; it is a permanent inventory fixture once acquired.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates "off-the-grid" movement. While traditional movement is restricted to a four-directional grid, the Roller Skates allow for 360-degree analog movement using the 3DS Circle Pad. They significantly increase movement speed over walking and allow the player to traverse "grind rails" found throughout the Kalos region.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This is strictly a movement utility for the overworld and has no impact on competitive Pokémon battles or stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. However, it features a unique progression system where the player can learn various "Skating Tricks" (such as the 360, the Backflip, and the Cosmic Flip) from NPCs in Lumiose City to improve overworld flair and reach specific areas.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in **Pokémon X and Y**. The player receives them automatically after defeating a Roller Skater located outside the **Santalune City Gym**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. Unlike the Bicycle, which is a staple across most regions, the Roller Skates are a regional specialty of Kalos, emphasizing the region's focus on style and modern urban movement. They are automatically equipped whenever the player uses the Circle Pad for movement.
