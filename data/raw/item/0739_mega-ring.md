## Identity & Utility
**Mega Ring** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized piece of jewelry containing a Key Stone. It acts as the primary conduit between a Trainer and a Pokémon holding a compatible Mega Stone. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold; it is a permanent addition to the inventory once acquired.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the Trainer the ability to trigger **Mega Evolution** once per battle. For the process to succeed, the active Pokémon must be holding its specific Mega Stone (e.g., Lucarionite) and have a strong bond with the Trainer.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Defining Staple.** While the ring itself resides in the "Key Items" pocket and does not take up a held item slot, it is the mechanical prerequisite for Mega Evolution, which dominated the competitive landscape of Generations VI and VII (VGC and Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger permanent evolution. Instead, it facilitates a **temporary, mid-battle transformation** that alters the Pokémon's stats, typing, and abilities. It is the "Key Stone" counterpart to the "Mega Stone" held by the Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Kalos region, the Mega Ring is obtained at the **Tower of Mastery** in Shalour City. The player must defeat Successor Korrina in a battle to prove their worthiness to wield it. In later games, the "Mega Ring" functionality is often replaced by regional variants like the Mega Bracelet (ORAS) or integrated into the Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring (Gen VII).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is a unique tool granted to humans to harness the energy of the Bond Phenomenon and Mega Stones. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or stolen via **Thief**.
