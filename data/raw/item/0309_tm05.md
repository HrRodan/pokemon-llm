## Identity & Utility
**TM05** is a **Technical Machine** that has been a staple of the series since Generation I.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to permanently teach a move to a compatible Pokémon. Throughout the majority of the series (Generations II through VII), this TM teaches the move **Roar**. In Generation I, it taught **Mega Kick**, and in the most recent iterations (Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), the move associated with TM05 has been updated to **Rest**. It is a **Consumable** item in most generations, though it was infinite-use between Gen V and Gen VII.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its high utility in strategic and competitive play.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Roar** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Logic:** Roar is a status move with -6 priority. It forces the target to switch out for a random ally. In wild encounters, it ends the battle immediately if used by the player, or forces the player to flee if used by a wild Pokémon of a higher level.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Phazing).** Roar is a quintessential "phazing" (pseudo-hazing) move. It is used in competitive singles to force out "setup sweepers" that have accumulated stat boosts and to rack up chip damage from entry hazards like Stealth Rock, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** TM05 (Roar) is particularly effective on defensive "walls" and "tanks" such as Hippowdon, Skarmory, and Suicune.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Marts:** Usually available for purchase in late-game department stores (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove) for 50,000 Poké Dollars.
    * **Overworld:** Often found in locations associated with caves or aggressive wildlife, such as Route 213 (Sinnoh) or Fuego Ironworks.
    * **Crafting:** In Generation IX, it is part of the TM Machine system, requiring specific Pokémon materials (typically from Pokémon that naturally learn Rest, such as Drowzee or Pineco, depending on the game version's move assignment).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found, gifted by an NPC, or purchased.
