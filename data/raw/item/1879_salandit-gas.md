## Identity & Utility
**Salandit Gas** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A material dropped by Salandit or Salazzle after being defeated or caught in the wild. It represents a biological byproduct of the Pokémon's toxic fire-generating capabilities. It is a **Consumable Resource** that cannot be used in battle or held by a Pokémon; it is primarily intended for use at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource Material). When exchanged at the TM Machine, it typically yields a small amount of League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific crafting ingredient for creating TMs (Technical Machines) in the Paldea region. It is combined with League Points (LP) and other Pokémon-sourced materials to manufacture permanent move-teaching discs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly restricted to the **Team Building** phase, allowing players to teach competitive moves (such as *Sludge Bomb* or *Nasty Plot*, depending on specific TM recipes) to their Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is categorized strictly as a crafting reagent and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way beyond being a post-battle drop.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop from the **Salandit evolutionary line**. It is added to the inventory immediately after a successful battle or capture in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Salandit** and **Salazzle**. Trainers looking to farm this material should search in caves, rocky environments, and volcanic biomes where these Pokémon are indigenous. It is often farmed efficiently using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature.
