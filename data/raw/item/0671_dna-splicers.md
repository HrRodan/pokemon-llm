## Identity & Utility
**DNA Splicers** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V** (specifically *Pokémon Black 2 & White 2*).
* **Description:** A specialized scientific tool used to fuse Kyurem with either Reshiram or Zekrom. It represents the restoration of the "Original Dragon" of the Unova region. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, it allows the player to select **Kyurem** and then either **Reshiram** or **Zekrom** to fuse them.
    *   **Kyurem + Reshiram** = **White Kyurem** (Special Attack oriented).
    *   **Kyurem + Zekrom** = **Black Kyurem** (Physical Attack oriented).
    *   Using the item again on the fused form will **split** the Pokémon back into their original individual forms.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** While the item itself is not "held" in battle, it is the sole gateway to using **White Kyurem** and **Black Kyurem**. These forms are significantly more powerful than base Kyurem, possessing a Base Stat Total (BST) of 700 and unique signature moves (Ice Burn/Fusion Flare for White; Freeze Shock/Fusion Bolt for Black).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a **Form-Change** mechanic. The fusion inherits the IVs, Nature, and Shiny status of the base Kyurem. Reshiram or Zekrom effectively "disappears" into the fusion and cannot be used separately while the fusion is active.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (*Black 2 & White 2*), it is found in the **Giant Chasm** after the player captures Kyurem following the main story. In subsequent generations, it is typically provided by NPC "Bargain" dealers or special researchers (e.g., the market dealer in Stow-on-Side in *Sword & Shield* or the Porto Marinada auction in *Scarlet & Violet*) once the player has a Kyurem in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact tied to Unovian legend, theorized to be the physical remains of the dragon that split apart centuries ago.
