## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Uma4554** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it summons a particular Pokémon for a raid encounter that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; the nominal cost is a placeholder for event-only items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to activate a red beam. This triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter (typically featuring a Pokémon like Gigantamax Sandaconda or another event-specific species). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly used for overworld encounter generation to facilitate the capture of rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The crystal is unique to **Pokémon Sword and Shield**. Once the raid is activated, the player has until midnight of the same day to defeat and capture the Pokémon. If the player loses the battle, they can retry as long as the day hasn't ended.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** or special mystery gift events (e.g., through retailers like GameStop, Best Buy, or GAME). It is not available through any in-game Mart or NPC shop.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is an external event-triggering tool rather than an item found within the natural Pokémon ecosystem.
* **Location Context:** Its sole purpose is tied to the **Watchtower Lair**, a specific location in the Wild Area designed to be "recharged" by these crystals, as it otherwise remains inactive during normal gameplay.
