## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Bottle** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized cosmetic accessory used to customize the player's picnic setup. It serves as a visual replacement for the standard condiment bottle on the picnic table. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Aesthetic** item that can be bought at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Mid-range accessibility**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player initiates a Picnic, the Yellow Bottle changes the visual appearance of the condiment containers on the table. It provides no mechanical bonuses to Sandwich making (Meal Powers) or Pokémon stats.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic item for the overworld "Picnic" feature and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-game trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities. It is strictly tied to the Gen IX customization engine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased primarily at **Picnic Knacks** stores located in major Paldean hubs (such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). Unlike ingredients, which are consumed, bottles are typically permanent unlocks for the picnic interface.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It must be purchased through the Paldean retail economy.
