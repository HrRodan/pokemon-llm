## Identity & Utility
**TM163 (Meteor Beam)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk DLC)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach the move **Meteor Beam** to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard shops; requires crafting with League Points and specific Pokémon materials).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Meteor Beam**. This is a powerful, two-turn Special Rock-type move. 
    * **Turn 1:** The user gathers energy and raises its **Special Attack** stat by one stage.
    * **Turn 2:** The user deals damage with a base power of 120 and 90% accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot effectively be used with Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** Meteor Beam is a premier choice for Special Attackers requiring Rock-type coverage. It is almost exclusively paired with the **Power Herb** held item, allowing the Pokémon to gain the +1 Special Attack boost and fire off a 120-power nuke in a single turn. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like **Glimmora**, **Archaludon**, and various Rock-type special attackers in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Technical Machine" system where the item is consumed upon use but can be remade if the player has the necessary ingredients.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available within the **Terarium (Blueberry Academy)** in the *Indigo Disk* expansion. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground or obtained as a reward for Blueberry Quest (BBQ) milestones or specific NPC interactions.
* **Crafting Recipe:** Once unlocked, it can be crafted at any TM Machine using:
    * **8,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **Minior Core x2**
    * **Glimmet Crystal x3**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; acquisition is strictly through overworld discovery or crafting via materials gathered from wild **Minior** and **Glimmet**.
