## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 10** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** This item serves as a specialized record-keeping tool for the Pokéathlon. It specifically tracks and displays the number of times the Trainer has secured first place in the **Snow Throw** mini-game. It is a **Key Item-style collectible** that cannot be used in battle or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In-game, these cards are typically acquired using Athlete Points (AP) at the Pokéathlon Dome rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and archives the player's victories in the Pokéathlon's **Snow Throw** event. Once obtained, the data is updated automatically and can be viewed to track progress toward Pokéathlon completion.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in the Fling move).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely cosmetic/stat-tracking item used for side-activity progression and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle-relevant abilities like Pickup or Klutz. It is strictly a "Key Item" for the Pokéathlon sub-game.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (located in the Johto region in Gen IV). It is one of 27 Data Cards used to fill the Data Card Case, allowing completionists to prove their mastery over various athletic events.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique reward item intended for the Trainer's personal inventory.
* **World Knowledge:** The **Snow Throw** is a Power and Skill-based mini-game where the player's team of three Pokémon engages in a snowball fight against other teams. Data Card 10 is the specific "trophy" card for this event, essential for players aiming to reach the "Master" rank in the Pokéathlon records.
