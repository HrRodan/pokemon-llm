## Identity & Utility
**Destiny Knot** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A long, thin, bright red string designed to be held by a Pokémon during battle or breeding. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that creates a symbiotic link between the holder and its opponent or mate. 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; accessible mid-to-late game in most regions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect (Battle):** If the holder becomes **Infatuated** (under the effect of the move *Attract* or the ability *Cute Charm*), the opponent that caused the status condition also becomes Infatuated, provided they are of the opposite gender. 
* **Primary Effect (Breeding - World Knowledge):** Since Generation VI, the Destiny Knot is a cornerstone of competitive play. If held by either parent in the Pokémon Day Care or Nursery, the offspring is guaranteed to inherit **five Individual Values (IVs)** from its parents' combined pool of twelve, instead of the standard three.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; generally a waste of the item in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** In battle, it is considered **Niche/Gimmick** due to the rarity of *Attract* in high-level play. However, in the metagame of **Breeding**, it is a **Mandatory Staple** for producing "Flawless" or 5-6 IV Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is one of the most targeted items for players using the **Pickup** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually purchased at specialized shops (like the Battle Frontier or BP Shops) or given by NPCs related to beauty or relationships (e.g., the couple in Sea Mauville or Lumiose City). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon species. However, it is a high-tier reward for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability (starting from Level 11+ in some games, but usually Level 51+).
* **World Knowledge:** The "Red String" is a reference to the East Asian "Red Thread of Fate," a myth regarding an invisible cord that connects those who are destined to meet or be together, which mirrors its utility in both infatuation and breeding.
