## Identity & Utility
**TM142 (Hydro Steam)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that imparts the move **Hydro Steam** to compatible Pokémon. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be reproduced using the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or specialized crafting using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hydro Steam**.
    * **Move Type:** Water | **Category:** Special | **Power:** 80 | **Accuracy:** 100%.
    * **Unique Mechanic:** Unlike standard Water-type moves, which have their power reduced by 50% in Harsh Sunlight, Hydro Steam's power is **increased by 50%** during Sun. This makes it the premier Water-type move for "Sun Teams."
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be utilized effectively via Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Relevance.** This TM is essential for **Walking Wake** (its signature move) and specific Water-types used on Sun-based weather teams in VGC and Smogon formats. It allows a team to maintains Water-type offensive pressure even while the sun is active, countering Fire-types that usually thrive in that weather.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily compatible with Walking Wake and select other Pokémon via specific distribution or move-pool expansions in the Blueberry Academy dex.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item within the **Terarium** of the Blueberry Academy (specifically in the Savannah Biome or as a reward for Blueberry Quests). 
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once obtained, it can be crafted at a TM Machine for:
    * **10,000 LP**
    * **5 Finizen Mucus**
    * **3 Veluza Fillets**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The materials required for crafting must be farmed from wild **Finizen** and **Veluza** in the Paldean seas or the Terarium.
