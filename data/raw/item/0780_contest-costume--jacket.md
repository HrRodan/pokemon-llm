## Identity & Utility
**Contest Costume (Jacket)** is a Gameplay/Key Item introduced in **Generation VII** (though associated mechanically with the Generation VI remakes, *Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*).
* **Description:** A "very cool suit" designed specifically for the male protagonist to wear during the **Contest Spectacular**. It is a specialized Key Item that is used automatically when participating in contests and cannot be bought, sold, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a cosmetic transformation for the player character. When entering a Pokémon Contest Spectacular, the player character switches from their standard adventuring gear into this formal jacket to match the prestige of the event.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. It has no impact on competitive Pokémon battling (VGC/Smogon) or the mechanical scoring of the contests themselves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution and does not interact with any Pokémon abilities (such as Pickup or Klutz).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, this item is obtained as a gift from the Contest Idol **Lisia** in Slateport City. It is provided to the male player character to ensure they are properly dressed for their debut in the Master Rank or general contest circuit.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique player-bound item and is never found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
