## Identity & Utility
**Scanner** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized electronic device designed to search for life-forms underwater. Despite its high-tech appearance, the flavor text notes it "looks too difficult to use" for the player, rendering it non-functional as a tool. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Scanner serves as a tradeable quest item. It can be delivered to **Captain Stern** in Slateport City in exchange for one of two powerful evolutionary items: the **Deep Sea Tooth** or the **Deep Sea Scale**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for progression and obtaining evolution-inducing held items for Clamperl.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the Scanner itself does not evolve Pokémon, it is the primary gateway to evolving **Clamperl**.
    * Trading for the **Deep Sea Tooth** allows Clamperl to evolve into **Huntail** (when traded while holding the item).
    * Trading for the **Deep Sea Scale** allows Clamperl to evolve into **Gorebyss** (when traded while holding the item).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found deep within the **Abandoned Ship** (RSE) or **Sea Mauville** (ORAS) in the Hoenn region. Access typically requires the use of the HM/Move **Dive** to explore the submerged basement sections of the wreckage.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique environmental find tied to the Hoenn region's maritime history.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents a piece of salvaged technology from a sunken vessel. Captain Stern’s interest in the device highlights his role as the region's leading oceanic researcher and shipbuilder.
