## Identity & Utility
**Wooden Crown** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically the Crown Tundra expansion of the Galar region).
* **Description:** Described as a mysterious, chipped wooden object that appears to be a component of a larger structure. In the context of the world, it is a relic associated with the "King of Bountiful Harvests." It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Wooden Crown serves as a mandatory narrative trigger. When placed upon the statue of the "King of Bountiful Harvests" in the village of Freezington, it facilitates the appearance and eventual restoration of the Legendary Pokémon **Calyrex**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for story progression and the acquisition of a Legendary Pokémon; it has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon in the traditional sense, it is the catalyst for the "The King of Bountiful Harvests" questline, leading to the player's ability to catch Calyrex and its steeds (Glastrier or Spectrier).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within **Peony’s cabin** in Freezington. In a humorous world-building detail, Peony unknowingly uses the sacred relic as a makeshift pillow or "wooden crown" decoration for his home before the player identifies its true purpose.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-time acquisition provided during the DLC campaign.
