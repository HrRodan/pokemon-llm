## Identity & Utility
**Roto-Stick** (internally identified as the precursor to **Roto Stealth**) is a **Gameplay** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** This item represents a specialized "Rotom Power" granted by the Rotom Dex. It is a **Consumable** utility item that is held in the standard Items pocket but **cannot be bought** or sold at Poké Marts. It functions as a high-tier enhancement to the standard Repel mechanic.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a special acquisition obtained through the Roto Loto mini-game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag, it prevents wild Pokémon from appearing for a set period (similar to a Super or Max Repel), regardless of the level of the lead Pokémon in the player's party. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a strictly overworld utility item used to facilitate travel and avoid interruptions during story progression or shiny hunting (to reach a specific location). It has no impact on trainer-vs-trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of the many "Roto Powers" that utilize the Rotom Dex’s energy to assist the player in the Alola region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through traditional retail. It is exclusively obtained via the **Roto Loto** feature on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS. When the Rotom Dex’s eyes flash gold, the player can "spin" for a random Roto Power; Roto-Stick/Stealth is one of the possible results.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital/energy-based manifestation provided by the player's Rotom Dex companion, emphasizing the bond between the trainer and their Pokédex.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of "Repel" effects, Roto-Stick is superior because it ignores the level-check typically required for Repels to function, making it useful even if the player is leading with a low-level Pokémon.
