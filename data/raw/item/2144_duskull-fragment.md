## Identity & Utility
**Duskull Fragment** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A fragment dropped by members of the Duskull evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting resource used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) to create specific TMs. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold, though its primary value lies in move creation.
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Material Value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient for crafting Technical Machines. Players combine these fragments with League Points (LP) to manufacture moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle; has no Fling power or effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Direct)**. While the item itself provides no tactical advantage in battle, it is vital for the **Preparation Phase** of competitive play, allowing trainers to teach essential moves to their team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Duskull**, **Dusclops**, or **Dusknoir**. It is commonly found in regions where Ghost-types congregate, such as the land of Kitakami (Timeless Woods) or the Blueberry Academy's Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but rather a guaranteed or high-probability drop awarded upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Duskull line. It is a core part of the "Let's Go!" auto-battle farming loop.
