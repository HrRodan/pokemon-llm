## Identity & Utility
**X Accuracy 6** is a **Miracle-Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized battle consumable that immensely raises a Pokémon's accuracy during a fight. Unlike standard battle items, this specific variant is tied exclusively to the **Wonder Launcher** (Miracle Shooter) mechanic. It cannot be bought in shops and does not persist in the player's permanent inventory for overworld use.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired during battle by accumulating points over time within the Wonder Launcher system.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon in battle, it raises the target’s **Accuracy stat by six stages**. This effectively maximizes the Pokémon's accuracy, making even low-accuracy moves (like Zap Cannon or Dynamic Punch) virtually guaranteed to hit, barring evasion modifiers or semi-invulnerable states (like Fly or Dig).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Obsolete/Niche.** This item was only usable in "Wonder Launcher" style battles in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. It is not permitted in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as those formats prohibit the use of external items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on evolution. Its effects are temporary and wear off immediately if the Pokémon is withdrawn from battle (switched out) or if the battle ends.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available through the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic in Generation V multiplayer battles. Players must wait for their "Point" gauge to reach the required level during the match to select and "buy" this boost for their active Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon** and cannot be gathered via the Pickup ability, as it is a digital/energy-based construct of the Unova region's advanced battle technology.
