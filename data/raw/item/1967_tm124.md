## Identity & Utility
**TM124 (Ice Spinner)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This Technical Machine allows a Pokémon to learn the move **Ice Spinner**. It is a consumable item that, as of Generation IX, is single-use but can be reproduced if the player has the necessary materials. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, this item is acquired through exploration or crafted at a Technical Machine Machine (TMM) using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Ice Spinner**, a Physical Ice-type move with a Base Power of 80 and 100% Accuracy.
* **Secondary Mechanics:** 
    * **Terrain Removal:** The primary utility of the move taught by TM124 is its ability to **remove any active terrain** (Electric, Grassy, Misty, or Psychic Terrain) from the battlefield upon impact.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs in Generation IX cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility / Meta-Dependent.** Ice Spinner is a premier coverage move for physical attackers who lack reliable Ice-type STAB. It is a critical strategic tool in both VGC and Smogon formats to disrupt "Terrain Teams" (such as those utilizing Indeedee-F’s Psychic Surge or Rillaboom’s Grassy Surge).
