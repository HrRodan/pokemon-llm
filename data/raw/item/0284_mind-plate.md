## Identity & Utility
**Mind-Plate** is a **Competitive Held Item (Plate)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with Psychic power. It is a holdable item that remains active in battle to enhance specific elemental affinities. While it has a listed cost, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is considered a specialized artifact.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Specialized Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the power of the holder’s **Psychic-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Multitype Interaction:** When held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (specifically **Arceus**), the holder’s type changes to Psychic. Consequently, the move **Judgment** also becomes Psychic-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High base damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While generally outclassed by *Life Orb* (1.3x boost) or *Choice Specs* (1.5x boost) for most Psychic-type attackers, the Mind-Plate is a **mandatory staple** for running **Arceus-Psychic** in Ubers. It is also used in niche scenarios where a player wants to boost Psychic damage by 20% without the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking of Choice items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is part of the 18-plate cycle required to unlock Arceus's full versatility. It cannot be removed or stolen by moves like *Thief* or *Trick* if held by a Pokémon with Multitype.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered through the **Sinnoh Underground** mining mechanic or found in the **Solaceon Ruins**. In later generations, it is usually found in specialized locations like the Abyssal Ruins or gifted by NPCs associated with myths.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It is primarily obtained via overworld exploration, archaeology-themed mini-games (Underground/Grand Underground), or specific "Item Finder" quests in post-game areas.
