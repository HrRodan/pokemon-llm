## Identity & Utility
**Rage Candy Bar** is a **Specialty Medicine** (categorized under Gameplay/Story items) introduced in Generation II (re-indexed in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A famous confectionery souvenir originating from Mahogany Town in the Johto region. It functions as a consumable healing item that can be used both in and out of battle. While it is marketed as a tourist treat, it possesses medicinal properties similar to a standard Potion.
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores **20 HP** to a single Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** In a competitive environment, 20 HP recovery is statistically insignificant compared to items like Leftovers or Sitrus Berries. Its utility is strictly limited to early-game playthroughs, Nuzlocke resource management, or specific story triggers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Quest Item (Gen IV):** In *HeartGold and SoulSilver*, a Rage Candy Bar can be traded to a NPC in the vertical Underground Path (Kanto) to receive **TM64 (Explosion)**.
    * **Story Trigger (Gen V):** In the Unova region, these items are required to awaken the **Zen Mode Darmanitan** statues found in the Desert Resort.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically sold by a man in Mahogany Town. In various games, it is often found as a rare souvenir in different regions or sold in specialty shops like the Maid in the DPPT Trophy Garden or at the Shopping Mall Nine in Unova.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired via NPC interactions, specific vendors, or as hidden items on the ground.
* **Context:** It belongs to the "Regional Specialty" group of items (alongside the Lava Cookie, Old Gateau, and Casteliacone), which typically provide basic status or HP recovery while serving as world-building elements for their respective home regions.
