## Identity & Utility
**TM53** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** It is a move-teaching device used to grant a compatible Pokémon the move **Energy Ball**. As a member of the "all-machines" category, its primary function is to expand a Pokémon's movepool beyond level-up or breeding constraints. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the price is low, its value is significantly higher due to the high-tier move it provides.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Energy Ball** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile (Energy Ball):** A Special Grass-type attack with a base power of 90 (80 in Gens 4–5) and 100% accuracy. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with the move Fling in a meaningful way).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Energy Ball is the standard high-damage, reliable Grass-type coverage move for Special Attackers. It is preferred over *Solar Beam* (which requires sun) and *Giga Drain* (when raw power is prioritized over healing). It is commonly seen on Grass types like Roserade and Sceptile, as well as coverage for Psychic and Fairy types like Alakazam or Gardevoir.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. In games prior to Generation V and in Generation IX, TMs are generally **consumable** (single-use), whereas from Generations V through VIII, they were **infinite-use**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM53 has been a consistent fixture in the series since its debut, appearing in every major regional Dex from Sinnoh through Paldea. It is typically found in late-game forest areas (like Sinnoh’s Route 226 or Unova’s Victory Road) or purchased from Department Stores and TM Shops. In *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon Materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It must be found as a Poké Ball item on the overworld, received from NPCs, or purchased via specialized shops. Its availability in the "Indigo Disk" suggests continued relevance in high-level endgame content.
