## Identity & Utility
**Mega Anchor** is an **Unused / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (though functionally associated with Generation VI).
* **Description:** A specialized, anchor-shaped accessory that functions as a Key Stone. According to its flavor text, it harnesses a mysterious power that allows a Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution if it is holding its corresponding Mega Stone. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In terms of game logic, it functions as a **Key Stone**. It grants the trainer the ability to trigger Mega Evolution during battle. Specifically, this item is assigned to **Archie**, the leader of Team Aqua, to facilitate the Mega Evolution of his signature Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As an "Unused" item in the player's inventory, it has no impact on competitive play. It exists within the game code primarily for NPC scripting and character flavor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the catalyst for **Mega Evolution**. While it does not "evolve" a Pokémon permanently, it allows for the temporary mid-battle transformation of Pokémon such as **Sharpedo** into **Mega Sharpedo** (Archie's signature Mega).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** While the item exists in the game's internal data, it cannot be acquired by the player through normal gameplay. It is a "dummy" item used to represent Archie’s specific Mega Evolution trigger.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** In *Pokémon Omega Ruby* and *Alpha Sapphire*, Archie wears the Mega Anchor as part of his outfit (typically on his person or as part of his leader gear). It serves as a thematic counterpart to Maxie’s **Mega Glasses**, ensuring both Team Magma and Team Aqua leaders have access to the Mega Evolution mechanic during the Delta Episode and late-game encounters.
