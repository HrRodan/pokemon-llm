## Identity & Utility
**Mystic Ticket** is an **Event Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A specialized travel pass required to board the ferry to the secret location known as **Navel Rock**. It is a unique Key Item that glows with a mysterious, otherworldly light. It cannot be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via special distribution).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held in the player's Key Items pocket, it grants the player passage via the Seagallop Ferries (in *FireRed/LeafGreen*) or the S.S. Tidal (in *Pokémon Emerald*) to reach **Navel Rock**, a remote island location.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This item has no utility in competitive battling; its value lies entirely in enabling the capture of restricted Legendary Pokémon for use in a player's collection or competitive pool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Possession of this item is the only legitimate way in Generation III to encounter the Johto legendary mascots, **Ho-Oh** and **Lugia**, without trading from *Pokémon Colosseum* or *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally distributed as a promotional **Mystery Gift** at real-world Nintendo events (such as the Pokémon Rocks America tour) and via the Nintendo World Store. In-game, once the gift is received at a Poké Mart, the player can travel from Vermilion City (Kanto) or Lilycove City (Hoenn) to the island.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique quest item that cannot be farmed or replicated through the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** Navel Rock is a desolate, towering island. Lugia is found at the very bottom of its deep sea-level chambers, while Ho-Oh is perched at the very peak of the island, mirroring their roles as guardians of the sea and sky respectively.
