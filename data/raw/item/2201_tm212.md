## Identity & Utility
**TM212 (Temper Flare)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** as part of the *Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk* DLC expansion.
* **Description:** A move-teaching tool that imparts the move **Temper Flare** to compatible Pokémon. As a Generation IX TM, it follows the crafting mechanic introduced in Paldea, where TMs are single-use but can be reproduced infinitely once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration in the Terarium or crafted using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Temper Flare**. 
    * **Move Type:** Fire (Physical).
    * **Power:** 75 (Accuracy: 100%).
    * **Secondary Effect:** If the user’s previous move failed (due to an opponent's Protect, a miss, or certain move-blocking abilities), the power of Temper Flare is doubled to **150**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** A tactical niche move for Physical Fire-type attackers. It is particularly effective in VGC (Doubles) as a "Protect punish." If an opponent uses Protect or Wide Guard to nullify the user's previous turn, the user can follow up with a massive 150-power hit. It is often seen on Pokémon like **Entei**, **Arcanine-Hisui**, and **Incineroar**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers and the Blueberry Academy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available within the **Blueberry Academy (Terarium)** during the events of *The Indigo Disk*. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground in the **Savanna Biome** or received as a reward from the BB League trainers.
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once obtained, it can be crafted at a TM Machine using:
    * **10,000 LP**
    * **3x Flareon Fur**
    * **3x Litleo Tuft**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. As a machine, it is strictly an artificial utility item.
