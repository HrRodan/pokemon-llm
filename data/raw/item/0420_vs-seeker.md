## Identity & Utility
**VS Seeker** is a **Gameplay Utility (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (specifically Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen).
* **Description:** A handheld electronic device designed to locate previously defeated Pokémon Trainers who are ready for a rematch. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**, serving as a permanent tool for the player's journey.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated in the overworld, the VS Seeker scans the immediate area for Trainers within the player's line of sight. Trainers interested in a rematch will display a "!!" bubble over their heads and jump in place.
* **Recharge Mechanic:** The device contains a battery that is depleted upon use. It requires the player to take **100 steps** to fully recharge the unit for another scan.
* **Restrictions:** 
    * It cannot be used inside caves, buildings, or gyms.
    * It only functions on Trainers the player has already defeated.
    * It will not work on Elite Four members or Gym Leaders (in its standard iterations).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** While it has no function in a competitive match, it is historically the premier tool for "grinding." It is used to farm experience points and money by repeatedly battling high-payout Trainers (like Gentlemans and Socialites).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon or interact with battle abilities. It is strictly a progression and training tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *FireRed and LeafGreen*, it is obtained from an NPC in the Vermilion City Pokémon Center. In *Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, it is given by Dawn/Lucas on Route 207.
* **World Knowledge:** The VS Seeker is considered one of the most beloved "quality of life" items in the franchise, as it allows for controlled EV (Effort Value) training and financial farming without relying on random encounters or the more chaotic "Match Call" systems of other generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique piece of technology provided to the player by NPCs to aid in their growth as a Trainer.
