## Identity & Utility
**Drowzee Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, it is tailored to the biological makeup of the Drowzee evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought or sold for a nominal fee, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay actions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a compatible Pokémon, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. This bypasses the traditional Effort Value (EV) system in favor of the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the Kanto remakes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** This item is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats. However, within the *Let's Go* competitive meta, Species Candies are essential for "Master Trainers" and maximizing a Pokémon's potential, as they allow a Pokémon to reach its absolute statistical ceiling (up to +200 in every stat via AVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with **Drowzee** and its evolution, **Hypno**. It cannot be used on any other species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the *Let's Go* series by catching wild Drowzee, transferring multiple Drowzee to Professor Oak, or walking with a Drowzee in the Poké Ball Plus accessory. It is also a reward in the GO Park mini-games.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is awarded as a **Capture Reward** for high-quality or consecutive catches (Catch Combos) of Drowzee on routes such as Route 11 in the Kanto region.
