## Identity & Utility
**Croagunk Poison** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological extract dropped by members of the Croagunk evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that serves as a currency/component at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM). It cannot be used directly from the bag in or out of battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars / League Points (**Cheap/Common**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item is used exclusively as an ingredient to craft Technical Machines (TMs). At the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers, players exchange this material along with League Points (LP) to create specific moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression and customization item used in the overworld. It has no tactical utility in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Technical Machine Machine** interface. In the Paldean ecosystem, it represents the biological byproduct of the Poison/Fighting-type Pokémon Croagunk.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop by defeating or catching wild **Croagunk** or **Toxicroak**. It is commonly found in the wetlands and marshes of the Paldea region (such as South Province Area Five or West Province Area Two).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" in the sense of combat equipment, it is a guaranteed drop from the **Croagunk** line. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is part of the generation-specific "Materials" tab in the player's inventory, intended for the streamlined TM crafting system of Scarlet and Violet.
* **Crafting Context:** It is most notably required for crafting moves consistent with Croagunk's kit, such as **TM073 (Drain Punch)**, **TM102 (Gunk Shot)**, or **TM083 (Poison Jab)**.
