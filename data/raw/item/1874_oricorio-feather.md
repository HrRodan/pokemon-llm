## Identity & Utility
**Oricorio Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A feather shed by the Pokémon Oricorio. It is a specialized crafting component categorized as a TM Material. It is a **Consumable/Crafting** item that is primarily obtained through wilderness encounters rather than traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary economic value lies in being exchanged for League Points (LP) or used as a reagent at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at TM Machines located at Pokémon Centers to craft specific Technical Machines. It serves as a fundamental resource for expanding a Pokémon's movepool during the Paldean journey.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Direct).** This item has no utility in a competitive battle setting (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held. However, it is **indirectly vital** for competitive preparation, as it is a required material for crafting high-tier competitive moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting resource. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the **Paldea region**. It is not sold in stores but can be "sold" to the TM Machine to generate League Points. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional held item, it is a **guaranteed drop** upon defeating or catching any form of wild **Oricorio** (Baile, Pom-Pom, Pa'u, or Sensu Styles). In the Paldea region, Oricorio are commonly found in flowery biomes such as South Province (Area One) and the East Province (Area One).
* **Crafting Context:** Based on its biological origin, this material is a key component for crafting powerful Flying-type and support maneuvers, most notably **TM113 (Tailwind)** and **TM160 (Hurricane)**.
