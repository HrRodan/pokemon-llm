## Identity & Utility
**Water Stone** is an **Evolution Item** that has been a staple of the Pokémon series since Generation I (though this specific data entry identifies its classification within the Generation IV framework).
* **Description:** A peculiar, clear-blue stone that radiates aquatic energy. It is a **Consumable** item used directly from the bag on a party Pokémon to trigger instantaneous evolution. While it cannot be used in battle as a held item for stat boosts, it is a critical resource for completing the Pokédex and building competitive teams.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for specialized evolution tools).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag, it triggers the evolution of specific Pokémon species. The current known compatible species include:
    * **Eevee** → Vaporeon
    * **Poliwhirl** → Poliwrath
    * **Shellder** → Cloyster
    * **Staryu** → Starmie
    * **Lombre** → Ludicolo
    * **Panpour** → Simipour
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in the **pre-battle preparation phase**. It is essential for obtaining high-tier competitive threats like **Cloyster** (known for Shell Smash sweeps) and **Ludicolo** (a staple in Rain-based VGC teams).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a single-use item; it is consumed upon a successful evolution. It does not provide any benefit to the Pokémon if held during a match.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally available for purchase at major retail hubs like the **Celadon Dept. Store** or **Lumiose City Stone Shop**. The `underground` attribute indicates it is a common find in the **Sinnoh Underground** or the **Grand Underground** through mining minigames.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon (0% held rate), making it a finite resource in early-game exploration until the player reaches a Department Store or specialized mining area.
* **Lore:** Described as being the blue of a "pool of clear water," it represents the concentrated essence of the ocean, allowing certain species to reach their biological potential through exposure to its radiation.
