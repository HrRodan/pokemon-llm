## Identity & Utility
**Pikanium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A crystallized form of Z-Power specifically tuned to Pikachu. When held by a Pikachu that knows the move **Volt Tackle**, it allows the use of a unique, high-powered Z-Move. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought or sold** (Cost: 0).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item/Special Event acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is a **Pikachu** knowing **Volt Tackle**, it can upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move **Catastropika**. Catastropika is a physical Electric-type attack with a massive **210 Base Power** that does not have the recoil damage associated with the base move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Gimmick. In competitive play (Smogon/VGC during Gen VII), Pikanium Z faces stiff competition from the **Light Ball**, which doubles Pikachu's Attack and Special Attack stats. While Catastropika offers a one-time tactical nuke, the Light Ball provides more consistent damage output across a match. It is primarily used in "Pikachu-themed" teams or for breaking through a specific physical wall.
    * **In-Battle Protection:** As a Z-Crystal, this item **cannot** be removed by *Knock Off*, stolen by *Thief* or *Covet*, or traded via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is species-specific; it does not function if held by **Raichu** or **Alolan Raichu**. It requires the trainer to possess a **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun,* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained as a gift from a Pikachu enthusiast (an NPC with three Pikachu) located in **Konikoni City** after the player has access to the city's outskirts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact of the Alola region's trial system and Z-Move lore.
