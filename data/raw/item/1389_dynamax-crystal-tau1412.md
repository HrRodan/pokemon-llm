## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1412** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event-based item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn, which persists until the end of the day. It functions as a single-use "key" to access rare Gigantamax encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a nominal cost in the data, it is not sold in standard Marts; it is an event-exclusive item typically distributed via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell area) triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. For **Tau1412**, this specifically summons a **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Acquisition Only.** The item itself has no competitive battle utility. Its value lies in providing a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon possessing the Gigantamax Factor, which can then be used in VGC or Smogon formats (where G-Max is permitted).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike standard raid dens that reset or rotate based on game time and Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific species encounter regardless of the current den pool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is an **Event-Exclusive** item. In the real world, it was distributed via serial codes through various retail partnerships (such as CoroCoro in Japan or specific Western retailers) to promote the Gigantamax mechanic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to be claimed via the Mystery Gift feature. 
* **Lore Context:** The "Tau" naming convention is part of a series of alphanumeric codes (like *And*, *Lon*, *Sek*) used by the game's internal data to categorize different promotional raid encounters. These crystals allow trainers to bypass the RNG of the Wild Area to secure high-tier raid rewards.
