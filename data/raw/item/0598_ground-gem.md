## Identity & Utility
**Ground Gem** is a **Jewel** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A single-use, "essence of land" gemstone that provides a massive, one-time power boost to Ground-type attacks. It is a **Consumable Competitive Held Item** that is technically priced at a low cost but is rarely available in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though its value in competitive play far exceeds its nominal shop price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Ground-type move, the move's power is increased by **1.5×** (in Gen V) or **1.3×** (in Gen VI+). The item is consumed immediately upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have no base power if attempted).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **high-tier competitive staple** in Generation V, particularly in VGC and Smogon formats. It allows physical attackers like **Landorus-Therian** or **Excadrill** to reach specific "one-hit knockout" (OHKO) thresholds with *Earthquake* that would otherwise be impossible. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Unburden:** Frequently paired with the **Unburden** ability (e.g., on Hawlucha or Hitmonlee); once the Ground Gem is consumed by an attack, the Pokémon's Speed is doubled.
    * **Acrobatics:** Consuming the gem counts as the Pokémon no longer holding an item, doubling the power of the move *Acrobatics* if used subsequently.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Dust Clouds** in caves across the Unova region (Twist Mountain, Victory Road, etc.). In subsequent generations, the Ground Gem became significantly harder to obtain, often being restricted to special events or specific battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In its debut generation, it was exclusively gathered via **Cave Phenomena** (Dust Clouds), making it a farmable resource for dedicated trainers but one that requires environmental exploration rather than traditional shopping.
