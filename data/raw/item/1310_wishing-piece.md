## Identity & Utility
**Wishing-piece** is a Collectible item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, glowing fragment that resonates with the Power Spots of the Galar region. It is a **Consumable Interaction Item** used exclusively to trigger Max Raid Battles by being thrown into empty Pokémon Dens. While it can technically be sold, its primary utility is as a resource for spawning encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal sell value**). Note: Its primary "cost" in-game is 3,000 Watts when purchased from Watt Traders, making it a mid-tier resource for active players.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in front of an inactive Pokémon Den (one without a natural light pillar), it forces a Dynamax Pokémon to appear, initiating a **Max Raid Battle**. This creates a red beam of light; occasionally, it may trigger a rare purple "strong" beam, which yields Pokémon with better IVs, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax potential.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Infrastructure Utility.** While not held in battle, it is the primary engine for "Raid Farming." It is essential for competitive players to acquire Pokémon with 5-6 perfect IVs, specific Tera Types (in later transfers), or rare Hidden Abilities not found in the wild.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the **Dynamax/Gigantamax** mechanic. It is the only way to manually refresh Den encounters without waiting for a natural daily reset or clearing all active dens.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Watt Traders** located throughout the Wild Area, Isle of Armor, and Crown Tundra for 3,000 Watts. It can also be obtained as a rare sparkle pickup on the ground or produced via the **Cram-o-matic** (Experimental recipe: 4x Stardust or other valuable minerals).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In Galar lore, these pieces are thought to be fragments of the energy associated with Eternatus, scattered across the region's Power Spots.
