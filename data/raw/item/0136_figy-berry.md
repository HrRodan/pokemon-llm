## Identity & Utility
**Figy Berry** is a **Picky-healing Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal berry that provides "pinch" healing when the holder's health drops. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be bought or farmed. While it is categorized as a healing item, its "picky" nature refers to a taste-based drawback: it induces confusion if the consumer dislikes **Spicy** flavors.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder’s HP falls to **50% (1/2)** or less, the Figy Berry is consumed to restore **1/8 (12.5%)** of the holder's maximum HP. 
    * *Flavor Constraint:* If the consumer has a nature that dislikes **Spicy** flavors (specifically natures that decrease the **Attack** stat: **Bold, Modest, Calm, and Timid**), it becomes **Confused** after consumption.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the Berry's healing effect and potential confusion on the target).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it acts as a **Fire-type** attack with 80 Base Power (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically, this is a **Niche Competitive Item**. In later generations (Gen VII), its healing was buffed to 50% before being nerfed to 33% in Gen VIII; however, based on the current data (1/8 recovery), it is largely outclassed by the **Sitrus Berry** (which restores 1/4 HP) unless paired with the ability **Gluttony** (which allows consumption at 50% HP) or used to intentionally trigger confusion for specific strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Interacts with the **Gluttony** ability, causing the Pokémon to eat the berry at 50% HP instead of the standard "pinch" threshold.
    * Interacts with **Ripen**, doubling the HP restored.
    * Can be recycled via the move **Recycle** or the ability **Harvest**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly obtained through Berry Trees (Hoenn/Sinnoh/Kalos) or Berry Piles (Alola). It can be purchased for a low cost in regions where Berry Marts or specialized shops exist.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not listed as a standard held item for wild encounters in this dataset; it is primarily acquired through **cultivation and harvesting** in Berry patches.
* **Lore context:** The Figy Berry is known for its distinct spicy flavor. It is part of a cycle of five berries (Figy, Wiki, Mago, Aguav, Iapapa) that each correspond to a specific flavor and nature-based confusion trigger.
