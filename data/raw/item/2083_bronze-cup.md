## Identity & Utility
**Bronze Cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
*   **Description:** A decorative accessory used to customize the player's picnic set. It serves as a cosmetic replacement for the standard cups used during picnic sessions. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Cosmetic** item that **can** be bought.
*   **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for customization items).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When a picnic is set up in the Paldea region, the player can swap their default picnic gear for the Bronze Cup. This changes the visual appearance of the picnic table setup during sandwich-making and Pokémon interaction.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling utility).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely aesthetic item used for the overworld Picnic mechanic and has no impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon).
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is part of the "Picnic Knacks" collection used to personalize the player's camp.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Primarily purchased at **Picnic Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities (such as Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia). 
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced consumer good within the Paldea region's economy, intended for trainers who enjoy outdoor bonding with their team.
