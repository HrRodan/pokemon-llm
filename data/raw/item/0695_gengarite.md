## Identity & Utility
**Gengarite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized stone designed for a specific Pokémon species. When held by a Gengar, it acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Key Stone. It is a permanent **Held Item** that is not consumed upon use but cannot be bought through traditional currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). As a Mega Stone, it is never sold in standard Poké Marts and must be obtained through exploration, gifts, or post-game BP (Battle Points) exchanges.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Gengar, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** at the start of its turn. This transforms Gengar into **Mega Gengar**, significantly increasing its Special Attack, Speed, and Special Defense, while replacing its ability with **Shadow Tag**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage, but generally discouraged as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the match).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier/Uber Staple.** Mega Gengar is one of the most powerful entities in competitive history due to the **Shadow Tag** ability, which prevents opponents from switching out. It was famously banned from standard Smogon play (OU) to the Ubers tier and is a dominant force in any VGC format where Mega Evolution is permitted.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution. It only facilitates a temporary, mid-battle transformation. It cannot be removed via *Knock Off* or stolen via *Thief* once Mega Evolution has occurred.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specialized locations or gifted by NPCs. 
    * In *Pokémon X/Y*, it is found in Laverre City. 
    * In *Pokémon Sun/Moon*, it is purchased at the Battle Tree for 64 BP. 
    * In *Pokémon Let's Go*, it is gifted by Blue at the Pallet Town Lab after defeating the Cinnabar Gym.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item (unless obtained via BP) and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
