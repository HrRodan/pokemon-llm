## Identity & Utility
**Salt** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A basic seasoning used during the Picnic sandwich-making minigame. It is a **Consumable** item used to modify the "Meal Powers" of a sandwich. While it has no utility in direct combat, it is a foundational resource for the Paldean picnic mechanic.
* **Cost:** 90 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a seasoning to create sandwiches that grant **Meal Powers**. In the sandwich mechanic, Salt primarily contributes to **Exp. Point Power** and **Encounter Power**. It is often used to balance out Bitter or Sour ingredients to reach specific power thresholds.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard ingredients cannot be held by Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld sandwich-making mechanic. It provides no statistical or tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Salt does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a crafting component for the Picnic system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Salt is a common commodity found in specialized grocery stores across the Paldea region. It is sold at **Sure Cans**, **Deli Cioso**, and **Every Wich Way** locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or natural stones, this is a processed culinary item that must be purchased from vendors rather than farmed from the environment or obtained via the **Pickup** ability.
