## Identity & Utility
**TM151 (Phantom Force)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea region (Generation IX), TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at any Pokémon Center's TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or by crafting using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Phantom Force** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Details:** Phantom Force is a Ghost-type Physical move with a Base Power of 90.
    * **Turn 1:** The user "vanishes" instantly, becoming semi-invulnerable (avoiding most attacks).
    * **Turn 2:** The user attacks. 
    * **Special Property:** This move **bypasses and breaks protection** moves such as *Protect*, *Detect*, *Spiky Shield*, *Baneful Bunker*, and *King's Shield*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with the move Fling in modern generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **niche/tactical** option. While two-turn moves are often avoided in high-level singles due to being predictable, Phantom Force is highly valued for its ability to punish "Protect-spam" in VGC (Doubles) and provide Ghost-type physical attackers (like Dragapult) a high-power STAB move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use.
