## Identity & Utility
**Fire Gem** is a **Jewel** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A gem containing a concentrated essence of flame. It is a **Consumable Competitive Held Item** that provides a one-time power boost to a Fire-type attack. Once the move is executed, the item is destroyed.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though its availability is often restricted to special vendors or hidden grottos rather than standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging Fire-type move, the move's power is increased by **1.5×** (in Generation V) or **1.3×** (in Generation VI and later), and the gem is consumed. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item is typically consumed by the user's own Fire-type move before Fling can be utilized, and it lacks a specific Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **high-impact offensive tool**, particularly in Generation V. It is used to reach specific damage "benchmarks" to secure One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) that would otherwise be impossible. It is frequently paired with the ability **Unburden**, as consuming the gem immediately triggers the speed double.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Synergizes with the move **Acrobatics** (by becoming itemless after use) and the ability **Recycle**, which can potentially restore the gem for another use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered in **Dust Clouds** within caves across the Unova region. In subsequent generations, Type-Gems became significantly rarer, often restricted to special distributions or high-tier battle facility rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not currently found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through environmental exploration or as a reward for prowess in battle facilities like the Battle Subway or Pokémon World Tournament.
