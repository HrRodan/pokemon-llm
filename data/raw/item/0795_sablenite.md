## Identity & Utility
**Sablenite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in Generation VI (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*).
* **Description:** A mysterious, specialized evolutionary stone. When held by a Sableye, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically acquired through exploration or special BP vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the transformation of **Sableye** into **Mega Sableye** in battle. This transformation significantly boosts Sableye's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense while lowering its Speed. Most notably, it replaces Sableye's ability with **Magic Bounce**, which reflects non-damaging moves (hazards, status, etc.) back at the attacker.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Though technically assigned a value, Mega Stones cannot be removed via Knock Off, stolen via Thief, or used with Fling if the holder is the intended Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Defensive Staple.** Mega Sableye is a cornerstone of "Stall" archetypes in competitive formats like Smogon’s OU or National Dex. Its access to Magic Bounce makes it one of the best hazard deterrents in the game, and its increased bulk allows it to function as a formidable wall and status spreader (Will-O-Wisp).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with **Sableye**. It does not trigger a permanent evolution but a temporary, mid-battle form change. It is unaffected by the ability *Klutz* (in terms of Mega Evolution) and cannot be removed by an opponent's moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire**, it is found in Sootopolis City.
    * In **Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon**, it is obtained at the Battle Tree for 64 BP.
    * In **Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee**, it is purchased from the Stone Salesman at the Pokémon League.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind treasure usually granted to the player during the post-game or through high-level battle challenges.
