## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Cup** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A cosmetic customization item used during the picnic mechanic. It is a **consumable-style aesthetic upgrade** that, once purchased, allows the player to change the visual appearance of their picnic set. It cannot be used in battle and does not provide mechanical buffs to sandwich making.
* **Cost:** 1500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player initiates a picnic, they can customize their table's appearance. The Yellow Cup replaces the default cup model with a yellow-themed variant.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld "Picnic" sub-game and has no impact on EVs, IVs, or combat stats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities. It is categorized under the "Picnic" system, which is used for friendship building, Egg discovery, and meal power buffs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Picnic Knacks** specialty stores located in major Paldean hubs such as **Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a retail-exclusive item designed for trainer personalization.
* **World Context:** In the Paldea region, picnicking is a central cultural activity for trainers. Customizing picnic gear like cups, cloths, and bottles serves as a gold sink for players and a way to express personal style within the "Treasure Hunt" journey.
