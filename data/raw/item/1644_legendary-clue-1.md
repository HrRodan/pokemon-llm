## Identity & Utility
**Legendary Clue 1** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** A handwritten note authored by the NPC Peony, featuring an old, weathered photograph. It contains cryptic information regarding the "King of Bountiful Harvests." As a Key Item, it is indispensable for story progression and resides in a dedicated pocket of the Bag.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Key Item; Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a quest-triggering device. Possessing this item allows the player to initiate and track the "King of Bountiful Harvests" expedition in the Crown Tundra. It specifically guides the player toward investigating the wooden statue in Freezington, which eventually leads to the encounter with the Legendary Pokémon **Calyrex**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item is strictly used for narrative progression and exploration within the Crown Tundra DLC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. However, it is the mechanical "anchor" for the Calyrex questline, which eventually allows the player to obtain the Reins of Unity to fuse Calyrex with its steeds (Glastrier or Spectrier).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the main story of the Crown Tundra expansion. It is given to the player by **Peony** at his "Base Camp" in Freezington after the player successfully completes their first Dynamax Adventure and joins his exploration team.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind quest item.
* **Context:** The item represents Peony's over-enthusiastic (and often slightly inaccurate) research into the local legends of the Galar region. While Peony views these clues as part of his "Adaventure Tours," they are grounded in the genuine history of the Crown Tundra's former protector.
