## Identity & Utility
**TM38 (Fire Blast)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation I** (though metadata identifies its specific ID entry within the Generation III index). 
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding machine used to teach a Pokémon the move **Fire Blast**, a high-intensity Fire-type special attack. As a Machine category item, it is a staple of team building, allowing Pokémon to learn powerful coverage or STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves they would not otherwise learn through leveling up.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Note: While the base data lists 1,000, in many regional Department Stores, this TM is traditionally priced as a premium item (often 5,500 or 30,000 Pokedollars) or earned through Gym Leader victories.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Fire Blast** to a compatible Pokémon. Fire Blast is an iconic, high-power Special Fire move (110-120 Base Power depending on the Generation) with an 85% accuracy rate and a 10% chance to leave the target with a **Burn**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines generally cannot be effectively used with Fling; `sling_power` is null).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Fire Blast is the gold standard for Special Attackers requiring maximum damage output. It is frequently preferred over Flamethrower in Smogon and VGC formats for its ability to secure specific One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) against bulky Steel, Grass, and Bug types, despite the risk of missing. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Usage mechanics vary by generation: it was single-use in Gens 1-4, infinite-use in Gens 5-8, and returned to a craftable/single-use format in Gen 9 (Scarlet/Violet).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available for purchase at major **Department Stores** (such as Celadon, Lilycove, or Veilstone). In the Kanto region, it is traditionally gifted to the player by **Gym Leader Blaine** after his defeat at the Cinnabar Island Gym.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial item manufactured for trainers, often distributed by Gym Leaders to signify a trainer's mastery over fire-type tactics.
* **Visual Lore:** The move it teaches is famous for its Japanese "大" (dai) shape, representing a bonfire or "great" flame, which is reflected in the flavor text describing it as an "all-consuming fire."
