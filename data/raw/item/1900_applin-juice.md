## Identity & Utility
**Applin Juice** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological byproduct/material shed by the Applin evolutionary line. It functions as a specialized crafting resource rather than a consumable medicine or a battle-ready held item. It cannot be used directly from the bag to affect a Pokémon's stats or health.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily valued for its exchange rate in League Points (LP) or as a crafting component).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. It serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) that match the elemental themes of the Applin line (typically Dragon, Grass, or specialized physical attacks).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held or used in battle. Its value is purely foundational for building a competitive team's movepools during the preparation phase.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the Applin line requires specific Apples (Tart, Sweet, or Syrupy) to evolve, **Applin Juice** is not an evolution trigger. It is strictly a currency/material for move acquisition.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available for purchase at standard Poké Marts or Delibird Presents. It must be farmed through wild encounters.
* **Wild Drops:** Automatically dropped after defeating or catching wild members of the Applin family, including **Applin**, **Flapple**, **Appletun**, and **Dipplin**. It is most efficiently gathered in areas like the Tagtree Thicket (Paldea) or the Apple Hills (Kitakami).
* **Resource Management:** In the Sinnoh/Paldea economy, players often hoard this material to craft high-value TMs or sell it for League Points (LP) when in need of currency.
