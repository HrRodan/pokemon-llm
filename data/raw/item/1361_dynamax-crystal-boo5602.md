## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (boo5602)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-based consumable used exclusively in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use mission-trigger item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap; however, this is a placeholder value as the item is typically acquired via serial codes rather than standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair forces a Max Raid Battle to spawn. These crystals were primarily distributed as pre-order bonuses or promotional tie-ins (such as those from retail partners like Best Buy or specialized magazines). They allow players to encounter specific Pokémon—often those that are version-exclusive or possess the Gigantamax factor—regardless of standard den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item used to facilitate a raid encounter. The resulting Pokémon caught from the raid may have competitive value (e.g., Hidden Abilities or high IVs), but the crystal itself has no battle application.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal gameplay. It is a **Promotional Distribution** item acquired via serial codes. The "boo5602" designation identifies a specific encounter profile within the game's internal data (similar to codes used for the Larvitar or Jangmo-o pre-order bonuses).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" that resides in the Other Items pocket of the Bag.
* **World Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles, allowing a trainer to summon a specific powerful Dynamax or Gigantamax entity to a localized den at will, bypassing the natural "Wishing Piece" RNG.
