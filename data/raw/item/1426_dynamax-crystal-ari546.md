## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Ari546** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specific, consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (traditionally Larvitar in promotional distributions) to appear as a raid boss. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a nominal value, it is not found in Marts; the cost exists primarily as a placeholder for internal game logic or accidental resale.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Stony Wilderness of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to initiate a Max Raid Battle. The encounter persists until the end of the calendar day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld encounter mechanic. However, it is competitively relevant for "farming," as it allows players to encounter Pokémon with guaranteed high IVs and the potential for Hidden Abilities, which are essential for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (Ari546) was historically used to grant players access to the **Larvitar** evolutionary line in a Max Raid setting, which is otherwise a version-exclusive or rare spawn.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **Event-Exclusive**. It was originally distributed via serial codes, often as a pre-order bonus for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* or through retail partnerships (such as Target or GameStop). It cannot be obtained through standard exploration or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated clusters of Galar Particles. The "Ari546" designation serves as a specific frequency or coordinate that resonates with the Watchtower Lair to summon a specific species of Pokémon that wouldn't normally inhabit that specific den.
