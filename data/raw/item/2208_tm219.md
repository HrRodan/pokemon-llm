## Identity & Utility
**TM219 (Skitter Smack)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Skitter Smack**. As a modern Technical Machine, it is a single-use consumable that can be reproduced via the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafting rather than direct purchase from a Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Skitter Smack** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Details:** Skitter Smack is a Physical Bug-type move with a Base Power of 70 and 90% Accuracy.
    * **Secondary Effect:** It has a guaranteed (100%) chance to lower the target's **Special Attack** stat by one stage upon a successful hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be held or used with Fling in Generation IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche Utility** item. While Bug-type moves have limited offensive coverage, the guaranteed Special Attack drop makes it a valuable tool for physical attackers to neuter opposing Special Sweepers or supportive "bulky" special attackers. It is often seen in VGC (doubles) on Pokémon looking to provide disruption while dealing chip damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. The move itself is particularly thematic for various Bug-type and agile physical attackers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically added in **The Indigo Disk** DLC. It can be found as a collectible item on the ground within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy or unlocked for crafting at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM, a trainer typically requires:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Spidops Silk**
    * **3x Tarountula Thread**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found in the overworld or manufactured using materials gathered from the **Tarountula** evolutionary line.
