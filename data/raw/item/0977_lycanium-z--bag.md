## Identity & Utility
**Lycanium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** (specifically a species-specific Z-Crystal) introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crystal that converts Z-Power to allow Lycanroc to access its unique Z-Move. In the inventory, it acts as a permanent **Key Item** that can be used to provide an unlimited supply of Lycanium Z held items for a trainer's Pokémon. It is a **Non-consumable** item that **Cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique story item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by any form of **Lycanroc** (Midday, Midnight, or Dusk) that knows the move **Stone Edge**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Splintered Stormshards**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Z-Move Details:** **Splintered Stormshards** is a physical Rock-type move with a massive **190 Base Power**. 
    * **Secondary Effect:** Upon use, it successfully **eliminates all Terrains** from the battlefield (Electric, Grassy, Misty, or Psychic Terrain).
    * **Fling Power:** 0 (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-impact **Competitive Staple** in Generation VII formats. It served as a primary counter to the "Tapu" meta by forcibly removing terrains while dealing massive damage. Its utility in clearing Psychic Terrain or Electric Terrain made Lycanroc a dangerous niche threat in VGC and Smogon tiers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically tied to the Lycanroc line. It does not trigger evolution but requires the Pokémon to be in its fully evolved state to function. It is unaffected by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* while held in battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is exclusive to *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. It is obtained as part of the main story progression, gifted to the player by **Hau** after the player defeats him at Malie City on Ula'ula Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a Z-Crystal, it is a unique artifact associated with the Alolan Island Challenge and cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
