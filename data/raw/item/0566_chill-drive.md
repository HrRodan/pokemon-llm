## Identity & Utility
**Chill Drive** is a species-specific Held Item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized high-tech cassette designed specifically for the Mythical Pokémon **Genesect**. When equipped, it modifies the elemental output of the Pokémon's weapon systems. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold in standard markets.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition/Unique Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by **Genesect**, the move **Techno Blast** changes its type from Normal to **Ice-type**. Additionally, it alters Genesect's physical model, turning the drive inserted into its cannon **white**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Standard physical damage upon being thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Tactical.** The Chill Drive allows Genesect to utilize a 120-base power (Gen VI+) Ice-type attack without the charge-up time of Blizzard or the lower power of Ice Beam. This is specifically used to hard-counter 4x Ice-weak threats like Rayquaza, Landorus-T, and Gliscor. However, it is often secondary to Choice Scarf or Life Orb sets, as it occupies the item slot solely to change one move's type.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item functions as a form-change mechanic for **Genesect**. It does not trigger evolution. It is immune to being removed by the move *Thief* or *Covet* if held by the correct species in certain generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via a specific NPC associated with fossil research or Team Plasma. In its debut (Black/White), it was obtained in the **P2 Laboratory** after defeating Scientist Dudley. In later generations, it is typically handed out by NPCs in labs (like the Fossil Lab in Gen VI or the Stow-on-Side bargain shop in Gen VIII).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. As a piece of specialized technology created by Team Plasma, it is restricted to unique story encounters or distributions.
