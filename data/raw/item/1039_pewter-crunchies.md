## Identity & Utility
**Pewter Crunchies** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** Known as Pewter City’s famous local snack, these treats function as a medicinal consumable that can be used both in and out of battle. It is a consumable item that can be bought at specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 250 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Heals a single Pokémon of all non-volatile status conditions, including Sleep, Poison, Burn, Paralysis, and Freeze. It acts as a regional equivalent to the **Full Heal**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage only; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is used exclusively for **playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**. In standard competitive formats (VGC or Smogon), manual status cures are non-viable; players instead opt for the **Lum Berry**, which provides the same effect automatically as a held item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** As a "Regional Specialty" item, it belongs to the same class as the Lava Cookie, Old Gateau, and Casteliacone. It does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available at the **Pewter City Poké Mart** and from a dedicated souvenir vendor in Pewter City. Because it costs significantly less than a standard Full Heal (which typically costs 400–600 Poké Dollars), it is a highly cost-effective alternative for inventory management during Kanto-based adventures.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally acquired via NPC interaction or direct purchase rather than through the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
