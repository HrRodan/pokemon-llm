## Identity & Utility
**TM00 (Mega Punch)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This item is a data disc used to teach the move **Mega Punch** to compatible Pokémon. In Generation VIII, TMs are infinite-use items, allowing a trainer to teach the move to their entire roster if desired. It is categorized as a high-power physical Normal-type move.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While accessible, it represents a significant early-to-mid-game investment for trainers.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on a compatible Pokémon, it teaches the move **Mega Punch**. 
    * **Move Specs:** Mega Punch is a Physical Normal-type move with **80 Base Power** and **85% Accuracy**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Low Tier.** Mega Punch is rarely seen in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon. Its 85% accuracy makes it unreliable compared to moves like *Body Slam* (which has a 30% paralysis chance) or *Double-Edge* (which has higher power). It serves primarily as a mid-game power boost for physical attackers during a standard playthrough or Nuzlocke.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of "punching" Pokémon and bipedal physical attackers (e.g., Hitmonchan, Snorlax, Mew).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TM00 is specifically available for purchase at the **Pokémon Center in North Motostoke** for 10,000 Poké Dollars. Unlike TRs (Technical Records), this TM does not break after one use.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is a manufactured human technology designed for Pokémon training. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it must be purchased or found in specific overworld locations.
