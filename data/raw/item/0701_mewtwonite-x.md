## Identity & Utility
**Mewtwonite X** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, rare stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by Mewtwo, it allows the Pokémon to undergo a transformation into Mega Mewtwo X during battle, provided the Trainer has a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold in standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Its value is priceless, as it is a unique key-item-adjacent tool specifically for legendary empowerment.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Mewtwo in battle, the player can trigger a Mega Evolution. This transformation changes Mewtwo’s form into **Mega Mewtwo X**, altering its type from pure Psychic to **Psychic/Fighting**. The transformation also grants a massive increase to its base stats, particularly its Attack and Special Attack.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. While it can be used with the move Fling, doing so is highly discouraged as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the battle and provides no secondary status effect.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Uber Tier Powerhouse.** In competitive formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (like Smogon Ubers or specific VGC seasons), Mewtwonite X is used to pivot Mewtwo from a traditional Special Attacker into a terrifying **Physical or Mixed Sweeper**. It grants the ability *Steadfast*, which increases Speed when flinched.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to Mewtwo. It is one of two possible Mega Stones for Mewtwo, the other being Mewtwonite Y. Unlike standard evolution items, the Mega Stone is not consumed upon use and can be used infinitely, though only one Pokémon per team may Mega Evolve per battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired in the **post-game**. In its debut (Pokémon X), it is obtained after catching Mewtwo in the Unknown Dungeon. In subsequent titles like Sun/Moon or Let's Go, it is typically gifted by elite NPCs (like Red or Green) or purchased via special BP (Battle Points) vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon**. It is a unique artifact that must be found in specific overworld locations or through scripted events. It cannot be generated by the **Pickup** ability.
