## Identity & Utility
**Everstone** is a **Training Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone that, when held by a Pokémon, prevents it from undergoing the evolution process. It is a **Held Item** that can be purchased in various regions or discovered through mining and exploration. Unlike evolution stones that trigger change, the Everstone acts as a biological inhibitor.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; accessible mid-game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon is prevented from evolving naturally through leveling up. This allows trainers to keep a Pokémon in its current form to learn moves earlier or to maintain a specific aesthetic. Note: Evolution via evolutionary stones (manual intervention) can still be initiated by the trainer.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally **Niche/Non-Combat**. In a competitive battle context, the Everstone offers no stat boosts, making it vastly inferior to the **Eviolite** for Not-Fully-Evolved (NFE) Pokémon. Its primary "competitive" value lies in **Breeding**.
* **Breeding & Interaction (World Knowledge):**
    * **Nature Inheritance:** Since Gen IV, if a parent holds an Everstone while in the Day Care or Nursery, there is a 100% chance (since Gen VI) the offspring will inherit that parent's **Nature**.
    * **Regional Form Preservation:** Essential for breeding non-native regional forms (e.g., breeding a Kantonian Meowth in Alola requires the parent to hold an Everstone to prevent the offspring from becoming Alolan Meowth).
    * **Interaction:** It is often found via the **Underground** mechanic in Sinnoh.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City) or found in caves. It is a frequent reward from the **Underground** and the **Cram-o-matic**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently carried by rock-based Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Geodude, Graveler, Golem, Roggenrola, Boldore,** and **Gigalith** (usually a 5% encounter rate). Using a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability increases the chance of finding it, while the move **Thief** or the **Pickup** ability can be used to harvest them efficiently.
