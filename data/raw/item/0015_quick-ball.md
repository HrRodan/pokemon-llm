## Identity & Utility
**Quick Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball designed for high-efficiency capturing. It features a unique blue and yellow aesthetic with a prominent "X" or "V" motif. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used from the bag during wild encounters. It is **usable only in battle** and is consumed regardless of whether the capture is successful.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Specialty price**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Quick Ball provides a significant multiplier to the catch rate if used on the **very first turn** of a wild encounter.
    * **Generation IV:** Provides a **4× catch rate multiplier** on Turn 1.
    * **Generation V onwards:** Provides a **5× catch rate multiplier** on Turn 1.
    * **Turn 2+:** The catch rate multiplier drops to **1×** (equivalent to a standard Poké Ball) for the remainder of the battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls typically cannot be used with the move Fling to deal damage, though they are technically "holdable").
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** It has no impact on competitive PvP (VGC/Smogon) as catching is restricted to wild encounters. However, it is considered a "top-tier" utility item for **Shiny Hunting**, **Nuzlocke encounters**, and completing the Pokédex rapidly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of the most effective tools for capturing "Roaming Legendaries" (like Mesprit or Cresselia) before they can flee on the first turn.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In most regions, Quick Balls are sold at specialized Poké Marts (e.g., Canalave City, Snowpoint City) or in the later stages of the game at standard Marts once the player has earned enough Gym Badges. They are also frequently available at the Pokémon League or through "Bargain" shops/Watta Traders in newer generations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike the standard Poké Ball or Great Ball, the Quick Ball is rarely found via the **Pickup** ability, usually requiring direct purchase or finding it as a "hidden item" in the overworld.
