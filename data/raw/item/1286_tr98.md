## Identity & Utility
**TR98** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that imparts the move **Liquidation** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, mirroring the mechanics of classic TMs from earlier generations. It represents a high-tier Physical Water-type attack.
* **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary valuation, it is primarily exchanged for **Watts** via Watt Traders in the Galar Wild Area.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Liquidation**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Physical Water-type attack with **85 Base Power** and 100% Accuracy. It carries a **20% chance to lower the target's Defense** stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 85 (High damage; mirrors the move's base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** Liquidation is the preferred Physical Water STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for many offensive threats. It is significantly more powerful and reliable than Waterfall for Pokémon like **Urshifu-Rapid-Strike, Barraskewda, Araquanid,** and **Dracovish**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time consumable; once the move is taught, the item is removed from the inventory.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by defeating Water-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** within the Galar region. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** at varying locations in the Wild Area for a price of Watts (typically 3,000–5,000 W depending on the rotation).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Its availability is tied strictly to raid rewards and specialized currency vendors, making it a resource that players must "farm" through cooperative play or exploration.
