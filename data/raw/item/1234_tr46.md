## Identity & Utility
**TR46 (Iron Defense)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Iron Defense**. According to its design, the user hardens its body's surface like iron to sharply raise its Defense stat. As a Technical Record (TR), it is consumed upon use, distinguishing it from the infinite-use Technical Machines (TMs) found in the same generation.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** at Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Iron Defense** to a compatible Pokémon. Iron Defense is a Steel-type status move that increases the user's **Defense stat by two stages (+2)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). This item has no secondary effect when used with the move Fling and provides minimal damage.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** Iron Defense is a cornerstone of "Setup Sweeper" and "Wall" archetypes. It is most notably paired with the move **Body Press** (introduced in the same generation), which calculates damage using the user's Defense stat rather than Attack, allowing defensive Pokémon like Corviknight, Ferrothorn, and Zamazenta to become offensive threats while remaining nearly unbreakable by physical attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Steel, Rock, and bulky Water-type Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR46 is primarily obtained as a reward for defeating Steel-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (usually around 2,000–5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike held items, TRs are treated as data storage units and are typically farmed via Raid dens or the Cram-o-matic (in the Isle of Armor DLC).
