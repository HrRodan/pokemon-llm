## Identity & Utility
**Grass-Gem** is a **Jewel** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized gemstone containing the essence of nature. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that triggers automatically in battle. While its listed cost is low, its availability is often restricted to environmental RNG or specialized post-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though rarely sold in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging **Grass-type move**, the power of that move is increased by **1.5×** (in Gen V) or **1.3×** (in Gen VI+). The item is **consumed** immediately upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Gems generally have low Fling power and no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **High-Tier Niche/Historical Staple**. In Generation V, Gems were dominant for securing specific One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) without the locking penalty of Choice items. It is particularly potent on Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (like Sceptile), as consuming the Gem instantly triggers the massive speed boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It synergizes exceptionally well with the move **Acrobatics** (doubling in power once the Gem is consumed) and the ability **Harvest** (which can potentially restore the consumed Gem).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally found primarily in the Unova region within **Dust Clouds** inside caves. In subsequent generations, elemental gems (excluding the Normal Gem) became significantly rarer, often restricted to special events, Poké Mile shops, or specific battle facility rewards.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via environmental exploration or the **Pickup** ability in specific game versions.
