## Identity & Utility
**Shellder Pearl** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Shellder evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** used primarily at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. While it has a listed value, it is primarily used as a currency-equivalent for crafting rather than a direct-use item.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars / League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component in the crafting of Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is required to create moves associated with the Shellder line’s themes, such as **TM110 (Liquidation)** and **TM142 (Hydro Pump)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the out-of-battle crafting economy and provides no tactical advantage in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **TM Machine** mechanic introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching a wild **Shellder** or **Cloyster**. It can also be found as a sparkling pickup in environments where these Pokémon spawn (typically coastal or ocean biomes).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense of older generations (like the valuable Big Pearl), it is a dedicated drop from:
    * **Shellder**
    * **Cloyster**
* **Lore Context:** In the Paldea region, materials like these are gathered by trainers to utilize "Technical Machine Machine" technology, which synthesizes powerful move-teaching discs from Pokémon-derived components and League Points (LP).
