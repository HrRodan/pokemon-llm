## Identity & Utility
**Blue Card** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically within the *HeartGold and SoulSilver* versions).
* **Description:** A specialized punch-card or digital tracker used specifically for the "Buena’s Password" radio show broadcast from the Goldenrod Radio Tower. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest item provided to the player to facilitate a recurring daily mini-game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Blue Card allows the trainer to participate in the daily "Buena’s Password" radio program. Upon hearing the password on the Pokégear’s Radio channel, the player visits Buena in Goldenrod City to provide the answer. The card records one point per correct daily answer.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for out-of-battle progression and resource gathering.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the card itself does not evolve Pokémon, the points accumulated on it can be traded with Buena’s assistant for high-value items, including **Rare Candies**, **Protein**, **Iron**, **Calcium**, **HP Up**, and the **Up-Grade** (used for evolving Porygon).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively at the **Goldenrod Radio Tower** in the Johto region. It is given freely by Buena the first time the player speaks to her.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is unique to the player's inventory and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** The Blue Card represents the fan-engagement side of Johto's media culture. Buena is a famous radio personality, and the Blue Card acts as a loyalty program for her listeners, rewarding consistent tuning-in with rare combat and growth supplements.
