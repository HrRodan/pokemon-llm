## Identity & Utility
**Illumise Fluid** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material representing secretions or biological essence from the Pokémon Illumise. It is a **Consumable Resource** that cannot be used directly in battle but is spent at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine).
* **Cost:** 10 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal value; primarily used for its League Point value in crafting rather than direct sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea or Kitakami regions. When combined with League Points (LP) and other materials, it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be effectively used in battle via the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats as a held item. Its value lies entirely in the "out-of-battle" preparation phase to grant Pokémon new moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource-tier item within the Generation IX crafting ecosystem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop by **defeating or catching** wild Illumise. Since Illumise was added to the Generation IX Pokédex via the **Teal Mask DLC (Kitakami region)**, this item is primarily found in those areas.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop added to the player's inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter with an **Illumise**. It is often farmed by players looking to craft Bug-type or support-oriented TMs, such as **TM131 (Pollen Puff)**.
