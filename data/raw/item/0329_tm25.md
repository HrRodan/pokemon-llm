## Identity & Utility
**TM25** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation I** (though this specific data entry references its metadata from Generation III onwards).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In most iterations of the franchise, this TM teaches the powerful Electric-type move **Thunder**. It represents a high-tier offensive resource.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). This price point reflects its status as a high-power, "end-game" move usually found in Department Stores or late-game locations.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Thunder** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile (Thunder):** A high-intensity Electric-type attack with 110 Power (120 in older generations) and 70% Accuracy. It has a 30% chance to paralyze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have 0 power).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Thunder is a mandatory pick for **Rain-based teams** (utilizing the Drizzle ability), as the move's accuracy increases to 100% during rain. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like Kyogre, Zapdos, and Pelipper to bypass its low base accuracy.
* **Special Interactions:** 
    * Thunder can hit Pokémon in the semi-invulnerable state of moves like **Fly, Bounce, and Sky Drop**.
    * Accuracy drops to 50% in **Harsh Sunlight**.
    * *Note on Version Variance:* While the `effect_entries` specify Thunder, the `flavor_text` in the provided data mentions "protect itself from all attacks," which refers to the move **Protect**. In **Pokémon Sword & Shield**, TM25 was reassigned to Protect, though in almost every other generation (including Gen 9), TM25 remains Thunder.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Department Stores:** Historically purchasable at the Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove, and Veilstone Department Stores.
    * **Overworld:** Often found in locations associated with electricity, such as the **Power Plant** (Kanto) or **Lake of Outrage** (Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. TMs are traditionally acquired via exploration, Gym Leader rewards, or high-end retail in-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Electric-types and "specially" gifted Pokémon (like Nidoking or Starmie) that have diverse movepools.
