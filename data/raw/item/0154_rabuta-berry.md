## Identity & Utility
**Rabuta-berry** is a **Baking-only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized agricultural item used primarily for crafting Pokémon treats. In the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions, it is a key ingredient for producing high-quality Pokéblocks and Poffins to enhance a Pokémon's Contest conditions. It is a consumable item that can be planted in soft soil to yield more berries.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Unlike medicinal berries (such as Oran or Lum), the Rabuta Berry has no direct effect on HP or status conditions in battle. Its utility is restricted to the **Pokémon Contest** sub-game, where it is used to increase the **Smartness** and **Toughness** stats of a Pokémon through cooking.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely low damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Water-type** attack with 90 Power (Gen IV-V) or 70 Power (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a niche item for collectors or Contest enthusiasts and holds no value in VGC, Smogon, or standard battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This berry is not a trigger for evolution. It is compatible with the **Harvest** ability for recycling and the **Pickup** ability in specific games, though it is rarely a priority for these mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained by talking to the Berry Master or his wife in the Hoenn region, or by finding it on specific routes (e.g., Route 208) in Sinnoh. It is often a reward for players who engage in the agricultural and culinary side-quests of the series.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon according to current data. Acquisition relies on finding it in the overworld, receiving it from NPCs, or farming it through planting and watering.
* **Lore context:** The name and appearance are inspired by the real-world **Rambutan**. Its flavor profile is primarily **Sour** and **Bitter**, which is why it translates into "Smartness" points when processed into sweets.
