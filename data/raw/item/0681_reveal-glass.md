## Identity & Utility
**Reveal Glass** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation V** (specifically Pokémon Black 2 & White 2).
* **Description:** A mysterious looking glass said to reveal the "truth." It is a specialized form-change tool used to transition specific Legendary Pokémon between their distinct biological states. It is a **Key Item** that is **not for sale** and remains in the player's inventory indefinitely upon acquisition.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on **Tornadus**, **Thundurus**, **Landorus**, or **Enamorus**, it toggles them between their **Incarnate Forme** and their **Therian Forme**.
    * **Incarnate Forme:** The default "Genie" appearance, generally focused on higher Speed or balanced offensive stats.
    * **Therian Forme:** The "Animal" appearance (Bird, Dragon, Tiger, or Snake-like), which grants different base stats and specialized Abilities (e.g., Landorus-T gains *Intimidate*, Tornadus-T gains *Regenerator*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** The Reveal Glass is required to access Therian Formes, which are often top-tier threats in competitive formats (especially Landorus-Therian in Smogon OU/VGC and Tornadus-Therian in various singles tiers). 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution; it functions as a reversible transformation tool. It cannot be used during a battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained through special events or specific NPCs after the player has captured one of the "Forces of Nature." In its debut (B2W2), it was obtained by taking a Therian Forme Landorus (from the Dream Radar) to the Abyssal Ruins. In later generations, it is usually gifted by NPCs in markets (e.g., Stow-on-Side in Sword/Shield or Porto Marinada in Scarlet/Violet) if the player has a member of the trio in their party.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact tied to the lore of the Unova region’s legendary protectors.
