## Identity & Utility
**Electric Seed** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable seed that reacts to environmental electrical energy. It is a **single-use held item** that is consumed immediately upon the activation of Electric Terrain (or upon entry if the terrain is already active). 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** pricing for competitive items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is on the field during **Electric Terrain**, the item is consumed to increase the holder's **Defense by one stage** (+50%).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low; not recommended for use with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **niche staple** in competitive formats (VGC and Smogon). Its primary utility is not just the Defense boost, but the fact that it is **consumed instantly**. This makes it an elite choice for Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability (like Hawlucha, Drifblim, or Sneasler), as it doubles their Speed stat the moment they switch into Electric Terrain.
    * **Synergy:** It is almost exclusively paired with "Electric Surge" ability users such as **Tapu Koko**, **Pincurchin**, or **Miraidon**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It specifically interacts with the **Terrain** mechanic and serves as a trigger for abilities that require item consumption (e.g., Unburden, Acrobatics).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold in high-end specialty shops or Battle Frontier/Battle Tree marts in later generations. In Alola, it is associated with the region's unique natural energy.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is naturally occurring in the wild, held by **Togedemaru** (5% chance) and its Totem variant. It can be efficiently farmed using the **Pickup** ability or moves like **Thief** and **Covet** when encountering wild Togedemaru.
