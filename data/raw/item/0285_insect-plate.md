## Identity & Utility
**Insect Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with Bug-type energy. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is holdable and active in battle. While it has a data-defined cost, it is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically treated as a collectible or rare find.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily found through exploration rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Boosts the power of the holder's **Bug-type moves by 20%**. Additionally, if held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (specifically Arceus), the holder’s primary type changes to Bug.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High base power for the move Fling, but the item is consumed upon use).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **required staple** for running the **Arceus-Bug** form in Uber tiers. For non-Arceus Pokémon, it serves as a niche offensive item, providing a 1.2x damage multiplier to Bug moves without the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking of a Choice item. It is functionally identical to the *Silver Powder*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Judgment:** Changes the type of the move *Judgment* to Bug-type when held by Arceus.
    * **Ability Synergy:** Directly interacts with the **Multitype** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through exploration. Its `underground` attribute highlights its origin in the **Sinnoh Grand Underground** (via mining). In other generations, it is often found in specific ruins, underwater locations (via Dive), or provided by NPCs who study myths.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It must be found in the overworld or via special mechanics like the Underground or the Pickup ability in specific legacy titles.
* **Lore context:** One of the many plates said to be fragments of the primordial power used by Arceus to shape the universe. The inscription on the back (though not in the JSON) typically alludes to the creation of the world.
