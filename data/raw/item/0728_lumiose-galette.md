## Identity & Utility
**Lumiose-galette** is a **Consumable Medicine** (Status-cure) introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A popular regional treat originating from Lumiose City. It functions as a specialized local delicacy that can be used from the bag to fully restore a Pokémon's condition. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at specific vendors within its debut region.
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Heals a Pokémon of all major status ailments (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) as well as Confusion. It is mechanically identical to a **Full Heal**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None/Playthrough Only.** Like all bag-accessed medicines, it is prohibited in standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon). It is highly valuable in **Nuzlockes** or casual playthroughs as a cost-effective alternative to Full Heals (which typically cost 400-600 Poké Dollars).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Regional Specialty" item group, which includes items like the Lava Cookie, Old Gateau, and Casteliacone.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily sold at the **Galette Shop** on North Boulevard in Lumiose City. In Gen VI, availability was time-restricted (sold at certain hours of the day). In later generations, it occasionally appears as a reward from NPCs or specialized shops (like the Battle Tree or regional vendors).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is generally acquired via direct purchase or as a souvenir gift from NPCs. In some games, it may be found by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at specific level tiers.
