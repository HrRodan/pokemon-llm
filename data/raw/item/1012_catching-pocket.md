It is an internal organizational "pocket" rather than a tangible item that can be used or held by a Pokémon. It is **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Internal System Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics

* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a system-level organizational entry and does not exist within the competitive meta-game or standard battle scenarios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not interact with any Pokémon, abilities (such as Pickup), or evolution mechanics.
