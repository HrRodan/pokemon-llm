## Identity & Utility
**Contest Costume (Dress)** is a cosmetic Key Item categorized as **Unused** in the Generation VII data.
* **Description:** A specialized, "very cute" dress designed specifically for the female protagonist to wear during the **Contest Spectacular** minigame. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought or sold. While it appears in the internal data for Generation VII (Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon), its primary functionality is rooted in the Hoenn region remakes.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When participating in a Pokémon Contest Spectacular, the player character automatically changes into this outfit. It serves a purely aesthetic purpose, enhancing the visual presentation of the trainer during the introduction and appeal phases of the contest.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no impact on Pokémon battles, stats, or abilities. It is strictly a flavor and roleplay element for the Contest Spectacular side-activity.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of two gender-specific costumes (the other being the Contest Costume Suit for male protagonists).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, this item is given to the female player character by the Contest Idol **Lisia** upon first entering the Contest Hall in Slateport City. In Generation VII (Alola), the item exists within the game's internal code but is not obtainable or usable through normal gameplay, explaining its "Unused" category status.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. This is a unique item tied to the player character's progression in the Contest circuit.
