## Identity & Utility
**Max Repel** is a **Spelunking Utility** item introduced in **Generation I** (indexed as Generation IV in this dataset's specific context).
* **Description:** An advanced aerosol spray used to ward off wild Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item used outside of battle to navigate caves and tall grass without interruption. It represents the highest tier of the Repel hierarchy (Repel < Super Repel < Max Repel).
* **Cost:** 900 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Premium**). While it provides the longest duration, it is mathematically less cost-efficient per step than the Super Repel, trading currency for player convenience.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used, it prevents encounters with wild Pokémon whose level is lower than the Pokémon currently in the first slot of the player's party. This effect persists for **250 steps**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely overworld utility item and provides no benefit in VGC, Smogon, or in-game Trainer battles.
* **Special Interaction (Repel Trick):** Experienced trainers use Max Repels for "Repel Manipulation." By placing a lead Pokémon of a specific level, players can filter out common low-level spawns to forced-encounter rare, higher-level species on a route.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available at Poké Marts and Department Stores once the player has earned a specific number of Gym Badges (typically mid-to-late game). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through retail or found as "Item Balls" in late-game maps and dungeons.
* **Usage Context:** Essential for **Speedrunning** and **Nuzlocke challenges**, where it is used to bypass unwanted encounters or strategically guarantee encounters in specific sub-areas of a route.
