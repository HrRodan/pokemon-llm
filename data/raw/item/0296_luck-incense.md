## Identity & Utility
**Luck Incense** is a **Training/Economic Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An exotic-smelling incense that stimulates financial fortune. It is a permanent **Held Item** that is not consumed upon use. Unlike most standard training items, it serves a dual purpose as both a wealth-generator and a biological catalyst for breeding.
* **Cost:** 11,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Luxury purchase**). Its high price point reflects its long-term ROI (Return on Investment) for trainers.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holding Pokémon participates in a trainer battle (even for one turn), the prize money awarded at the end of the battle is **doubled**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely low damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The item provides no statistical or tactical advantage in battle. It is strictly a "Playthrough" or "Post-game Farming" tool used to fund expensive items like Vitamins, TMs, or fashion accessories.
    * **Stacking:** It **does not stack** with the **Amulet Coin** or other Luck Incenses. The maximum multiplier for prize money remains 2x regardless of how many Pokémon hold these items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding (Baby Trigger):** It is the essential catalyst for the Chansey line. When a **Chansey** or **Blissey** holds the Luck Incense while at the Pokémon Nursery/Day Care, the resulting Egg will hatch into a **Happiny**. Without this item, the Egg will hatch directly into a Chansey.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically purchased from specialized Incense Merchants (e.g., the herb shop in Slateport City, the incense stall in Hulbury, or the Veilstone Department Store). It is also frequently found as a hidden item in cave systems (like the Ravaged Path in Sinnoh).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or found in the overworld.
* **World Knowledge:** The Luck Incense was introduced alongside several other incenses in Gen IV to explain why "Baby Pokémon" (like Happiny, Munchlax, and Budew) weren't discovered in earlier generations; the specific scents are lore-contexualized as the "trigger" for these specific biological outcomes.
