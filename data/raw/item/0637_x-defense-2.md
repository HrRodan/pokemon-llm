## Identity & Utility
**X-Defense 2** is a **Consumable Battle Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, battle-only enhancement item designed for use within the Wonder Launcher system. It is a more potent version of the standard X Defense, specifically engineered to provide immediate physical durability. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot** be bought with standard currency or used in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired exclusively through the accumulation of points during a Wonder Launcher-enabled battle.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon during battle, it **sharply raises the target's Defense stat by two stages** (a 100% increase from the base stat). This effect is temporary and is lost if the Pokémon is switched out of battle or if the battle ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Legacy.** This item is entirely restricted to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic found in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. It is not permitted in standard VGC (Video Game Championships) or Smogon formats, as it bypasses the standard "no items from bag" rule of competitive play. It is considered a "Tier 2" defensive buff within that specific sub-mode.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a combat buff. It cannot be used if the Pokémon's Defense stat has already reached the maximum of +6 stages.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Only available within multiplayer battles where the **Wonder Launcher** setting is toggled "On." Players must wait for their point gauge to fill to the required amount to "purchase" and use the item mid-turn. It does not occupy space in the player's standard Bag outside of these matches.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital/technological construct of the Wonder Launcher system rather than a physical medicinal item like a Potion or a standard X-Item found in Poké Marts.
