## Identity & Utility
**Fidough Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item is a specialized crafting resource used at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon but serves as currency for move acquisition. It can be sold for a small amount of Poké Dollars or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a required ingredient for crafting specific TMs. In the Paldea region, it is notably used to create moves such as **TM002 (Charm)** and **TM019 (Disarming Voice)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle preparation phase, allowing trainers to teach competitive moves to their team members via the TM Machine.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM crafting system introduced in the ninth generation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching members of the Fidough evolutionary line in the wild. It is a common drop in the early-game areas of the Paldea region. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is automatically awarded to the player's "TM Materials" pocket upon a successful encounter with wild **Fidough** or **Dachsbun**. It is frequently gathered in large quantities while exploring the South Province and other grassy biomes.
