## Identity & Utility
**Dunsparce Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting reagent dropped by members of the Dunsparce evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or overworld movement. It is primarily managed via the TM Machine at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap). While it has a sell price, its primary value is its conversion rate into League Points (LP) or its use as a component in move creation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, these scales are combined with League Points (LP) to synthesize moves such as **TM078 (Dragon Tail)** or **TM110 (Drill Run)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly. However, it is essential for the "Prep Phase" of competitive play, as it is required to teach Dunsparce or other compatible Pokémon high-tier coverage moves that cannot be learned through leveling up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine mechanic. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop reward after defeating or catching a wild **Dunsparce** or **Dudunsparce**. These items are automatically added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not traditionally "held" in the same way as a Leftovers or Life Orb, these scales are a guaranteed drop from wild Dunsparce found in grassy biomes or caves (such as Area Zero or the Dalizapa Passage). They are frequently farmed by players looking to optimize Ground or Dragon-type move sets for their team.
