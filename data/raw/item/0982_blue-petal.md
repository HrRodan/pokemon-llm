## Identity & Utility
**Blue Petal** is a **Key Item** (categorized as a quest component) introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Pokémon Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** A pressed flower petal received from the Trial Captain Lana. It serves as one of the seven necessary components for completing Mina’s Captain Trial on Poni Island. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item has no direct effect in battle or on Pokémon stats. Its sole purpose is to act as a **progression marker**. Once the player collects all seven colored petals (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Pink, and Purple), they are combined into the **Rainbow Flower**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This is a story-essential item used exclusively during the main narrative of the Alola region sequels.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is a required trigger for the final stage of Mina's trial, leading to the battle against the Totem Pokémon, **Ribombee**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained via a scripted event in *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*. The player must travel to **Brooklet Hill** and defeat (or interact with) **Trial Captain Lana**, who awards the petal to the player.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is unique to the player's inventory as part of the "Island Challenge" lore of the Alola region.
* **Context:** Unlike the original *Sun and Moon* games, the *Ultra* versions expanded Mina's role, turning her trial into a "boss rush" of sorts where the player revisits previous Captains. The Blue Petal represents the player's history and bond with the Water-type specialist Lana.
