## Identity & Utility
**Fried Food** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A greasy, pre-fried cooking component used exclusively at the Pokémon Camp. While described as having "gotten greasy" over time, it remains a viable staple for Galar-style cooking. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 150 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during the Pokémon Camp cooking minigame, it serves as the key ingredient to create various tiers of the **Fried-Food Curry**. Depending on the Berries added and the quality of the cooking, this curry restores a Pokémon's HP and PP, grants Experience Points, and increases Friendliness.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be used in battle and provides no passive buffs when held. It is strictly a "Playthrough/Collection" item for completing the Curry Dex and maintaining team health during a Galar journey.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the **Curry Dex** mechanic in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Ingredient Sellers** found throughout the Galar **Wild Area**, the Isle of Armor, and the Crown Tundra. Its stock rotates daily alongside other cooking staples like Sausages or Instant Noodles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is restricted to purchasing from NPCs or occasionally receiving it as a reward for interacting with other players' camps in the Wild Area.
* **Lore Context:** Its description as "greasy" reflects the Galar region's inspiration from British cuisine (specifically "chippy" culture), providing a thematic touch to the regional "Curry-on-Rice" obsession.
