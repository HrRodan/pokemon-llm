## Identity & Utility
**Bitter Herba Mystica** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A rare, legendary condiment found within the Paldea region, originally guarded by Titan Pokémon during the "Path of Legends" storyline. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that **cannot be bought** in any standard Poké Mart or specialty shop.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through high-level gameplay).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively in the **Sandwich-making** mechanic at picnics. When used as an ingredient, it provides a massive boost to Meal Power points. Most notably, combining any two Herba Mystica (including the Bitter variant) is the standard method for triggering **Sparkling Power Lv. 3**, **Title Power Lv. 3**, and **Humungo/Teensy Power Lv. 3**. 
* **Flavor Profile:** As the name suggests, it provides a "Bitter" flavor profile to sandwiches, which specifically influences the resulting Meal Powers toward **Item Drop Power** and **Exp. Point Power** when not combined with other specific Herba Mystica types.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is entirely restricted to the **Overworld** and the **Shiny Hunting** meta-game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, in the story of *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, these herbs are used to restore the health and traversal abilities (Sprinting, Swimming, Gliding) of **Koraidon** or **Miraidon**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Bitter Herba Mystica is a rare reward drop obtained exclusively by defeating **5-Star and 6-Star Tera Raid Battles**. It is considered an "end-game" or "post-game" resource due to the difficulty of these raids.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard ingredients, it cannot be found on the ground or purchased at Deli Cioso or Sure Cans. It must be "farmed" through repeated high-level Tera Raids, making it one of the most sought-after items for competitive Shiny hunters and completionists.
