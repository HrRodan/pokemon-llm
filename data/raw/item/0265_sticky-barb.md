## Identity & Utility
**Sticky Barb** is a **Competitive Held Item (Negative Utility)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A sharp, thorny item designed to be held by a Pokémon. It functions as a persistent damage-over-time hazard for the holder while possessing the unique ability to "latch on" to opponents who make physical contact. It is a **Held Item** that can be bought or found in the wild.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for specialized battle items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** At the end of every turn, the holder of the Sticky Barb loses **1/8 (12.5%) of its maximum HP**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Transfer Mechanic:** If the holder is hit by a **contact move** and the attacker is not currently holding an item, the Sticky Barb will transfer to the attacker. The attacker also takes 1/8 of their max HP in damage upon the initial contact.
    * **Fling Power:** **80** (High damage for a Fling-based attack, making it a viable option to forcibly "gift" the item to an opponent).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Niche Strategic Item**. It is primarily used with moves like **Trick** or **Switcheroo** to cripple an opponent's wall or sweeper. It is also uniquely viable on Pokémon with the **Magic Guard** ability (such as Clefable or Reuniclus), who ignore the passive damage but can still transfer the barb to physical attackers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts negatively with most Pokémon but synergizes with **Klutz** (the holder ignores the damage but can still transfer it) and **Magic Guard**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available in late-game department stores or battle-specific shops (like the Battle Frontier or BP shops in various regions).
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently found on "thorny" or "prickly" wild Pokémon, specifically **Cacnea**, **Cacturne**, **Ferroseed**, and **Ferrothorn**. These can be farmed efficiently using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet**.
