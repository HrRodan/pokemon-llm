## Identity & Utility
**Passimian Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents a tuft of fur dropped by a Passimian. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various TMs. It cannot be used directly on a Pokémon or held for a battle benefit.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Ingredient Value). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific required ingredient for crafting TMs in the Paldea region. When combined with League Points (LP) and other materials, it allows the player to "print" specific move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression and customization item used exclusively in the overworld menu or at Pokémon Centers; it has no presence in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource gathered through exploration and combat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild Passimian. It is also a potential reward from Tera Raid Battles featuring Passimian.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense for the player to steal, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop from wild **Passimian**. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, these are typically found in forested areas like **Tagtree Thicket** or **North Province (Area Two)**. (Note: Passimian is a version-exclusive to Pokémon Violet, meaning Scarlet players must trade for the Pokémon or join a Violet player's Union Circle to farm this material).
