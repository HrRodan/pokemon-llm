## Identity & Utility
**TM66 (Payback)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This data disc is used to teach the Dark-type move **Payback** to compatible Pokémon. As a Technical Machine, its usage mechanics have shifted over generations: historically a single-use consumable in its debut, it became infinite-use in mid-generations, and returned to a craftable/consumable format in more recent titles.
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its status as a high-value tactical move typically found in late-game Department Stores or specialized outlets.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Payback**. The move is a physical Dark-type attack where the user stores power and strikes. If the user moves after the target (either due to a lower Speed stat or the opponent switching out), the move’s base power doubles from 50 to **100**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be Flung or have a base power of 0 if attempted).
    * **Competitive Use:** This TM is a staple for **slow, bulky attackers** and "tank" archetypes. It is frequently seen on Pokémon like **Umbreon, Machamp, and Conkeldurr**. It is particularly effective in competitive formats (Smogon/VGC) to punish faster offensive threats or to catch an opponent on a predicted switch-in.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, primarily those with physical attacking biases and lower Speed tiers.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM66 has been consistently available across every major region since Sinnoh (Gen IV to Gen IX). Given its 30,000 Poké Dollar price tag, it is usually purchased at major commerce hubs like the **Veilstone Department Store** or provided as a reward for navigating difficult routes (e.g., Route 215 in Sinnoh).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through Department Stores, NPC gifts, or the TM Machine (in Paldea) using League Points and specific Pokémon materials.
