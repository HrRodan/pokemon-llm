## Identity & Utility
**Fairy Feather** is a **Held Item (Type-Enhancer)** introduced in **Generation IX**.
* **Description:** A soft, magical feather that radiates a faint pink glow. It is a **Held Item** that provides a consistent power boost to specific move types. Unlike "plates" or "incense," it is a standard type-specific accessory that can be bought and sold easily.
* **Cost:** 750 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of **Fairy-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard physical impact; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Niche/Reliable Staple** for Fairy-type attackers (such as Flutter Mane or Sylveon) in formats where the player wants to avoid the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking restriction of Choice Specs. It is particularly effective for Pokémon using the **Pixilate** ability, as the boosted moves benefit from both the ability multiplier and the feather's bonus.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any known evolutions. It is purely a combat-utility item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Paldea region, it can be purchased at **Delibird Presents** shops (specifically the Cascarrafa branch) after the player has earned enough Gym Badges. It can also be found as a sparkling "hidden item" in areas with high Fairy-type concentrations, such as the **Tagtree Thicket**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Currently not associated with any specific wild Pokémon held-item tables. It is primarily gathered through overworld exploration or retail purchase.
