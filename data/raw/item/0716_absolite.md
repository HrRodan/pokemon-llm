## Identity & Utility
**Absolite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed for a specific species. When held by Absol, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired as a unique find or through special post-game events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If held by an Absol, the Trainer can trigger a Mega Evolution at the start of a turn. This transforms Absol into **Mega Absol**, significantly increasing its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats, and changing its ability to **Magic Bounce**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In most competitive formats, Mega Stones cannot be removed by moves like Trick, Switcheroo, or Knock Off if held by the correct Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** A staple for players utilizing Absol. Mega Absol serves as a powerful "Glass Cannon" and a utility counter-lead due to **Magic Bounce**, which reflects non-damaging moves (like Stealth Rock, Taunt, or Will-O-Wisp) back at the opponent.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is not a permanent evolution item but a temporary battle mechanic. It only interacts with **Absol**. It is immune to most item-removal mechanics while held by Absol.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in fixed locations or gifted by NPCs after proving one's worth as a Trainer. In its debut (Kalos), it was obtained in Kiloude City; in Hoenn (ORAS), it was discovered in the Safari Zone. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a rare treasure tied to the lore of Mega Evolution and the bond between Trainer and Pokémon.
