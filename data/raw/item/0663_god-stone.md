## Identity & Utility
**God-stone** is an **Unused Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Described simply as "A rare stone," it exists within the game's internal data but lacks any functional scripts or overworld triggers. It is categorized as a **Key Item-style artifact** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** None. The item is coded into the game but has no associated function, event, or script. It does not occupy a space in the player's inventory through normal gameplay.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is "cut content" and serves no purpose in Smogon, VGC, or standard playthroughs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While its name suggests a connection to the "Light Stone" (Reshiram) and "Dark Stone" (Zekrom), it does **not** trigger the evolution or form change of any Pokémon, including Kyurem. In *Pokémon Black 2 and White 2*, the "DNA Splicers" served the mechanical role this item was likely intended for.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unavailable** through legitimate gameplay. It can only be viewed or obtained via external hardware or save-data modification (cheating).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** Within the Pokémon community and data-mining history, the God-stone is widely recognized as the "Third Stone" of the Unova Dragon Trio. It was intended to represent **Kyurem** in its dormant state, mirroring how Reshiram and Zekrom are encountered. However, Game Freak opted to have Kyurem appear in its physical form within the Giant Chasm (BW) and used the DNA Splicers for its fusion mechanic (B2W2), leaving the God-stone as an orphaned asset in the game's code.
