## Identity & Utility
**Professor's Mask** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** This item is the signature headgear of "The Masked Royal." It is a unique Key Item that cannot be used in battle, sold to vendors, or held by Pokémon for competitive benefit. Its purpose is strictly narrative, serving as a bridge between the player and Professor Kukui’s secret persona.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The mask serves as a quest item. In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, the player recovers the mask after it is "lost" by Professor Kukui (specifically found in Malie Garden). Returning or possessing the mask triggers specific dialogue and character development regarding Kukui’s double life as a battle royale professional wrestler.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item has no mechanical impact on battle stats, abilities, or move-sets. It is a "Dead Item" in a competitive VGC or Smogon context.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or trigger any mechanical changes to the party. It is purely for world-building and plot progression.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as part of the main story in the Alola region. In the games, it is typically found in **Malie Garden** on Ula'ula Island after the player defeats Guzma and Team Skull. 
* **Lore context:** The flavor text notes that the Masked Royal is highly dedicated to his craft, even sewing his own masks on a machine. While the game treats the "identity" of the Masked Royal as a poorly kept secret, the mask represents Kukui's passion for the "spirit of Alolan battle."
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability.
