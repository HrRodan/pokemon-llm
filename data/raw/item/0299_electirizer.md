## Identity & Utility
**Electirizer** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized box packed with a tremendous amount of electric energy. It functions as a single-use catalyst for specific evolutionary lines. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is generally **not available in standard Poké Marts**, requiring special acquisition or discovery.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate; though its value lies more in its rarity than its sell price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by an **Electabuzz** and traded to another trainer, it triggers an evolution into **Electivire**. The item is consumed and disappears after the evolution process is complete.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Notably high damage for a non-competitive item, making it a viable—though expensive—one-time projectile).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself holds no strategic value in battle. However, it is the essential "gatekeeper" item for obtaining Electivire, a high-tier physical attacker utilized for its *Motor Drive* ability. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically facilitates the transition from the mid-stage Electabuzz to the final-stage Electivire. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, the mechanic is simplified to direct consumption (functioning like an Evolution Stone).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually located in areas with high electrical activity (such as the Valley Windworks, Power Plants, or Mount Coronet). In later generations, it is often sold by specialized vendors for Battle Points (BP) or Merit Points.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is frequently found as a rare held item on wild **Elekid**, **Electabuzz**, and occasionally **Electivire**. Trainers often farm this item using the **Pickup** ability or by using **Thief/Covet** on wild encounters.
