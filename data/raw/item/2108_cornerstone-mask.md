## Identity & Utility
**Cornerstone Mask** is a specialized **Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask DLC)**.
* **Description:** A weathered stone mask that embodies the resilience of the earth. It is a unique form-altering item specifically designed for the Legendary Pokémon **Ogerpon**. It cannot be bought, sold, or traded, functioning similarly to a Mega Stone or Griseous Orb in terms of its exclusivity to a specific species.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story progression in the Kitakami region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Ogerpon**, it triggers a permanent form change into **Cornerstone Mask Ogerpon**. This transformation alters Ogerpon's secondary type to **Rock** (making it Grass/Rock) and changes its Ability to **Sturdy**. Additionally, the mask provides a passive **1.2x (20%) damage boost** to all of Ogerpon's moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be thrown via Fling, nor can it be removed by moves like Knock Off or stolen via Thief/Covet when held by Ogerpon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** In VGC and Smogon formats, the Cornerstone Mask is highly valued for transforming Ogerpon into a premier offensive check to Flying, Fire, and Ice types. Its access to a Rock-type *Ivy Cudgel* (which has a high critical-hit ratio) combined with the **Sturdy** ability makes it a potent "anti-meta" pick that can survive powerful hits and retaliate with high-accuracy Rock-type STAB.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Terastallization:** If Ogerpon Terastallizes while holding this mask, it gains the **Cornerstone Tera Form**. Its Ability shifts to **Embody Aspect**, which grants an immediate **+1 Defense boost** upon Terastallization.
    * **Move Modification:** Changes the move *Ivy Cudgel* from Grass-type to **Rock-type**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the climax of the **The Teal Mask** expansion storyline after defeating Ogerpon in its Cornerstone Mask form. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. It is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be generated via the Pickup ability.
* **Lore context:** The mask represents one of the four legendary masks worn by Ogerpon to hide its identity and draw upon different elemental powers; the Cornerstone Mask specifically represents the power of the mountain and the stony cliffs of Kitakami.
