## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (★Ori2004)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Upon use, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (Larvitar) that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Special Consumable** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal value, it is historically obtained via promotional codes or pre-order bonuses rather than currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it activates a Max Raid Battle. The beam produced is unique, and the encounter is guaranteed regardless of the current weather or standard den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used to facilitate a capture. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess high Individual Values (IVs) and potentially Hidden Abilities, making them ideal parents for competitive breeding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (`ori2004`) is tied to the **Larvitar** encounter. This allowed *Pokémon Sword* players to obtain the Shield-exclusive Larvitar line early in the game (and vice-versa for the Jangmo-o crystal).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **Pre-order Bonus** for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack* or through retail-specific distributions (such as the Pokémon Center or Amazon). It is not available in Poké Marts or from NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended to bridge version-exclusive gaps or provide early-game access to pseudo-legendary evolutionary lines.
* **Nuzlocke/Playthrough Note:** In specialized runs, this item is highly valued as it guarantees an encounter with a powerful Tyranitar-line Pokémon, which is otherwise restricted by version or late-game progression.
