## Identity & Utility
**TM98** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation VI**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching disc that allows a Pokémon to learn the move **Stomping Tantrum** (based on provided flavor text). It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game version) that **Can** be bought at various outlets.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Stomping Tantrum** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Type:** Ground (Physical).
    * **Specific Mechanic:** This move has a base power of 75, which doubles to **150** if the user’s previous move failed in the same turn (e.g., the move missed, the target used Protect, or the move was neutralized).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have no base power assigned).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/High Utility.** Stomping Tantrum is a staple for physical attackers needing Ground-type coverage, particularly in VGC (Doubles) where moves are frequently blocked by *Protect* or *Wide Guard*, allowing for a massive 150-power retaliation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a vital tool for expanding the movepools of Physical attackers that lack naturally learned Ground-type moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly available for purchase at **Pokémon Marts** or the **Battle Tower** depending on the region (Kalos, Alola, Galar, or Paldea). At 1,000 Poké Dollars, it is considered a budget-friendly addition to a trainer's arsenal.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically manufactured as a high-tech data disc for trainer use.
* **Historical Note:** While this specific data entry describes **Stomping Tantrum** (the Gen VIII identity of TM98), the move contained within TM98 has changed over time:
    * **Gen VI:** Power-Up Punch
    * **Gen VII:** Waterfall
    * **Gen VIII:** Stomping Tantrum
