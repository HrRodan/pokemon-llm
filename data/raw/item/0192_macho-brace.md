## Identity & Utility
**Macho Brace** is an **Effort-Training Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A stiff and heavy brace designed to be held by a Pokémon. It is a specialized training tool that promotes accelerated stat growth at the cost of physical mobility. It is a **Holdable Utility** item that can be bought or sold for a moderate price.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Price**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon earns **double the Effort Values (EVs)** it would normally receive from defeating an opponent. For example, if a defeated Pokémon normally yields 1 Attack EV, the holder of the Macho Brace will receive 2 Attack EVs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Speed Penalty:** The holder's current Speed stat is reduced by **50%** in battle. This effect is temporary and only lasts as long as the item is held.
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Moderate physical damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility/Niche.** This item is almost never used in serious competitive play (VGC/Smogon) because the Speed drop is a massive tactical disadvantage. It is strictly a **grinding tool** used during the "EV Training" phase of team preparation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * Does not trigger any evolutions. 
    * Its effects are negated by the ability **Klutz**. 
    * In later generations, it has largely been superseded by the "Power Items" (e.g., Power Weight, Power Bracer), which provide a flat +8 EV bonus per knockout, though the Macho Brace remains useful for its multiplicative effect on all stats simultaneously.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through specific NPC interactions rather than standard Marts. In its debut (Hoenn), it is famously rewarded by the **Winstrate Family** after defeating them in sequence. In other regions, it is often found in specialized shops or exchanged for Battle Points (BP).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a manufactured training device rather than a biological or found object. While not obtainable via **Pickup**, it is a essential tool for trainers looking to optimize their Pokémon's potential through manual labor.
