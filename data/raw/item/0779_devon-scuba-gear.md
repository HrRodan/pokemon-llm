## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Devon Scuba Gear allows the player character to survive and navigate underwater environments when using the move **Dive**.

    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld navigation and plot progression. It cannot be held by a Pokémon or used in any battle format.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*, the item is gifted to the player by **Steven Stone** after the player defeats/catches the super-ancient Pokémon (Kyogre or Groudon) or as part of the preparation for the seafloor expedition. It is not obtainable via standard gameplay in Generation VII (Alola), despite its presence in the game's internal item list.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind technological marvel from the Devon Corporation, the same entity responsible for the PokéNav and various Poké Ball innovations.
