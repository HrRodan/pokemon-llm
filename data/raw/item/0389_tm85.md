## Identity & Utility
**TM85 (Dream Eater)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach the move **Dream Eater** to compatible Pokémon. It is a consumable teaching tool (in most generations) that provides a specialized offensive recovery option. 
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In many regions, this price point reflects its status as a specialized TM often found in Department Stores or as a reward for late-game exploration.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dream Eater**. When used in battle, the user deals Psychic-type damage to a target and recovers HP equal to 50% of the damage dealt.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Strict Requirement:** The move **only works if the target is currently Asleep**. If the target is awake or wakes up the turn the move is used, the move will fail completely.
    * **Move Power:** 100 Base Power / 100% Accuracy (Special).
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard for TMs; they cannot be flung for damage in competitive play).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Gimmick.** While powerful, Dream Eater is rarely used in high-level competitive play (Smogon/VGC) because it relies on the "Sleep" status, which can be bypassed by switching out or "Sleep Clause" rules. It is most effective when paired with high-accuracy sleep moves like **Spore** or **Lovely Kiss**, or used by fast Pokémon like **Gengar**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is a signature thematic move for "dream-based" Pokémon like **Drowzee, Hypno, and Musharna**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM85 is widely available across multiple regions from Generation IV through Generation IX. 
    * In **Sinnoh**, it is found at Lake Valor. 
    * In **Unova**, it is gifted by an NPC in the Dreamyard. 
    * In later generations, it often appears in Technical Machine Machine (TMM) crafting lists or high-end Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM85 is not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally an environmental pick-up or a store-bought item. Its utility is highest in single-player "Nuzlocke" runs where the player can reliably predict AI behavior to land Sleep moves.
