## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal VEL3634** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a consumable event-specific item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When taken to the Watchtower Lair (an empty stone ruin in the North Lake Miloch area), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Utility** item that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; primarily acquired via external Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the Watchtower Lair, the crystal is consumed to summon a specific Dynamax Pokémon (the identity of which is determined by the specific crystal ID, such as Gigantamax Copperajah, Duraludon, or Larvitar/Jangmo-o depending on the promotional tie-in). The raid remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no direct impact on competitive battling. Its value lies entirely in providing access to rare Pokémon, often with high Individual Values (IVs), Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax factors, which are then used to breed or train competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are typically **Event-Exclusive**. They were distributed via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as Best Buy, GameStop, or Pokémon Center stores) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* Expansion Pass or Double Pack.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a promotional distribution item.
