## Identity & Utility
**Clever Mochi** is a **Vitamin (EV-Enhancer)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically the *The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** A sweet, specialized mochi snack that boosts a Pokémon's base stats. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used to fine-tune a Pokémon's defensive capabilities. While it has a technical internal cost, it is primarily an earned reward rather than a retail item.
* **Cost:** 125 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though primarily obtained through gameplay rewards).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a single Pokémon's **Special Defense Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. Unlike older "Feather" items which only grant 1 EV, Mochi acts with the same potency as traditional Vitamins (like Zinc) but is often easier to accumulate in bulk through regional mini-games.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** It is a staple for competitive players in the Scarlet/Violet era for rapid EV training. It allows trainers to maximize a Pokémon's Special Defense (up to the 252 EV cap) without relying on expensive shops or repetitive wild battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a suite of Mochi items (Health, Muscle, Resist, Genius, Clever, Swift) used for total stat customization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a reward for participating in the **Ogre Oustin'** mini-game at Kitakami Hall. The amount and type of Mochi received depend on the difficulty level cleared (Easy, Normal, or Hard).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, this is a man-made Kitakami specialty item gathered through local festival activities.
