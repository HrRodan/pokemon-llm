## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ERI1231)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized event item designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** ruins in the Galar Wild Area. Once consumed, it triggers a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon that persists until the end of the current day. It is a **Consumable Key-style Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically **Special Acquisition**; while a nominal value exists in the data, it is distributed via serial codes or promotions rather than sold in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area and has this crystal in their bag, it initiates a **Max Raid Battle** encounter. A beam of red light will appear at the ruins, and the player can challenge the specific Dynamax Pokémon associated with the crystal's ID.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for PvE (Player vs. Environment) encounters and collection purposes. It is used to obtain specific Pokémon, often with rare moves, hidden abilities, or Gigantamax factors, which can then be used in competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of limited-time retail promotions (such as those through CoroCoro, GameStop, or Pokémon Center events). Once used, the item is consumed and the raid remains active only until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a strictly external distribution item.
