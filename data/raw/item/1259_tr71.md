## Identity & Utility
**TR71 (Leaf Storm)** is a **Machine** (Technical Record) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** This Technical Record allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Leaf Storm**, a high-intensity Grass-type Special attack. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in Generation VIII, TRs are **consumable** and break after a single use. 
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily acquired through non-standard currency (Watts) or as a reward for high-level combat.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Leaf Storm**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Leaf Storm is a Special Grass-type move with **130 Base Power** and 90% Accuracy. Upon successful execution, the user's Special Attack stat is **harshly lowered (-2 stages)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 130. This is one of the highest possible Fling power values in the game, making it a devastating—albeit one-time—projectile if used with the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Utility.** Leaf Storm is a staple for Special-attacking Grass types (like Roserade or Sceptile) looking for a "nuke" option. It is famously synergistic with the Ability **Contrary** (notably on Serperior), which turns the -2 Special Attack penalty into a +2 boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Grass-type Pokémon and select non-Grass types with high Special Attack stat spreads.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR71 is primarily obtained by defeating Grass-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable price in Watts (usually 3,000–8,000 W).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally distributed as a reward for Raid successes, reflecting the high-tier power of the move it teaches.
