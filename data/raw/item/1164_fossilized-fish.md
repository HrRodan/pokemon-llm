## Identity & Utility
**Fossilized Fish** is a specialized **Dex-completion / Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A fossil remnant of an ancient marine Pokémon. Unlike traditional fossils, this item represents only a partial body segment (the head/front half) of a prehistoric creature. It is a **Consumable** item used specifically for resurrection mechanics and can be sold for a high price, though it is primarily sought for completing the Pokédex.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high purchase/sell value, it is primarily obtained through gameplay mechanics rather than standard Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the Fossil Lab on **Route 6** in Galar and given to the scientist **Cara Liss**, it can be combined with other fossils to create "chimera" prehistoric Pokémon.
    *   **Fossilized Fish + Fossilized Drake:** Results in **Dracovish** (Water/Dragon).
    *   **Fossilized Fish + Fossilized Bird:** Results in **Arctovish** (Water/Ice).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High). While it deals significant damage when thrown via the move Fling, the rarity and utility of the item make this a suboptimal use.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. However, it is the essential "key" to obtaining **Dracovish**, which became a **top-tier competitive staple** in Generation VIII due to its signature move, *Fishious Rend*, and the *Strong Jaw* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger standard evolution; instead, it acts as a "component" in a unique fusion-resurrection process. It is not held by wild Pokémon and does not interact with the Pickup ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Pokémon Shield**, it is a relatively common find from the **Digging Duo** (specifically the Skill brother) in the Wild Area.
    * In **Pokémon Sword**, it is extremely rare, often requiring multiple attempts with the Digging Duo or trading with a Shield player.
    * It can also be found as a hidden item in the Dusty Bowl or behind the Pokémon Center in Stow-on-Side.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to overworld discovery or the Digging Duo mechanic.
* **Lore Context:** The Fossilized Fish is part of a set of four "franken-fossils" in Galar that satirize early British paleontology mistakes, where mismatched bones were often assembled into incorrect creatures. The mystery mentioned in the flavor text refers to the fact that the "Fish" half never naturally matches the "Drake" or "Bird" halves it is fused with.
