## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ★Aqr7950** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used specifically within the Galar region's Wild Area. It is a single-use trigger that facilitates a Max Raid Battle. While the JSON lists a cost, it is functionally a "Special Acquisition" item that cannot be purchased through standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; typically distributed via serial code and not for retail sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—specifically a **Gigantamax Corviknight**—to appear as a Max Raid Battle. Once activated, the pillar of light remains active until the end of the day (midnight).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression/collection item used to obtain a competitive Pokémon, but it has no utility during a battle itself.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts with the **Max Raid** mechanic. It allows players to encounter a Pokémon with its Hidden Ability or Gigantamax Factor, which would otherwise require significant "RNG" or specific event windows to find.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (★Aqr7950) was historically distributed as a **pre-order bonus** for players who purchased the *Pokémon Sword* or *Pokémon Shield* Expansion Pass. It is not available through regular gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is strictly an event-exclusive inventory item. Its presence in the game's data serves as a key to unlock limited-time "special" dens for collectors and competitive breeders looking for early access to Gigantamax forms.
