## Identity & Utility
**Heart-Mail** is an **All-Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a distinctive print of giant heart patterns. It is a **Consumable Social Item** that can be purchased at various Poké Marts. It allows a Trainer to compose a customized message from a predetermined list of phrases and attach it to a Pokémon for delivery during trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates communication between Trainers during Pokémon trades. When held by a Pokémon, it carries a written message that can be read by the recipient. Once the message is read and erased, the item can be reused or stored in the Trainer's PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Defensive Utility.** Historically, Mail items were used in specific competitive tiers to block item-manipulating moves. While a Pokémon holds Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC**, and any move attempting to remove, steal, or swap the item (such as **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Trick**, or **Switcheroo**) will automatically fail.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Its primary mechanical interaction is the restriction of PC storage and immunity to item-removal effects, making the holder's "item slot" permanent until the Mail is manually removed by the player.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Sinnoh, Johto (HGSS), and Unova regions. It is typically found in the standard inventory of larger department stores (e.g., Veilstone Department Store).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or found as floor loot in specific overworld locations.
* **Historical Note:** As of Generation VI, Mail items were largely phased out of the core series gameplay, making Heart-Mail a legacy item primarily associated with the classic Nintendo DS era of Pokémon titles.
