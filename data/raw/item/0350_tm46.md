## Identity & Utility
**TM46** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** that has been a mainstay in the series since Generation I.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. From Generation II onwards, TM46 has taught **Thief**, a Dark-type physical move. In Generation I, it taught **Psywave**. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game generation) that is highly valued for its utility in both resource gathering and tactical combat.
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Premium**). The high price tag reflects its significant utility as a tool for permanent item acquisition in-game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Thief** to a compatible Pokémon. Thief deals damage (Base Power 60) and allows the user to steal the target's held item, provided the user is not already holding an item and the target's item is not protected (like a Mega Stone or Z-Crystal).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with Fling or have negligible power).
    * **Competitive Use:** While mostly a niche pick in high-level competitive play (Smogon/VGC), it is sometimes seen on "item-less" sets or Pokémon with the **Magician** ability. Its primary "competitive" value is actually in **In-Game Economy Management**, allowing players to steal rare items from NPCs or wild Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Essential for players looking to farm evolution items (like Metal Coats or King's Rocks) or rare consumables (like Heart Scales) from wild encounters.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, TM46 is often found in locations associated with stealth or crime, such as the **Team Rocket Hideout** (Kanto) or given by NPCs in shadowy areas. It is frequently sold in large Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove) for a premium price.
* **Wild Held Item:** While wild Pokémon do not hold TMs, the move taught by TM46 is the premier method for harvesting items from wild Pokémon such as **Luvdisc** (Heart Scales), **Magnemite** (Metal Coat), and **Butterfree** (Silver Powder). It is the mechanical opposite of the **Pickup** ability, requiring active usage in battle rather than passive collection.
