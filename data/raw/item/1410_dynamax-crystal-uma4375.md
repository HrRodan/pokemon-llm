## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal UMA4375** is a specialty **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed for use in the Galar region's Wild Area. When brought to the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay progression.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though effectively priceless as it is not sold in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Ruins of Watchtower in the Wild Area) while carrying this item, it consumes the crystal to spawn a specific Max Raid Battle. The raid remains active until the end of the calendar day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used solely to facilitate an encounter. However, the Pokémon caught via this crystal often possess Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors, which are highly relevant to the competitive meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not trigger evolution or interact with standard Pokémon abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals with specific ID codes (like UMA4375) were typically distributed via **Serial Codes** during special retail promotions (e.g., through CoroCoro in Japan or various international retailers). 
* **Specific Encounter:** While the flavor text uses a variable placeholder, internal data for this specific crystal index is associated with promotional encounters for **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly an event-exclusive distribution item.
