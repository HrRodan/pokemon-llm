## Identity & Utility
**TR89 (Hurricane)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A single-use device used to teach a Pokémon the powerful Flying-type move **Hurricane**. Unlike the infinite-use Technical Machines (TMs) of its generation, a Technical Record is consumed upon use, reflecting the high-power moves they typically contain. 
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for **Watts** (W) at Watt Traders in the Wild Area rather than purchased with standard currency at most Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Hurricane**. Hurricane is a high-risk, high-reward Flying-type special attack with a Base Power of 110 and an accuracy of 70%. It has a 30% chance to confuse the target. 
    * *Special Interaction:* The move's accuracy increases to 100% during **Rain** and decreases to 50% during **Harsh Sunlight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 110. This is exceptionally high, mirroring the move's base power, making it a viable (though costly) projectile for the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Hurricane is the premier special Flying-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. It is essential for "Rain Teams" (utilizing Pokémon like Pelipper or Zapdos) where its accuracy check is bypassed. It is also frequently seen on Max Move-focused sets (Max Airstream) in VGC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is intended for Pokémon with the physiological capacity for wind manipulation (typically Flying, Dragon, or certain Psychic/Ghost types).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily acquired via **Watt Traders** in the Galar Wild Area for a variable price in Watts. It can also be obtained as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** against Flying-type Pokémon (such as Corviknight or Braviary).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a piece of Galar-specific technology often gathered via Max Raid dens or by utilizing the **Pickup** ability at high levels (Level 91+ in specific Gen VIII contexts).
