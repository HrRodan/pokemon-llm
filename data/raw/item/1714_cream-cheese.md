* **Cost:** 280 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the Sandwich-making mini-game, Cream Cheese contributes to the sandwich's **Meal Powers**. It primarily provides a balance of Sweet and Salty flavors, which are essential for recipes targeting specific encounter types or bonuses.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect Utility).** While it has no direct combat application, it is used to activate Meal Powers such as *Catching Power*, *Exp. Point Power*, or *Raid Power*, which are vital for competitive team preparation and resource farming.
