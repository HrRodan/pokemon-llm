## Identity & Utility
**Linking Cord** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** A mysterious cord that exudes a strange energy, reminiscent of the physical link cables used in early handheld consoles. It is a **Consumable** item used from the bag to trigger evolutions that traditionally require a trade. While the data marks it as **Holdable**, it has no competitive function when held in battle.
* **Cost:** 8,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). In its debut region, it is often exchanged for Merit Points rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a specific species of Pokémon from the overworld menu, it triggers an immediate evolution. This mimics the "Trade" mechanic, allowing the Pokémon to evolve without being sent to another player. The item is consumed upon a successful evolution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with Fling in the games where it appears).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a utility item for Pokédex completion and team progression. It is a "Holy Grail" item for **Nuzlocke** challenges or solo-play runs where trading is restricted or impossible.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly triggers the evolution of the following Pokémon:
    * **Kadabra** into Alakazam
    * **Machoke** into Machamp
    * **Graveler** into Golem
    * **Haunter** into Gengar
    * **Rhydon** into Rhyperior (if used in conjunction with a Protector in certain iterations, though primarily targets base trade evolutions).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is available at the **Trading Post** in Jubilife Village for 1,000 Merit Points (MP). It can also be found as a rare drop within **Space-Time Distortions** or as a reward for specific Requests (Side Quests).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through specialized merchants or by finding "lost satchels" in the overworld.
* **Lore:** The Linking Cord is a meta-textual reference to the real-world **Game Boy Link Cable**. Its inclusion in the series was a major quality-of-life shift, acknowledging the difficulty of finding trade partners for certain evolution lines in a single-player-focused environment.
