## Identity & Utility
**Masterpiece Teacup** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IX (The Teal Mask DLC)**.
* **Description:** An ornate, antique teacup featuring a beautiful gold-colored pattern. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** specifically used to trigger the transformation of a specific form of Pokémon. In the game's economy, it is considered **Expensive** and rare, though it can be sold for a high price.
* **Cost:** 9,500 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Specialty Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag on an **Artisan Form Poltchageist**, it consumes the item to evolve the Pokémon into **Masterpiece Form Sinistcha**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard physical damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no utility in battle. However, it is essential for obtaining **Sinistcha**, a highly relevant Pokémon in the VGC (Double Battle) circuit due to its "Hospitality" ability and "Matcha Gotcha" signature move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly limited to the **Artisan Form** (the rare, "authentic" version identified by a mark on the bottom of the Pokémon). It will not work on the common Counterfeit Form Poltchageist, which requires the *Unremarkable Teacup* instead.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a static hidden item within the **Timeless Woods** in the land of Kitakami. It can also be obtained as a high-tier reward from the **Ogre Oustin'** mini-game. It is not typically available for purchase at standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Its acquisition is tied to exploration and mini-game completion, mirroring the rarity of the "Artisan" pottery it represents.
* **Lore Context:** The item's design and name are a reference to the Japanese art of *Kintsugi* (repairing broken pottery with gold) and the prestigious history of tea ceremonies. It serves as a mechanical gatekeeper for the rarest form of the Poltchageist line.
