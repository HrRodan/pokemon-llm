## Identity & Utility
**TM123 (Surf)** is a Technical Machine in the **all-machines** category, introduced in its current numerical designation during **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a data disc used to teach the move **Surf** to compatible Pokémon. While historically a Hidden Machine (HM), in the modern Paldea ecosystem, it functions as a consumable teaching tool. It is a **Consumable** item that is typically crafted rather than purchased with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; requires 10,000 LP and specific Pokémon materials—specifically Finizen Mucus and Wiglett Sand—at a TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Surf**, a highly reliable Special Water-type attack with **90 Base Power** and **100% Accuracy**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be Flung in the current generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Surf is a top-tier choice for Special Attackers requiring consistent Water-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). In **VGC (Doubles)**, it is a spread move that hits all adjacent targets, making it a cornerstone for "Rain" teams or strategies involving allies with the *Water Absorb* or *Storm Drain* abilities. In **Singles**, it is often preferred over Hydro Pump by players who value accuracy over high-variance power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, ranging from Water-types to various "bulky" Normal and Ice-types.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical item in the overworld of the **Paldea Region** (typically in aquatic environments or coastal cliffs) or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine after defeating specific Team Star bosses or advancing the main storyline.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or held items, TMs must be actively acquired through exploration or the TM Machine crafting system using materials gathered from wild **Finizen** and **Wiglett**.
