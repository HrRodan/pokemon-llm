## Identity & Utility
**Favored Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery designed for Trainers to compose and send messages to one another by attaching it to a Pokémon during a trade. It features a specific theme focused on the sender's "favorite things." It is a **Consumable/Communication** item that is generally available for purchase in its debut generations.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to write a message using a predetermined list of words and phrases. When held by a Pokémon, this message is delivered to the recipient upon trading. Once the message is read by the recipient, the Mail can be erased and reused or stored in the PC for record-keeping.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item **cannot be used** with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While primarily a social item, Mail has a niche technical application: **Item-Removal Immunity.** As long as a Pokémon is holding Mail, it **cannot be moved to the PC**, and more importantly, moves that remove or steal items (such as **Knock Off, Thief, Covet, Trick, or Switcheroo**) will automatically fail against the holder. This was historically used in specific niche strategies to prevent a Pokémon from losing its "held" status, though it offers no statistical buffs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Locking:** A Pokémon holding Favored Mail cannot be deposited into a PC box; the Mail must be removed first. 
    * **Sticky Hold Synergy:** It functions similarly to the Ability Sticky Hold in terms of item protection.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Pokémon Marts and specialized Stationery shops within the Unova and Kalos regions. It is typically found in the early-to-mid game due to its low price point.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or received from NPCs.
* **Legacy Note:** Mail mechanics were significantly scaled back in later generations (Gen VI onwards) and eventually removed from the series in favor of modern global communication features, making this a "legacy" item in the context of the modern Pokémon economy.
