## Identity & Utility
**Tough Candy XL** is a **Vitamin** (specifically an AV-booster) introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A large, specialized confection packed with energy. It is a **Consumable Medicine** used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's physical resilience. Unlike standard vitamins, this "XL" variant is restricted to high-level Pokémon (Lv. 60+).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the purchase price is low, its value is primarily derived from intensive farming rather than retail availability.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases the **Defense** stat of a Pokémon by increasing its **Awakened Values (AVs)**. In the *Let's Go* series mechanics, this allows a Pokémon to exceed the traditional stat limits found in other core-series games.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Item exists in a game engine where the move Fling is not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Post-game Optimization.** This item is exclusive to the *Let's Go* series and is not used in standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats. It is essential for "Master Trainer" challenges within its respective games to maximize a Pokémon's bulk.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no effect on evolution. It is strictly used for stat modification. It is limited to Pokémon that are **Level 60 or higher**, serving as the final tier of the Tough Candy hierarchy (Tough Candy > Tough Candy L > Tough Candy XL).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching Pokémon in the wild. Chaining catches of species that yield Defense candy (such as Geodude, Onix, or Shellder) increases the drop rate. It can also be obtained by transferring high-level Pokémon to **Professor Oak** or by walking with a Pokémon in the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is rewarded directly to the Trainer upon a successful capture or through specialized interactions. It is frequently farmed by late-game players to prepare for the game's toughest post-game encounters.
