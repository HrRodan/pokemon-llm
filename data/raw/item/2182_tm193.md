## Identity & Utility
**TM193 (Grassy Glide)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*).
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Grassy Glide**. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumables that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard Marts; requires **LP and Materials** for acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Grassy Glide** to a Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Grassy Glide is a **Grass-type Physical** move.
    * **Priority Mechanic:** Under normal conditions, it has a base power of 55. However, if the battlefield is under the effect of **Grassy Terrain**, this move gains **+1 Priority**, allowing the user to strike before most opponents.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be Flung in Gen IX mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier / Competitive Staple.** This TM is essential for physical Grass-type attackers, most notably **Rillaboom**. Despite a power reduction from 70 to 55 in Generation IX, its ability to provide priority damage makes it a cornerstone of "Terrain" teams in both VGC (Doubles) and Smogon (Singles) formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is heavily synergized with the Ability **Grassy Surge**, which automatically sets the terrain required for the move's priority effect.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM193 is primarily available in the **Terarium of Blueberry Academy** (*The Indigo Disk*). It is often obtained by defeating a specific number of trainers in the Canyon Biome or found as a static pickup in the overworld.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM at a TM Machine, players typically require:
    * **League Points (LP)**
    * **Bounsweet Sweat**
    * **Grookey Sweat**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured device. The "Sweat" materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Bounsweet** and **Grookey** lines via battle or the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature.
