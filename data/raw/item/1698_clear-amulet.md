## Identity & Utility
**Clear Amulet** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clear, protective amulet that shields the wearer from debilitating effects. It is a permanent, non-consumable held item that can be purchased at high-end specialty shops. 
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/Premium Tier).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The holder is protected from having its stats lowered by the moves or Abilities of other Pokémon. This includes immunity to stat-dropping moves (e.g., Leer, Fake Tears, Icy Wind) and pervasive Abilities such as **Intimidate**, **Cotton Down**, or **Gooey**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Top-Tier Competitive Staple**, specifically in VGC (Doubles). It is the premier counter-play to "Intimidate cycling," allowing physical attackers to maintain their offensive pressure. Unlike the Ability *Clear Body*, this effect is granted via an item slot, making it indispensable for physical sweepers who lack inherent stat-drop immunity.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Notably, it only prevents stat drops from **opponents**; it does not prevent self-inflicted stat reductions from moves like *Close Combat*, *Overheat*, or *Draco Meteor*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut region, it is primarily obtained through **Delibird Presents** shops (specifically in Mesagoza) after the player has earned a sufficient number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not currently found on wild Pokémon; it is strictly a retail or findable treasure item, reflecting its status as a sophisticated tool for advanced Pokémon training.
