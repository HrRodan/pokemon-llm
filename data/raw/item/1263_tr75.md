## Identity & Utility
**TR75 (Stone Edge)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Stone Edge** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in its debut generation, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic "disposable" machine mechanic.
* **Cost:** 16,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). It is typically acquired via Watt Traders in the Wild Area for 8,000 Watts rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Stone Edge**, a powerful Physical Rock-type attack. The move has a base power of 100, an accuracy of 80%, and an increased critical-hit ratio.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High damage). Using Fling with this item provides significant physical output but consumes the TR.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Stone Edge is the premier high-power Rock-type coverage move for physical attackers (such as Tyranitar, Machamp, or Terrakion). Despite its shaky accuracy, its high critical-hit rate and raw power make it a standard choice in Smogon and VGC formats to check Flying, Fire, Ice, and Bug-type threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-learning tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR75 is primarily obtained by defeating Rock-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area on a rotating daily stock.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The most reliable way to farm this item is through participation in high-density Max Raid dens (specifically those featuring Pokémon like Gigalith, Tyranitar, or Coalossal).
