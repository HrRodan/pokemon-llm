## Identity & Utility
**Boost-Mulch** is a **Mulch (Fertilizer)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer used in Berry farming to manipulate soil moisture levels. It is a **Consumable** item used specifically on soft soil patches. While highly effective in its native region, it is noted to be incompatible with the soil of the Hoenn region.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to a Berry plot, it causes the soil to dry out every **4 hours**. 
* **Mechanical Utility:** In Berry cultivation mechanics, watering a plant when the soil is dry is the primary method for increasing the final yield of Berries. By causing the soil to dry out rapidly (much faster than the standard rate), Boost-Mulch allows the player to water the plants more frequently, thereby maximizing the harvest of rare or yield-sensitive Berries.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a dedicated utility item for the "farming" sub-game within the overworld and has no impact on professional or ladder combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is primarily used in the Berry Fields (notably Route 7 in Kalos).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from specialized NPCs, such as the girl in the **Berry Fields** on Route 7 in the Kalos region. It can also be created using a **Mulch Maker** by composting various Berries.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this item is typically acquired through commerce or crafting.
* **Regional Constraint:** Despite being a Gen VI item, the flavor text explicitly states it has no effect in Hoenn (*Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire*), making it a region-locked mechanic for Kalos-based agriculture.
