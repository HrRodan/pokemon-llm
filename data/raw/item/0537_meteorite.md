## Identity & Utility
**Meteorite** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A lumpy, hard celestial object that fell from space. In the Kanto region, it is noted for landing on Mt. Moon. It serves as a non-consumable quest item that cannot be sold, held by Pokémon, or used in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Key Item / Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Meteorite functions as a trade/delivery object to progress specific NPC storylines:
    * **Hoenn (RSE):** Can be traded to **Professor Cozmo** in Fallarbor Town in exchange for **TM27 (Return)**.
    * **Kanto (FRLG):** Must be delivered to **Lostelle’s father** (the owner of the Joyful Game Corner) on Two Island as part of the Sevii Islands questline.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is strictly utility-based; obtaining **TM27 (Return)** is highly significant for physical attackers in Generation III, as it provides a consistent 102-power STAB move for many Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While this specific Generation III iteration is for trading/delivery, later regional variants of the Meteorite (World Knowledge) serve as the mechanism for changing **Deoxys** between its Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Formes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Hoenn:** Recovered from the machine at the peak of **Mt. Chimney** after defeating Team Magma/Aqua.
    * **Kanto:** Obtained from **Bill** at the start of the Sevii Islands sub-quest to be delivered to Two Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique story item typically gathered through scripted events or NPC interaction.
* **Lore Context:** The item bridges the gap between terrestrial geology and the extraterrestrial origins of certain Pokémon (like Clefairy or Deoxys), though its primary mechanical role in its debut generation is facilitating the acquisition of powerful Technical Machines.
