## Identity & Utility
**Zapdos Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies (like Quick Candy or Tough Candy) which boost a single stat, this item is tailored specifically to the Zapdos evolutionary line (including its regional variants in compatible titles). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be traditionally purchased in Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily used for selling excess stock rather than purchasing).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Zapdos**, it increases all of its stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. This utilizes the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series, rather than the traditional Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche / Format-Specific.** It is a mandatory item for players looking to "max out" a Zapdos for the *Let's Go* competitive meta. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats (Generations VIII-IX), as those games reverted to the standard EV training system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a performance enhancer. While the JSON does not list attributes, world knowledge dictates it is **non-transferable** to games outside the *Let's Go* engine for use.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily by **transferring Zapdos** to Professor Oak or by catching wild Zapdos (which appear as rare spawns in the sky after the player has defeated the Elite Four). It can also be obtained by walking a Zapdos in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is a reward for capture or management mechanics rather than a farmable held item.
* **Context:** In the *Let's Go* ecosystem, species-specific candies are the most efficient way to reach the 200 AV cap in every stat, making them significantly more powerful than standard "Size" candies (S, M, L).
