## Identity & Utility
**Ampharosite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed for a specific evolutionary line. When held by an Ampharos, it triggers a Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer possesses a Mega Ring or Mega Bracelet. It is a **Non-consumable Held Item** that **cannot be purchased** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through exploration or as a special gift).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by an **Ampharos**, it allows the Pokémon to transform into **Mega Ampharos** once per battle. This transformation significantly increases its Special Attack, Defense, and Special Defense stats while slightly reducing its Speed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Base power dealt if used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Tactical.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Gen 6, 7, and National Dex), Ampharosite is essential for utilizing Mega Ampharos. It transforms the user into a bulky **Electric/Dragon** type and grants the **Mold Breaker** ability, allowing it to bypass defensive abilities like *Volt Absorb*, *Sturdy*, or *Levitate*. However, it requires significant team support due to its low Speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to Ampharos. It does not trigger permanent evolution and cannot be used by Flaaffy or Mareep. It cannot be knocked off or stolen via moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by the correct Pokémon during battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a unique "hidden" item or gifted by specific NPCs. In its debut (Pokémon X & Y), it is obtained from a man on an island in **Azure Bay**. In later generations like Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon, it is often obtained via the **Battle Tree** for 64 Battle Points (BP).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that must be located by the player or earned through high-level battle facilities.
