## Identity & Utility
**Spice Mix** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A complex culinary blend containing over fifty distinct spices. It is a **Consumable** ingredient used exclusively within the **Pokémon Camp** cooking mechanic to create various types of Curry. It cannot be used during battle or directly on a Pokémon in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as the key ingredient in the Curry Dex, it produces the **Spice-Mix Curry** family. Depending on the berries added alongside it, the resulting dish will typically have a **Spicy** flavor profile. 
* **Cooking Results:** Successful cooking restores a Pokémon's HP and PP, provides an Experience Point boost, and increases sociability/affection levels.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the "Curry Dex" completion and out-of-battle party maintenance. It provides no tactical advantage in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any specific abilities beyond being a valid target for the move *Fling*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased from **Ingredients Sellers** found in the Galar region’s **Wild Area** (specifically at the Rolling Fields and Hammerlocke Hills). Its availability in the shop rotation is random.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is occasionally found as a "hidden item" (sparkle on the ground) in various Wild Area biomes, where it is often gathered by players exploring the Galar region.
* **Lore context:** The description emphasizes its complexity ("over fifty spices"), marking it as one of the more refined "basic" ingredients available to trainers for high-quality camp cooking.
