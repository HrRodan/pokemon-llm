## Identity & Utility
**Growlithe Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically to the Growlithe evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought and sold, though it is primarily earned through gameplay actions.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Growlithe** or **Arcanine**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by +1. This contributes to the **Awakening Values (AVs)** system unique to the Kanto remakes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in generations where Fling is a usable mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is vital for "No-Restrictions" competitive play within the *Let's Go* series, where AV-boosted stats are permitted. It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats from Generation VIII onwards, as the AV system was replaced by the traditional EV system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly boosts the effectiveness of Growlithe and Arcanine. It is highly efficient compared to generic stat candies (like Health Candy or Tough Candy) because it upgrades every stat at once without the need for size-tier variants (L or XL).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the *Let's Go* titles by catching wild Growlithe. High **Catch Combos** of Growlithe significantly increase the drop rate of these candies. They are also awarded by **Professor Oak** when transferring Growlithe from the Pokémon Box to his lab.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item in the wild. It is gathered through the **Catching/Transferring mechanic** rather than the Pickup ability or Thief/Covet.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Alola-era engine used for the Kanto remakes, these candies represent a simplified, species-focused training method, allowing a trainer to maximize a Pokémon's potential (up to +200 in every stat) far beyond traditional level-up caps.
