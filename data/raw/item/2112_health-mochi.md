## Identity & Utility
**Health Mochi** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Teal Mask* DLC).
* **Description:** A nutritious snack originating from the Kitakami region. It functions as a specialized supplement that improves a Pokémon's base HP. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily obtained through gameplay rewards rather than traditional Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 125 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically earned as a reward rather than purchased in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a Pokémon's **HP Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. It can be used until the Pokémon reaches the maximum cap of 252 HP EVs. Unlike vitamins in early generations, there is no "floor" or "ceiling" for its usage until the stat is maxed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard for medicine and vitamin-style items).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** In the competitive circuit (VGC and Smogon), Health Mochi is an essential tool for "EV Training." It allows players to precisely calibrate a Pokémon's bulk and survivability without the need for repetitive wild Pokémon grinding.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a direct alternative to the **HP Up**, providing the exact same EV boost but categorized under the Mochi sub-group.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available as a reward for participating in the **Ogre Oustin'** minigame at Kitakami Hall. The amount and quality of Mochi received depend on the difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard) and the player's performance.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a regional specialty of Kitakami and is often gathered in large quantities by players looking to optimize their competitive rosters.
* **Lore Context:** Introduced as part of the Festival of Masks, Mochi represents the local culture of the Kitakami region and serves as a thematic counterpart to the traditional medicinal Vitamins found in the core Paldea region.
