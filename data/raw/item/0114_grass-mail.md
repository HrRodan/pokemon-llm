## Identity & Utility
**Grass-Mail** is an **All-Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV** (notably appearing in the Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** This item is a piece of stationery featuring a print of a refreshingly green field. It is a **Held Item** used primarily for social interaction; a Trainer can compose a message using a predetermined word bank and give it to a Pokémon to carry. While held, the Pokémon cannot be placed into the PC storage system, ensuring the message is delivered during a trade. It is a **reusable** item if the message is erased after being read.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates communication between players. When given to a Pokémon, the player selects words to form a message. This message is then viewable by the recipient of the Pokémon via trade.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Utility.** In older generations, Mail items had a unique mechanical property: they **cannot be removed or stolen** in battle. Moves like *Thief*, *Covet*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo* will fail against a Pokémon holding Grass-Mail. This occasionally saw niche use to "Trick-proof" a Pokémon, though it comes at the high opportunity cost of not being able to hold a stat-boosting item or Leftovers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Holding Grass-Mail prevents the Pokémon from being deposited into the PC. It must be moved to the Bag (and the message deleted or archived) before the Pokémon can be stored. It does not trigger any evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Sinnoh region and other compatible regions. It is one of the most affordable items in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through direct purchase from retailers or found as overworld loot in urban areas.
* **Lore context:** Before the advent of modern Global Trade Stations and integrated messaging systems, Mail like the Grass-Mail was the primary way for Trainers to add a personal touch or specific instructions to a Pokémon being sent to a friend.
