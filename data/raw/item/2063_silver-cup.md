## Identity & Utility
**Silver Cup** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A decorative tableware item used specifically during the Picnic mechanic. It serves as a cosmetic customization option, replacing the default cups on the picnic table with a polished silver variant. It is a **Consumable/Permanent Cosmetic** item that can be purchased at specialized retailers.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Compared to standard picnic gear, this is a premium luxury item aimed at late-game trainers or collectors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When a Picnic is started, if the Silver Cup is selected in the "Picnic Gear" menu, the visual appearance of the cups used by the trainer and their Pokémon changes to a silver finish. This effect is purely aesthetic and provides no functional bonuses to Sandwich-making or Meal Powers.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a cosmetic overworld item with no impact on VGC, Smogon, or any competitive battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities (such as Pickup or Klutz). It is strictly a player-character customization tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at **Picnic-Knacks** stores located in major Paldean cities, specifically **Cascarrafa, Levincia, and Mesagoza**. It is usually available from the start of the game, provided the player has the necessary funds.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made commodity found exclusively in retail shops.
* **Context:** In the Paldea region, picnicking is a central social and mechanical feature. The Silver Cup represents a "luxury tier" of picnic equipment, often collected by completionists looking to fully customize their outdoor aesthetic alongside rare Tablecloths and Water Bottles.
