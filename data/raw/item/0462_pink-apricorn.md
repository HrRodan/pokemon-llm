## Identity & Utility
**Pink Apricorn** is a specialized **Crafting Ingredient** (categorized under Apricorn-box) introduced in Generation II and revitalized in Generation IV.
* **Description:** A pink, sweet-smelling fruit harvested from Apricorn trees. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that acts as a raw material for specialized Poké Ball production. While it has a technical cost associated with it, it is primarily obtained through overworld harvesting rather than traditional Mart purchases.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When given to the artisan **Kurt in Azalea Town**, it is processed over a 24-hour period into a **Love Ball**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. The item itself cannot be used in battle. Its value is entirely "Pre-Battle" utility for the creation of Love Balls, which are highly sought after in the **"Aprimon"** trading community for their rarity and unique pink heart animation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with Kurt's smithing mechanic. In some generations (like Gen VII/VIII), Apricorns can be used in the **Cram-o-matic** to potentially yield Rare Poké Balls.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in the **Johto region**. It is harvested from daily-respawning Apricorn trees located on **Route 30, Route 33, and Route 42**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In games like *HeartGold and SoulSilver*, players must use the **Apricorn Box** to store these items, as they are distinct from standard inventory medicine or berries.
* **Lore Context:** Apricorns represent the ancient way Poké Balls were constructed before the industrialization of the Silph Co. and Devon Corp models. The Pink Apricorn specifically results in a ball that is more effective when catching Pokémon of the opposite gender to the player's active Pokémon (if they are the same species).
