## Identity & Utility
**Golden Pinap Berry** is a **Catching-Bonus Berry** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A high-tier consumable berry specifically designed for the capture phase of an encounter. When fed to a wild Pokémon, it drastically increases the chance of receiving bonus items (such as Pokémon-specific Candies or additional Berries) upon a successful catch. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased, though it is often treated as a premium resource.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a wild encounter encounter, it provides a "drastic" multiplier to the item drop rate. In the context of the *Let's Go* series, this maximizes the yield of Candies used for stat-awakening (AVs) and rare item rewards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal impact; using this item in a standard battle is inefficient).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is mechanically locked to the capture interface and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles. It is strictly a "Catching Mechanic" tool for progression and optimization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. However, it is the direct upgrade to the standard **Pinap Berry** and the **Silver Pinap Berry**, representing the highest tier of the "Pinap" family of consumables.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon: Let's Go*, these are rarely sold in late-game Poké Marts but are most commonly farmed as hidden recurring items within the **Cerulean Cave**. They are also occasionally rewarded for high-level gameplay in *Pokémon GO* (which connects to the Gen VII Let's Go games).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. They are typically gathered through environmental interaction or "hidden item" respawn points in high-level endgame areas. Unlike standard Berries, they cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability in most core-series games.
