## Identity & Utility
**Smoked Fillet** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A processed food item characterized by its distinct smoky aroma. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** specifically designed for the Picnic mechanic. It cannot be held by Pokémon for use in battle and is utilized exclusively for crafting sandwiches to gain temporary buffs.
* **Cost:** 330 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as an ingredient in a sandwich during a Picnic, it contributes to the resulting **Meal Powers**. It provides specific flavor profiles (salty and savory) that influence the levels of Encounter Power, Catching Power, or Sparkling Power for various Pokémon types.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Direct) / High (Indirect).** While useless in a technical battle, it is an essential resource for "Pre-Competitive" preparation, such as using Encounter Power to find specific Tera-type candidates or Sparkling Power for Shiny hunting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities like Pickup or Klutz. Its utility is strictly limited to the Paldean culinary system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased primarily from specialized food vendors in the Paldea region, specifically **Deli Cioso** branches and **Aquiesta Supermarket**. Availability usually unlocks after the player has obtained a specific number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or natural ingredients, Smoked Fillets are processed goods that must be purchased or found as rare overworld sparkles in picnic-heavy areas.
