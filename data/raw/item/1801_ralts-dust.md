## Identity & Utility
**Ralts Dust** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fine dust left behind by members of the Ralts evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or, more importantly, exchanged at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it has a low sell price, its primary value lies in its use as a crafting reagent rather than direct commerce.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a specific ingredient at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is required to craft various TMs to teach moves to Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None directly. However, it is essential for the **competitive preparation phase**, as it is required to craft high-impact moves such as **TM054 (Psyshock)**, **TM092 (Imprison)**, and **TM120 (Psychic)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a purely mechanical resource tied to the Gen IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the **Paldea region** (and subsequent DLC areas). It is earned automatically after defeating or catching wild members of the Ralts family.
* **Wild Sources:** Dropped by wild **Ralts**, **Kirlia**, **Gardevoir**, and **Gallade**. 
* **Farming Context:** Players typically farm this item in areas where Ralts are common (such as South Province Area One) to mass-produce powerful Psychic-type TMs. It is a common drop, fitting its low cost and high utility in the early-to-mid game.
