## Identity & Utility
**Pineapple** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** A culinary ingredient used exclusively within the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable food item that is readily available for purchase at specialized grocery vendors. As an ingredient, it provides specific flavor profiles (primarily Sweet and Sour) that influence the resulting Meal Powers.
* **Cost:** 250 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich recipe, Pineapple contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. It typically boosts **Item Drop Power**, **Exp. Point Power**, and **Teensy Power**. It is frequently associated with **Water**, **Ground**, and **Psychic** type influences depending on the other ingredients present.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists strictly for the out-of-battle Picnic mechanic to provide utility buffs (such as increasing Shiny encounter rates or Egg discovery speed).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the **Sandwich Making** mini-game; its physical shape (circular slices) makes it a "stackable" but potentially unstable ingredient that can slide off the bread if not placed carefully.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at food supply outlets across the Paldea region, specifically **Sure Cans**, **Aguas Fresh**, and **Every Wich Way** kiosks. It is unlocked for purchase early in the journey.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which can be farmed in the wild, Pineapple must be purchased from retail vendors or occasionally received as a reward from NPCs at picnic spots.
