## Identity & Utility
**Ultranecrozium Z** is a **Z-Crystal (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** This specialized crystal is a unique catalyst designed specifically for the Legendary Pokémon Necrozma. Unlike standard Z-Crystals that simply power up moves, this item facilitates a process known as **Ultra Burst**, allowing Necrozma to achieve its true form. It is a **Special Acquisition** item that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item/Unique Held Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect (Ultra Burst):** When held by **Dusk Mane Necrozma** (fused with Solgaleo) or **Dawn Wings Necrozma** (fused with Lunala), it enables the "Ultra Burst" command in battle. This transforms the Pokémon into **Ultra Necrozma**, significantly boosting its stats and changing its type to Psychic/Dragon.
* **Secondary Effect (Z-Move):** Once transformed into Ultra Necrozma, if the Pokémon knows the move **Photon Geyser**, the Ultranecrozium Z allows it to upgrade that move into the signature Z-Move: **Light That Burns the Sky**. This move deals massive damage based on the higher of the user's Attack or Sp. Atk and ignores the target's Ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple (Ubers).** In formats where it is permitted, Ultra Necrozma is a dominant offensive force. The item is mandatory for accessing one of the highest base stat totals in the game (754).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is strictly tied to Necrozma's fusion forms. It does not evolve the Pokémon permanently but acts as a temporary in-battle transformation similar to Mega Evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained during the climactic story events involving the Ultra Recon Squad and the battle at the **Megalo Tower** in Ultra Megalopolis.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item tied to the game's narrative and the "Blinding One" prophecy of the Alola region.
* **Context:** The "Bag" suffix in the data refers to the item's presence in the player's inventory, which triggers its availability as a held item for the specific eligible Pokémon. It represents the ultimate power of Light in the Alolan mythos.
