## Identity & Utility
**Impidimp Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This item is a tuft of hair shed by an Impidimp. In the context of modern Pokémon mechanics, it functions as a specialized crafting component used at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold but not bought directly from standard shops.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Low Value**; primarily used for its utility in crafting rather than as a source of income).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). It has no direct effect when used on a Pokémon or held in battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard for most Gen IX materials, it cannot be used with the move Fling for any significant effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is a byproduct of the Impidimp evolutionary line (Impidimp, Morgrem, and Grimmsnarl). It is essential for players looking to teach high-tier Dark or Fairy-type moves to their team via the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Impidimp**, **Morgrem**, or **Grimmsnarl**. These Pokémon are typically found in the **Tagtree Thicket** region of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is awarded automatically to the player's inventory upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Impidimp line. It cannot be gathered via the Pickup ability in its debut generation.
* **Crafting Context:** It is commonly required for TMs such as **TM094 (Dark Pulse)** and **TM079 (Dazzling Gleam)**, reflecting the Dark/Fairy typing of the source Pokémon.
