## Identity & Utility
**Litleo Tuft** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item is a tuft of fur shed by a Litleo. It serves as a specialized crafting component used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon from the bag.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**). While it can be sold, its primary economic value is as a crafting resource or for conversion into League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Acts as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Players must combine Litleo Tufts with League Points (LP) and other Pokémon materials to generate permanent move-teaching items. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles. Its importance is strictly logistical, enabling the acquisition of competitive moves for a team's moveset.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Generation IX crafting loop and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional held-item capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the **Paldea region**. It is not sold at Poké Marts or Delibird Presents.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. Instead, it is a guaranteed drop (often in quantities of 1 to 3) awarded after defeating or catching wild **Litleo** or its evolution, **Pyroar**. It is most efficiently farmed in areas like South Province (Area Three) and East Province (Area One) where Litleo are common.
