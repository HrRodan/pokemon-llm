## Identity & Utility
**Quick Powder** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An extremely fine, hard, and mysterious powder specifically designed for use by Ditto. It is a **Held Item** that can be sold for a moderate price but is primarily obtained through exploration or farming wild encounters.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Ditto**, it doubles the holder’s base Speed stat. However, this Speed boost is strictly limited to Ditto's untransformed state; the effect is immediately lost once Ditto uses the move **Transform** or if it has the Ability **Imposter**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Low Utility.** In competitive play, Ditto is almost exclusively used with the Ability *Imposter* and a *Choice Scarf*. Since Quick Powder's boost vanishes upon transformation, it fails to provide the "Speed tie-breaker" that Choice Scarf offers against an opponent's transformed copy. Its only viable use is to ensure a manual move "Transform" executes before the opponent attacks in the first turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no effect on evolution. It is one of two signature items for Ditto, the other being the **Metal Powder** (which boosts Defense/Special Defense).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in locations where Ditto congregate, such as the Giant Chasm (Unova) or via the Poké Radar. In many games, it is not available for purchase in standard Poké Marts and must be found in the overworld.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently found on wild **Ditto** (50% chance in some generations). It is often gathered by players using the **Thief** or **Covet** moves, or via the **Pickup** ability if the Pokémon is within the correct level bracket.
