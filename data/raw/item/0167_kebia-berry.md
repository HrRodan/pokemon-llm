## Identity & Utility
**Kebia Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A defensive berry designed to mitigate incoming damage from specific elemental weaknesses. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically purchasable but more commonly obtained through foraging or farming. 
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a **super-effective Poison-type move**, the Kebia Berry is consumed to reduce the damage of that single hit by **50%**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; consumes the berry to hit the target).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Poison-type** attack with **80 Base Power** (Gen VI+) or 60 Base Power (Gen IV-V).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche. While Poison-type moves became more prevalent after the introduction of Fairy-types (e.g., Sludge Bomb, Gunk Shot), the Kebia Berry is rarely used compared to Shuca (Ground) or Yache (Ice) Berries. It is most effective on Fairy or Grass-type Pokémon that need to survive a 4x weakness or a heavy Poison-type coverage move.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with abilities like **Ripen** (doubles the damage reduction to 75%) and **Unburden** (doubles Speed upon consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found on Berry Trees or via specific NPCs in the Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos regions. In later generations, it is often acquired through the Berry Pharmacy or wild encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is occasionally found being held by wild **Shroomish** and **Breloom**. These can be efficiently farmed using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or gathered via the **Pickup** ability in certain level brackets.
