## Identity & Utility
**Level Ball** is an **Apricorn Ball** introduced in Generation II (Johto) and formally indexed in later data sets under Generation IV.
* **Description:** A specialized Poké Ball designed for capturing Pokémon significantly weaker than the trainer's active Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Its value lies in its rarity and specific crafting method rather than retail price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Level Ball applies a catch rate multiplier based on the level difference between the player's active Pokémon and the wild target:
    * **8× Multiplier:** If the player's Pokémon level is more than four times the wild Pokémon’s level (e.g., Level 80 vs Level 19).
    * **4× Multiplier:** If the player's Pokémon level is more than double the wild Pokémon’s level (e.g., Level 40 vs Level 19).
    * **2× Multiplier:** If the player's Pokémon level is higher than the wild Pokémon's, but less than double.
    * **1× Multiplier:** If the player's Pokémon is the same level or lower than the wild target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Poké Balls cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used for **aesthetic coordination**. In competitive VGC and Smogon circles, players often use Level Balls to match Pokémon with red, yellow, or black color schemes (like Arcanine or Groudon) to signify rarity and "Ball Swagger."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time use item; if the capture fails, the ball is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally handcrafted by the NPC **Kurt** in Azalea Town (Johto) using a **Red Apricorn**. In more recent titles (like Sword/Shield or Scarlet/Violet), it is obtained as a rare reward from the "Ball Guy," the Ace Academy Tournament, or the Porto Marinada auctions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly an artisan item or a rare event reward, making it one of the most difficult Poké Balls to mass-produce.
* **World Knowledge:** The Level Ball is the most effective ball in the game for catching low-level Pokémon in "early-route" areas during the post-game, outperforming even the Ultra Ball (2×) and Dusk Ball (3×) when the level gap is sufficiently wide.
