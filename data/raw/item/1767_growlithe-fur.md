## Identity & Utility
**Growlithe Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A clump of soft, warm fur shed or dropped by the Growlithe evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various TMs. It cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Value-based for exchange into League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft high-utility Fire-type and support Technical Machines. Players combine these materials with League Points (LP) at Pokémon Centers to "print" TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and its expansions. It has no tactical value in VGC, Smogon, or in-game battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency/component for the **TM Machine** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the **Paldea** region, **Kitakami**, and the **Terarium** (Blueberry Academy). It is obtained by defeating or catching wild **Growlithe** or **Arcanine** (including their Hisuian forms).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but rather a **guaranteed drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is most efficiently farmed using the **"Let's Go!" auto-battle feature**, where a Pokémon can quickly clear groups of wild Growlithe to accumulate large quantities of fur.
* **Crafting Context:** In Generation IX, Growlithe Fur is commonly required for crafting iconic moves such as **TM165 (Flare Blitz)**, **TM130 (Helping Hand)**, and **TM118 (Heat Wave)**, reflecting the Pokémon's identity as a loyal, fiery companion.
