## Identity & Utility
**Charti Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A consumable held item that triggers automatically when the holder is struck by a super-effective Rock-type move. As part of the specialized damage-reduction berry cycle, it is a defensive tool used to survive high-impact coverage moves.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily acquired through cultivation or foraging rather than direct purchase in most regions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is targeted by a super-effective Rock-type attack, the Charti Berry is consumed to reduce the damage taken by 50% (halved).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally inefficient for Fling strategies).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Rock-type** attack with **80 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Niche Defensive Staple**. It is most effectively utilized by Pokémon with a 4x weakness to Rock—such as **Volcarona (Bug/Fire)**, **Charizard (Fire/Flying)**, or **Talonflame (Fire/Flying)**—allowing them to survive a "Stone Edge" or "Rock Slide" that would otherwise result in an OHKO (One-Shot Knockout). In VGC (Doubles), it can be used to bait and survive Rock-type spread damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Consumed upon use; interacts with the ability **Ripen** (doubles the damage reduction to 75%) and **Unnerve** (prevents the opponent from eating the berry).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in berry plots, granted by the Berry Master, or found in the overworld in regions like Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Taillow** and **Swellow** (5% chance). These can be efficiently farmed using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** or **Covet**.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of berries, the Charti Berry belongs to the "Super-Effective Reduction" group, alongside others like the Occa (Fire) and Yache (Ice) berries, which are essential for neutralizing an opponent's type advantage.
