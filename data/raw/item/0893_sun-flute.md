## Identity & Utility
**Sun Flute** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** An ancient, ornate flute said to produce tones that express gratitude toward the Legendary Pokémon of the sun. It is a **Key Item** and a critical story element; it cannot be held by Pokémon in battle, traded, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When played in harmony with the Moon Flute at the Altar of the Sunne (or Altar of the Moone), it summons the Legendary Pokémon of Alola. Its primary mechanical purpose is to evolve **Cosmoem (Nebby)** into **Solgaleo** (specifically in the context of the Alolan narrative).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for plot progression and overworld events. It has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Acts as the essential catalyst for the evolution of the Cosmog line. It is used in a scripted event rather than as a standard "Evolution Stone" from the bag menu.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Pokémon Sun** and **Ultra Sun**, the player obtains it at **Exultation Hill** on Poni Island.
    * In **Pokémon Moon** and **Ultra Moon**, the player receives it from **Lillie** at the Ancient Poni Path.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. As a unique story-bound object, it cannot be found on wild Pokémon or retrieved via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** The Sun Flute is the solar counterpart to the Moon Flute. According to Alolan legend, the two flutes must be played together by two individuals to call upon the power of the Sunne or Moone Pokémon to open an Ultra Wormhole.
