## Identity & Utility
**Tomato** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fresh, sliced vegetable used specifically in the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a consumable ingredient that can be purchased in bulk for culinary use. Unlike traditional held items, it is stored in the Ingredients pocket of the bag.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a component in Sandwich making. When added to a sandwich, it contributes to the resulting **Meal Powers**. Specifically, Tomato provides a boost to **Salty** and **Sour** flavor profiles. 
* **Meal Power Influence:** In the sandwich system, Tomato is a key ingredient for recipes targeting:
    * **Catching Power:** Increases the likelihood of successful captures.
    * **Exp. Point Power:** Increases experience gained in battle.
    * **Encounter Power:** Increases the spawn rate of specific types (often associated with Fairy-type recipes when combined with specific condiments).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients generally cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is entirely restricted to out-of-battle preparation and the "Meal Power" buff system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at food-specific retail outlets throughout the **Paldea region**, such as **Sure Cans**, **Aguirre's Deli**, and **Every Wich Way**. It is unlocked for purchase early in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through urban commerce and exploration of the Paldean culinary scene.
