## Identity & Utility
**Style Card** is a **Key Item** (categorized under Gameplay) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized membership card that expands the available inventory at fashion boutiques and the variety of options at hair salons. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, traded, or sold. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon acquisition, the player automatically gains access to a wider array of clothing items, accessories, and hairstyles. This serves as a cosmetic unlock for player customization throughout the Galar region.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on battle mechanics, stats, or strategy; its utility is strictly limited to aesthetic overworld customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz, as it remains in the "Key Items" pocket of the Trainer's bag.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically associated with the **Isle of Armor** expansion. It is obtained as a gift from **Honey** at the Master Dojo shortly after the player arrives and begins their trials.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time acquisition provided by an NPC to mark progress within the DLC storyline.
* **Context:** In the Galar region's culture, which places heavy emphasis on fashion and public image, the Style Card represents an "all-access" pass to high-end trends that were previously restricted to elite trainers or long-term residents.
