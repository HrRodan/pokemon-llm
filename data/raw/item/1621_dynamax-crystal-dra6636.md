## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA6636)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It causes a specific Pokémon (referenced by the internal code DRA6636) to appear as a Dynamax encounter regardless of weather or standard den rotations. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot** be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Promotional**; though a value exists in the data, it is not sold in Poke Marts and is distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific stone den in the Galar Wild Area), it activates a Max Raid Battle. The encounter persists until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is strictly for overworld encounter generation. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess high Individual Values (IVs) and potentially Hidden Abilities, making it a source for competitive breeding stock.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (DRA6636) was historically associated with version-exclusive promotional distributions, such as the encounter for **Jangmo-o**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **Pre-order Bonus** or via **Retail Serial Codes** (e.g., from retailers like Amazon or Pokémon Center) for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. It is not obtainable through natural exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to bridge version-exclusive gaps or provide early access to specific evolutionary lines.
* **Nuzlocke Context:** In "hardcore" Nuzlocke rules, this is often treated as a "gift encounter" or a static encounter, providing a guaranteed high-tier Dragon-type (if Jangmo-o) to the player's roster.
