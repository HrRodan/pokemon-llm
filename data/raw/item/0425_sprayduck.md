## Identity & Utility
**Sprayduck** is a **Key Item (Gameplay Utility)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A watering can whimsically shaped like a Psyduck. It is used to hydrate Berry plants growing in soft soil to ensure healthy growth and maximize crop yields. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; given as a gift by an NPC).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in the overworld in front of a Berry patch, it waters the soil. This prevents the soil from drying out, which is necessary for the plant to progress through its growth stages and directly correlates to the number of Berries harvested upon maturity.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no combat application. Its utility is strictly restricted to the overworld economy and resource management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is the primary tool for farming Berries (such as Lum, Sitrus, or Enigma Berries) which are vital for competitive held-item strategies and natural medicine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum*, and their remakes (*Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl*), it is obtained at the **Flower Shop in Floaroma Town**. It is given to the player by a woman inside the shop early in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique tool specifically designed for the Sinnoh region's agricultural mechanics, serving as the regional successor to the Hoenn region's Wailmer Pail and the Johto region's SquirtBottle.
