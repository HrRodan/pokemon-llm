## Identity & Utility
**TM89** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a compatible Pokémon a specific move. Historically, TM89 is the designated machine for **U-turn**, a Bug-type physical attack. As a Technical Machine, its usage mechanics vary by generation: it was a single-use consumable in early generations, became infinite-use in Generation V through VIII, and returned to a craftable/consumable format in Generation IX.
* **Cost:** 20,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). This high price point reflects its status as one of the most strategically valuable moves in the game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **U-turn** to a compatible Pokémon. U-turn deals damage and immediately switches the user out for another Pokémon in the party, provided there is a teammate available to switch in.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically have a Fling power of 10, though they are rarely used for this purpose).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite/Staple.** U-turn is a cornerstone of competitive play (Smogon and VGC). It provides "momentum," allowing a player to damage an opponent and switch to a counter-pick safely based on the opponent's move or switch. It is essential for "Pivot" roles and Scouting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a massive variety of Pokémon, ranging from Bug-types and Flying-types to many fast Physical Attackers (e.g., Infernape, Scizor, Landorus-Therian).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game Department Stores (like Veilstone or Celadon) or as a reward for high-level challenges (like the Battle Frontier/Battle Tree). In *Scarlet & Violet*, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through exploration, TM crafting, or high-tier Poké Marts.
* **Contextual Note:** While the flavor text in certain database versions may erroneously display terrain-related descriptions, TM89's identity is defined globally in the series as the teaching tool for the move **U-turn**.
