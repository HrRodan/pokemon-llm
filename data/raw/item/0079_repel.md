## Identity & Utility
**Repel** is a **Spelunking/Exploration** item introduced in Generation I (referenced here in its Generation IV iteration).
* **Description:** An aerosol spray used in the overworld to ward off wild Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that is widely available for purchase at Poke Marts. It serves as the entry-level tier of the encounter-management hierarchy, followed by Super Repel and Max Repel.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag, it prevents wild Pokémon encounters for **100 steps**. This effect only applies to wild Pokémon whose level is lower than the level of the Pokémon currently in the first slot of the player's party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the **overworld/story mode**. It is a staple in **Speedrunning** and **Nuzlocke** challenges to navigate "trash" encounters in caves and tall grass quickly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. The mechanic relies entirely on the **Level of the lead Pokémon**; if the lead Pokémon is fainted but still in the first slot, its level is still used for the calculation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available at almost all Poké Marts and Department Stores once the player has obtained their first Badge. It is typically the first encounter-deterrent available to trainers.
* **Efficiency Note:** While the Repel is cheap, it is mathematically the least cost-effective of the series (4 Poké Dollars per step) compared to the Super Repel, which provides better value.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; it is a man-made utility item intended for human trainers to traverse dangerous habitats like Mt. Coronet or the Kanto Power Plant safely.
