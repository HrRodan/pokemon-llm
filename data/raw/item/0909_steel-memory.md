## Identity & Utility
**Steel Memory** is a **Memories** item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized electronic memory disc containing high-density Steel-type data. It is a **Competitive Held Item** designed specifically for a single evolutionary line. While it has a listed cost, it functions as a specialized form-change tool rather than a standard consumable.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though typically acquired as a special gift rather than purchased in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the item triggers the **RKS System** ability, changing Silvally’s base type to **Steel**. Additionally, it changes the type of Silvally’s signature move, **Multi-Attack**, to Steel.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Steel is widely considered the best defensive typing in the game. In lower-tier competitive formats (such as Smogon PU/NU), the Steel Memory is a popular choice for Silvally, providing it with crucial resistances to Stealth Rock, Fairy, and Dragon-type moves, as well as an immunity to Toxic. It allows Silvally to function as a durable pivot or a Swords Dance sweeper with a high-base-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move in Multi-Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is useless if held by any Pokémon other than Silvally. It serves as a technological analog to Arceus's Iron Plate.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as part of a set of 17 Memories. In its debut (Sun/Moon/USUM), it is gifted to the player by **Gladion** at the Aether House or Ancient Poni Path. In Generation VIII, it is obtained from an NPC in the Battle Tower after obtaining Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a man-made object created by the Aether Foundation to weaponize "Type: Null" as a "Beast Killer," mimicking the power of the Alpha Pokémon, Arceus.
* **Nuzlocke Note:** In a Nuzlocke run, this item is a high-value asset, as Steel's numerous resistances significantly increase Silvally's survivability in major boss fights.
