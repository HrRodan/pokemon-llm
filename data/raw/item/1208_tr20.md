## Identity & Utility
**TR20 (Substitute)** is a **Technical Record** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use teaching device used to grant a Pokémon the move **Substitute**. The move allows the user to sacrifice 25% of its maximum HP to create a decoy that protects it from status conditions and direct damage. Unlike TMs in its debut generation, this TR is **consumable** and disappears after one use.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Premium). While it has a standard currency value, it is primarily exchanged for Watts in its home region.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Substitute** to a compatible Pokémon. Substitute is a strategic Normal-type status move that creates a "doll" with HP equal to the amount sacrificed; this doll absorbs hits until its HP reaches zero.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Essential.** Substitute is a cornerstone of competitive play across all formats (VGC and Smogon). It is used to dodge "Toxic" or "Will-O-Wisp," scout opponent moves, and provide a buffer for setup sweepers (e.g., "Sub-Seed" Serperior or "Sub-SD" Zacian).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR20 is primarily obtained by defeating Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** (specifically Normal-type dens) or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a fluctuating price in Watts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically a reward for high-level Raid encounters, reflecting the high tactical value of the move it teaches.
