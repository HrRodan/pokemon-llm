## Identity & Utility
**TM13 (Technical Machine 13)** is an item in the **All-Machines** category introduced in **Generation I** (though categorized in this data under its Generation III/Hoenn technical iteration).
* **Description:** A device used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike early generations where TMs were single-use, modern iterations (from Gen V to Gen VII and Gen IX) allow for multiple uses or crafting. This specific TM has historically been the primary method for teaching the high-tier move **Ice Beam**, though in specific titles like *Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee*, it teaches **Brick Break**.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Premium cost**). This pricing typically reflects its status as a high-value offensive move found in Department Stores or Game Corners.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Ice Beam** (historically) or **Brick Break** (contextually) to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Ice Beam:** A Special Ice-type move with 90 Power and 100% Accuracy, featuring a 10% chance to freeze the target.
    * **Brick Break:** A Physical Fighting-type move that shatters barriers like *Reflect*, *Light Screen*, and *Aurora Veil*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in most generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Elite Staple.** TM13 (as Ice Beam) is one of the most important TMs in competitive history. Ice-type coverage is essential for checking Dragon, Ground, and Flying-type threats (e.g., Landorus-T, Garchomp, Rayquaza). As Brick Break, it serves as a vital utility move for Physical attackers to clear screens.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a data-disc type item that interacts with a Pokémon's move-learning capabilities.
