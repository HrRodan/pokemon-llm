## Identity & Utility
**Bridge Mail M** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** A specialized piece of stationery featuring an illustration of a majestically arched bridge (specifically the Marvelous Bridge in Unova). It is a **Consumable/Held** social item that is widely accessible for purchase.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used to facilitate communication between Trainers during Pokémon trades. A player can compose a message using a predefined list of words and attach it to a Pokémon. While a Pokémon is holding this Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC storage system**, ensuring the message is seen by the recipient upon trade.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Technical. In competitive play, Mail acts as a "sticky" item. Any move attempting to forcibly remove, steal, or swap the item—such as **Knock Off, Trick, Switcheroo, or Thief**—will fail. While this protects the holder's item slot, it is generally considered inferior to items that provide stat boosts or healing, such as *Leftovers* or *Life Orb*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is primarily a social and defensive utility item. Once the message is read by the recipient, the Mail can be erased and reused or stored in the Trainer's PC as a keepsake.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized shops, particularly at the gates of the various bridges in the Unova region (such as the Marvelous Bridge, for which the "M" variant is named). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon (`total_held_by: 0`). It must be purchased or received from NPCs.
* **Lore Context:** Bridge Mail is part of a thematic set of stationery in the Unova region (Bridge Mail V, D, S, T, and M), each celebrating one of the region's iconic architectural landmarks. Bridge Mail M specifically highlights the **Marvelous Bridge**, which connects Route 15 and Village Bridge.
