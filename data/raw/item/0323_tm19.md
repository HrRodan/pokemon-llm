## Identity & Utility
**TM19 (Technical Machine 19)** is a **Machine** item introduced in **Generation III** (though the move it contains varies by generation).
* **Description:** A technological device used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Depending on the game version, it teaches moves ranging from **Giga Drain** (recovery) to **Telekinesis** (utility) or **Seismic Toss** (fixed damage). It is a **Consumable** in earlier generations and **Infinite-Use** in later ones (Gen V–VIII).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). This price point is typical for high-tier offensive or utility TMs found in Department Stores.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. Based on the provided metadata:
    * **Legacy (Gen II-IV):** Teaches **Giga Drain**, a Grass-type move that heals the user for 50% of the damage dealt.
    * **Mid-Era (Gen V-VI):** Teaches **Telekinesis**, which makes the target float, ensuring all moves (except OHKO moves) hit it for three turns.
    * **Vintage (Gen I):** Teaches **Seismic Toss**, dealing damage equal to the user's level.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Giga Drain (Gen II-IV / BDSP):** A competitive staple for Grass-types like Venusaur and Celebi, providing essential longevity.
        * **Seismic Toss (Gen I):** Vital for defensive Pokémon like Chansey and Blissey to deal consistent damage.
        * **Telekinesis (Gen V-VI):** Extremely niche; rarely seen in competitive VGC or Smogon formats due to its setup requirement.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to Pokémon with compatible "move pools."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * Commonly purchased at **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, or Lilycove City) for the premium price of 10,000.
    * Often rewarded by **Erika** (the Celadon City Gym Leader) in games where it contains Giga Drain.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly an artificial tool obtained through human commerce or as a reward for training excellence.
* **Regional Variation:** While the item ID remains 323, its contents are regionally distinct—Hoenn and Sinnoh focus on Giga Drain, while Unova focuses on Psychic-type utility.
