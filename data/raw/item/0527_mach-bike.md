## Identity & Utility
**Mach Bike** is a **Key Item (Gameplay)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A high-speed folding bicycle designed for rapid overworld travel. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be sold or discarded. Unlike standard bicycles in other regions, this model prioritizes raw velocity over technical maneuvers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item / Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the player's movement speed significantly (at least twice the walking speed). It is specifically designed to overcome environmental obstacles that require high momentum.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This is strictly an overworld utility item used for exploration and traversing the region.
* **Specialized Mechanics:** 
    * **Momentum-Based Hazards:** The Mach Bike is the only way to ascend **Muddy Slopes** (which require a head-start and continuous speed to climb).
    * **Cracked Floors:** It allows the player to ride over **Cracked Floors** (found in locations like Sky Pillar or Mirage Tower) without falling through, provided they maintain maximum speed and do not stop or turn sharply.
    * **Trade-off:** It lacks the jumping and balancing capabilities of its counterpart, the Acro Bike.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Provided for free by **Rydel at Rydel’s Cycles** in Mauville City. In its debut games (*Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald*) and their remakes (*ORAS*), the player must choose between the Mach Bike and the Acro Bike, though they can return to the shop to swap them at any time.
* **Region Context:** Specifically engineered for the diverse terrain of the Hoenn region. It is culturally iconic to the Gen III experience, often associated with the "Sky Pillar challenge" required to encounter the Legendary Pokémon **Rayquaza**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
