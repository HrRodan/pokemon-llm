## Identity & Utility
**Whipped Cream** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** A sweet, airy condiment used primarily during the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It serves as a culinary additive that influences the "Meal Powers" granted to the player. It is a **consumable ingredient** that can be purchased in bulk from specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Whipped Cream contributes significantly to the **Sweet** flavor profile. It is essential for recipes aiming to trigger specific Meal Powers, such as **Exp. Point Power**, **Raid Power**, or **Encounter Power**, depending on the other ingredients it is paired with.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle; it exists only in the player’s sandwich filling inventory).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held. Its value is strictly relegated to the "overworld" training and hunting phase (e.g., increasing Egg Power for breeding or Exp. Power for leveling).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a component of the **Picnic/Sandwich** subsystem. Unlike the "Whipped Dream" (which evolves Swirlix), this is a culinary ingredient and cannot be used for trade-based evolution.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Deli Cioso** outlets across the Paldea region (notably in Mesagoza, Cortondo, and Cascarrafa) and at the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. It is unlocked for purchase from the start of the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced food product intended for human and Pokémon consumption during picnics, typically gathered via retail purchase rather than the **Pickup** ability.
