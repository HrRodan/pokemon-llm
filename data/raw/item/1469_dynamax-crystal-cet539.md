## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CET539)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, event-exclusive consumable item used specifically within the Galar Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically priced, but practically **Not for Sale**; acquired via promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal activates a Max Raid Battle featuring a specific Pokémon (determined by the internal ID CET539) that persists until the end of the day. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, these crystals guarantee a specific encounter, often with rare Pokémon or those not usually found in that version of the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate a Max Raid Battle for collection, training, or G-Max Factor acquisition; it cannot be held or used in formal VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic. Defeating the summoned Pokémon allows the player an opportunity to catch it, potentially providing access to Hidden Abilities or High-IV specimens.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional tie-ins (such as retail distributions, pre-order bonuses, or movie tickets) during the *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* era. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a digital-only distribution item that does not appear naturally in the Galar ecosystem.
* **Context:** These crystals were designed to drive foot traffic to physical retail locations or reward early adopters of the Galar games, providing a "guaranteed" encounter in a specific location that would otherwise be randomized.
