## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (UMA4905)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a special event-exclusive consumable item. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use "key-style" consumable that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this value is a placeholder as the item is typically distributed via serial codes and cannot be bought in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty den at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to force a specific Pokémon encounter (indicated by the internal ID `uma4905`) to appear as a Max Raid boss.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Utility Only).** While the item itself has no competitive battle effect, these crystals were historically used to grant players early or exclusive access to Pokémon with Hidden Abilities, high IV spreads, or Gigantamax forms which are essential for the VGC and Smogon competitive circuits.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was made available exclusively through **serial code distributions** at various global retailers (such as GameStop, Target, or Best Buy) or as pre-order bonuses. It is not available through natural progression or in-game shops.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. Unlike common items, these are never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. They are strictly promotional digital assets intended to drive community engagement and retail visits.
