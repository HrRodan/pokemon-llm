## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (VIR5107)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable crystal used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. This specific crystal is a promotional event item that summons a specific Pokémon for a limited time. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While assigned a technical cost in the data, it is functionally **Priceless** as it is only obtainable via Serial Code or Mystery Gift distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This specific crystal (VIR5107) is programmed to encounter **Gigantamax Sandaconda**. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no battle utility, it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Gigantamax-capable Pokémon, which can then be used in VGC or Smogon formats that allow Dynamaxing/Gigantamaxing.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, these crystals guarantee a specific species and Gigantamax form.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was made available via **Special Event Distribution (Serial Codes)**. In the context of "VIR5107," this was notably part of a promotion (such as those through retailers like GameStop or Micromania) to give players access to a Gigantamax Sandaconda raid outside of standard dens or event rotations.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a digital distribution item tied to promotional campaigns for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.
