## Identity & Utility
**TM54** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A specialized data disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. In most core series iterations, this TM teaches **False Swipe**, a move designed to facilitate Pokémon capture. In specific variations (such as *Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee*), the move associated with this disc is **Flash Cannon**. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** item (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that is widely available for purchase.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **False Swipe** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **False Swipe:** A Normal-type Physical move that purposefully withholds power, ensuring the target is left with at least **1 HP**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has virtually **no presence in competitive PvP** (VGC/Smogon) due to its inability to knock out opponents, it is considered a **mandatory staple for "Catching Leads"** in the overworld.
    * **Strategic Context:** It is the premier tool for completing the Pokédex and hunting Shiny Pokémon, often taught to "Hunter" Pokémon like Gallade, Parasect, or Breloom.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of "bladed" or "clawed" Pokémon (e.g., Scyther, Garchomp, Zacian).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM54 is one of the most accessible TMs in the franchise. It is commonly sold at **Department Stores** (such as Veilstone City or Goldenrod City) and is often gifted to the player early-to-mid game to assist with completing the Pokédex. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found held by wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired through shops or as a static treasure find in the overworld.
* **World Knowledge (Variation):** In *Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!*, the TM system was renumbered; in those specific titles, TM54 teaches **Flash Cannon** (a Steel-type special attack that can lower Sp. Def), though it reverted to False Swipe in subsequent generations like *Sword & Shield* and *Scarlet & Violet*.
