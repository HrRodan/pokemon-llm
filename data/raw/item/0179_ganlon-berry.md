## Identity & Utility
**Ganlon Berry** is an **"In-a-pinch" Stat-Boosting Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A rare, consumable held item that triggers when the holder's health is critical. It is a **holdable-active** item intended for battle use rather than overworld healing. 
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, though rarely available for direct purchase; typically acquired through cultivation or special NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP falls to **1/4 (25%) or less** of its maximum, the Berry is consumed to raise the Pokémon's **Defense stat by one stage**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. Using Fling will consume the berry and apply the +1 Defense boost to the target.
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it functions as an **Ice-type** attack with **100 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** It is considered a **niche competitive item**. While Defense boosts can help a Pokémon survive a physical hit after a Substitute or Endure, it is generally outclassed by the **Salac Berry** (Speed) or **Liechi Berry** (Attack). It sees specific play in sets utilizing the **Gluttony** ability (allowing consumption at 50% HP) or the **Ripen** ability (doubling the Defense boost to +2).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Abilities:** Synergizes with **Harvest** for infinite recycling and **Unburden**, which doubles the user's Speed once the Berry is consumed. 
    * **Flavor:** In Contests, it is used to create Pokéblocks/Poffins, typically associated with the **Tough** category due to its bitter/sour profile.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically difficult to obtain. In early generations, it was often tied to the **Berry Master**, high-tier Battle Frontier rewards, or special distributions (like the Pokémon Colosseum bonus disc). In modern titles, it is found in late-game Berry trees or via the Mutations mechanic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be grown from a starter seed or obtained via specific NPC gifts. It is a high-yield crop for trainers focusing on defensive "Sub-Petaya/Ganlon" gimmick sets.
