## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cet804)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use event item specifically designed to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair located in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, a specific Dynamax Pokémon will occupy the lair until the end of the current day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that technically has a internal cost but is **not available for purchase** through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; functionally **Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, the crystal emits a beam of light, forcing a Max Raid Battle encounter with a specific Pokémon (designated by the internal ID "cet804"). The encounter remains active until 11:59 PM on the day it is used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a battle move context).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld. Its only competitive relevance is providing a guaranteed encounter for a Pokémon that may possess a Hidden Ability, high Individual Values (IVs), or a Gigantamax factor, which can then be used in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Galar Wild Area. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, these crystals guarantee a specific event-based encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These items were typically distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events (such as pre-order bonuses, movie tie-ins, or retail distributions). They cannot be found via standard gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is an "out-of-bag" event trigger rather than a traditional held item.
* **Context:** In the lore of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated clusters of Galar Particles that can force a Dynamax phenomenon in a localized area, specifically at ancient ruins like the Watchtower Lair.
