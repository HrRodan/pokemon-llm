## Identity & Utility
**Park Ball** is a specialized Poké Ball introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh/Johto).
* **Description:** A unique Poké Ball designed exclusively for use within the **Pal Park** facility. It serves as a mechanical bridge for migrating Pokémon from Generation III (GBA) games to Generation IV (DS) games. It is a **Special-Use Consumable** that **cannot** be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; provided as part of the Pal Park service).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Guaranteed capture (100% catch rate) of any Pokémon encountered within the Pal Park. It ignores all catch rate calculations and status conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in standard wild encounters or trainer battles; it is restricted to the Pal Park instance).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The Park Ball is a utility tool for collection and legacy migration. It has no tactical application in VGC or Smogon formats, as the ball type itself does not confer any stat bonuses or triggered effects.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The Park Ball is not used for evolution. Its sole interaction is with the "Dual-Slot" migration system of the Nintendo DS, where it facilitates the permanent transfer of Pokémon from the Kanto, Hoenn, and Orre regions into the Sinnoh or Johto Pokédexes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed automatically to the player upon entering a **Pal Park** "Catching Show" (located at the end of Route 221 in Sinnoh or in Fuchsia City in Johto). The player is given six Park Balls to recapture the six Pokémon migrated from a GBA cartridge (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, or LeafGreen).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** found on wild Pokémon. It is a government-regulated tool within the Pokémon world's conservation and transfer system, making it impossible to obtain in the overworld or via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Legacy Note:** Once a Pokémon is caught in a Park Ball, its original Poké Ball data is usually retained in its summary in later generations, though in the context of Gen IV, the Park Ball is the physical tool used for the encounter.
