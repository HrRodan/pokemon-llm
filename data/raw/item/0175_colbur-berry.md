## Identity & Utility
**Colbur Berry** is a **Type-Protection Berry** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** A held berry that provides a reactive defensive buffer against specific elemental weaknesses. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is technically priced in data but is primarily obtained through foraging or farming rather than standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is struck by a **super-effective Dark-type attack**, the Berry is consumed to reduce the damage of that hit by **50%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dark-type** attack with **80 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-utility **Competitive Staple** for Psychic and Ghost-type Pokémon. It is frequently equipped on defensive pivots (like **Slowbro** or **Reuniclus**) or setup sweepers to survive powerful Dark-type coverage moves such as *Knock Off*, *Sucker Punch*, or *Crunch*, allowing the user to retaliate or set up Trick Room/Calm Mind.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with abilities like **Harvest** (allowing the berry to be restored) and **Unnerve** (which prevents the opponent from consuming it). It is specifically targeted by the move **Pluck** or **Bug Bite**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found on Berry Trees in the Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos regions. In later generations, it is often obtained through specialized Berry piles or mutation mechanics.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is occasionally found in the wild being held by **Chimecho** and **Chingling** (usually a 5% chance). It can be efficiently farmed using Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** (to increase hold rates) and **Frisk/Covet** abilities.
