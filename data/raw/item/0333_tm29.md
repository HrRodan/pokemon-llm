## Identity & Utility
**TM29** is a **Technical Machine** classified under **All Machines**. While this specific entry is associated with Generation III (Hoenn), TM29 has appeared in every major Pokémon title from Generation I through Generation IX.

*   **Description:** A data disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. Historically, TM29 is iconic for teaching the move **Psychic**, a premier Special-type attack. However, in the *Sword & Shield* era, this specific TM index was repurposed to teach **Charm**.
*   **Usage Context:** It is a **Consumable** (in older and the most recent generations) or **Infinite-Use** (Gens V-VII) item that can be bought at specific vendors.
*   **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches a compatible Pokémon a permanent move. 
    *   **Move (Traditional):** **Psychic** (Type: Psychic | Category: Special | Power: 90 | Accuracy: 100%). It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.
    *   **Move (Gen VIII):** **Charm** (Type: Fairy | Category: Status). Harshly lowers the target's Attack stat by two stages.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **High Staple.** When teaching **Psychic**, it is the gold standard for Psychic-type Special attackers (like Alakazam, Espeon, and Mewtwo) and a vital coverage move for many others. When teaching **Charm**, it serves as a niche defensive tool to neutralize physical sweepers.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Usage is restricted to "compatible" Pokémon, which typically includes most Psychic, Ghost, and high-intelligence Fairy or Normal types.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** 
    *   In classic regions (Kanto/Johto), it is often purchased at large **Department Stores** (Celadon City/Goldenrod City) or received as a gift from **Mr. Psychic** in Saffron City. 
    *   In Hoenn (Gen III), it is found in **Mauville City**. 
    *   In modern games (Gen IX), it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials.
*   **Wild Held Item:** TM29 is never held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a man-made instructional item.
*   **World Context:** Psychic is often considered one of the most powerful moves from the early generations, making TM29 one of the most sought-after TMs for players completing the main story or entering competitive play.
