## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CAR2326)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
*   **Description:** This is a special, consumable event item used exclusively in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to manifest. It acts as a "beacon" that persists until the end of the day or until the raid is completed.
*   **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal cost; effectively **Not for sale** through standard in-game vendors).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, a beam of light is triggered. This specific crystal (CAR2326) is part of a series of promotional items used to encounter **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be thrown in battle).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate a Max Raid Battle encounter and cannot be held by a Pokémon during competitive play.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but the resulting Raid Battle allows players to catch a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which is otherwise rare or requires Max Soup.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** This item was distributed via **special promotional codes** (Serial Codes) given out by retailers (such as GameStop, EB Games, or GAME) during specific event windows for *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It is not obtainable through natural gameplay or the Pokémon Center.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique event-flagged item stored in the "Other" or "Treasures" pocket of the bag.
*   **Lore Context:** The "CAR" prefix in the item's internal name refers to the specific retail distribution campaign it was tied to. These crystals were the primary way The Pokémon Company managed localized retail events in the Galar era without requiring players to visit a physical store's local wireless signal.
