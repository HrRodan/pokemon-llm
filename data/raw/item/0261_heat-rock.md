## Identity & Utility
**Heat Rock** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An orange, crystalline stone that radiates internal heat. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically to interact with weather mechanics. It is **Holdable-Active**, meaning its effect triggers upon the execution of a specific move by the holder. 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Valuable**). While it has a mid-range sell price, it is often treated as a specialized tactical tool rather than a common consumable.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses the move **Sunny Day** (or possesses the Ability **Drought**), the duration of the resulting harsh sunlight is extended from the standard 5 turns to **8 turns**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 60 (Standard physical damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** for "Sun Teams." It is almost mandatory for weather-setters like **Torkoal** or **Ninetales** in Smogon OU or VGC formats to maximize the uptime of Protosynthesis (Paradox Pokémon), Solar Beam, and Fire-type damage boosts.
* **Mechanic Nuance:** The extension is applied to the weather effect at the moment of creation. Unlike items like Choice Band, the 8-turn duration persists even if the Heat Rock holder switches out, is knocked out, or has its item removed via Knock Off *after* the sun is already active.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically retrieved via the **Sinnoh Underground** (mining) or purchased at specialized Battle Frontier/Battle Tree shops for Battle Points (BP) in later generations. In more recent titles, it can often be purchased at Delibird Presents or found in desert-themed environments.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily acquired through **exploration, mining, or as a reward for specialized battle challenges**. Its "underground" attribute highlights its origin as a rare geological specimen found deep within the earth.
