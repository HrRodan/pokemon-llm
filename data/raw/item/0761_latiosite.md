## Identity & Utility
**Latiosite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed for a specific legendary Pokémon. When held by **Latios**, it allows the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle, provided the Trainer has a Mega Bracelet or Mega Ring. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold at standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique key-item-adjacent tool usually obtained through story events or special post-game distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Latios, the Trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution**, transforming the Pokémon into **Mega Latios**. This transformation grants a massive boost to its base stats (specifically Attack, Defense, Special Attack, and Special Defense) and slightly increases its size. The transformation lasts for the duration of the battle or until the Pokémon faints.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. While it can be flung, doing so is highly discouraged as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve for the remainder of the match.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/High-Tier.** In competitive formats (like Smogon’s National Dex or Gen 6/7 OU), Mega Latios is often compared to its base form holding a Life Orb or Soul Dew. While Mega Latios offers superior bulk and the ability to function as a powerful **Mixed Sweeper** (utilizing its buffed 130 Base Attack for moves like Earthquake), its inability to hold a different item sometimes makes it less splashable than standard Latios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Specific User:** Only functions for Latios. It has no effect on Latias (who requires Latiasite).
    * **Anti-Thief Mechanics:** Mega Stones cannot be removed from the holder by moves like **Knock Off**, **Thief**, or **Covet**, and cannot be traded via **Trick** or **Switcheroo** if held by the correct Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Omega Ruby**, it is given by the player's mother or obtained during the Southern Island event.
    * In **Alpha Sapphire**, it is typically obtained via trade or post-game from the player's mother.
    * In **Generation VII (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon)**, it is purchased via Battle Points (BP) at the Battle Tree.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This item is unique and typically restricted to one per save file (outside of Battle Tree purchases), making it a high-value asset for any competitive roster.
