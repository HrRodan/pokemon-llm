## Identity & Utility
**Feebas Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed by the Feebas evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** used primarily at the TM Machine in the Paldea and Kitakami regions. Unlike traditional items, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket and cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 35 Poké Dollars/League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**; standard value for common Pokémon drops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine. It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to create single-use TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it provides no battle-time bonuses and cannot be equipped.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it shares a name with the Pokémon Feebas, this item is **not** used to trigger its evolution into Milotic (which requires the *Prism Scale*). It is strictly an industrial resource for move-teaching.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Feebas** or **Milotic**. In Generation IX, these are primarily found in the crystalline waters of the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a guaranteed or high-probability reward drop from the following Pokémon:
    * **Feebas**
    * **Milotic**
* **Context:** In the Pokémon world economy, these scales represent the biological markers of the "Fish Pokémon," used to synthesize the data necessary to teach complex moves to other Pokémon.
