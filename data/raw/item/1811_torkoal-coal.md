## Identity & Utility
**Torkoal Coal** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specific material dropped by wild Torkoal after being defeated or caught. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** used exclusively at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon to provide a buff.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its use as a "League Point" (LP) substitute or crafting component.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea region, players must combine Torkoal Coal with League Points (LP) to create moves that Torkoal is known for.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** This item has no impact on competitive battle stats but is essential for team building to unlock high-tier Fire-type or utility moves for other Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Generation IX move-learning sub-system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after battling wild **Torkoal**. These are most commonly found in mountainous or volcanic biomes, such as the **Province areas** of Paldea.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is a guaranteed or high-probability **drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter. It is often gathered in bulk by players using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature to farm materials quickly.
* **Context:** Torkoal Coal represents the physical byproduct of the coal burned inside a Torkoal's shell. It carries the essence of the Pokémon's intense internal heat, making it a logical component for crafting powerful Fire-type TMs like **TM157 (Overheat)** or **TM118 (Heat Wave)**.
