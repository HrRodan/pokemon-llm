## Identity & Utility
**TM17** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in its current form in **Generation II** (historically teaching Submission in Gen I).
* **Description:** A move-teaching device that enables a compatible Pokémon to learn **Protect**. It is a **Consumable** (in older generations) or **Re-usable** (in mid-generations) item that **Can** be bought at major retailers.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-to-High Price**; reflects its high utility in competitive play).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Protect**. When used in battle, Protect enables the user to evade all incoming attacks, including damaging moves and most status moves, for the duration of the turn. Its success rate drops significantly if used in succession.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with Fling for damage/effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Absolute Staple.** In VGC (Doubles), Protect is considered the most important move in the game for positioning and stalling out opposing field effects (like Trick Room or Tailwind). In Singles, it is a core component of "Stall" archetypes, allowing for free recovery via Leftovers or chip damage from Poison/Burn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** TM17 has one of the highest compatibility rates of any machine; almost every Pokémon capable of learning TMs can learn Protect. It does not trigger any evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available for purchase at **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove, or Shopping Mall Nine). In recent generations like Scarlet/Violet, it can be crafted at the TM Machine using Pokémon materials (specifically Lechonk Hair and Scatterbug Powder).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally an artificial item manufactured for trainers.
* **Historical Context:** While this JSON identifies its generation info as Generation III (Hoenn), TM17 is famous for its transition: it taught the Fighting-type move **Submission** in the Kanto region (Gen I) before being permanently assigned to **Protect** from Johto (Gen II) onwards.
