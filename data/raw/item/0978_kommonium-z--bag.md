## Identity & Utility
**Kommonium Z** is a **Specialized Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** This item converts Z-Power into a specialized crystal that allows **Kommo-o** to upgrade its signature move, *Clanging Scales*, into a unique and powerful Z-Move. Within the "Bag" context, it represents the player's possession of the crystal, which is a **Key Item/Held Item hybrid** that cannot be consumed or lost.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest/event item that cannot be traded or sold.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Kommo-o** that knows the move **Clanging Scales**, it allows the use of the exclusive Z-Move: **Clangorous Soulblaze**. 
    * **Clangorous Soulblaze:** This is a Dragon-type special attack with a base power of **185**. Upon successful execution, it deals massive damage to all adjacent opponents and **increases the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each** (an "Omniboost").
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen 7).** In the Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon meta (VGC 2018/2019 and Smogon OU), Kommonium Z was the primary reason for Kommo-o's high tier placement. The ability to deal spread damage while simultaneously setting up a full-stat sweep made it one of the most threatening Z-Moves in the game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Exclusive:** Only functions with Kommo-o. It does not affect its pre-evolutions, Hakamo-o or Jangmo-o.
    * **Immunity:** As a Z-Crystal, it cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, and the holder is unaffected by the ability *Trick* or *Klutz* regarding this specific item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is obtained at the **Plains Grotto** on Poni Island after the player has completed the trial at the Vast Poni Canyon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique item tied to the Alolan trials and the lore of the "Scaly Pokémon" lineage.
* **World Knowledge:** In the transition to Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), Z-Moves were removed from the game, making this item a "Legacy Item" exclusive to Alola-region titles.
