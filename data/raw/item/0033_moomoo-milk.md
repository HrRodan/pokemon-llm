## Identity & Utility
**Moomoo Milk** is a **Consumable Medicine** introduced in Generation II (recorded in Gen III datasets).
* **Description:** A bottle of highly nutritious milk sourced from Miltank. It is a consumable healing item that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. It is widely considered a mid-to-high tier restorative, sitting between the Super Potion (60 HP) and the Hyper Potion (120/200 HP depending on the game engine).
* **Cost:** 600 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cost-Effective**). At 6 HP per 1 Poké Dollar, it offers significantly better value than Hyper Potions or Max Potions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores exactly **100 HP** to a single Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Base damage; no additional secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in **Playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**. It is rarely seen in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) because it requires a turn to use from the bag (prohibited in most formats) or provides no passive recovery compared to items like Leftovers or Sitrus Berries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While not an evolution item, it is thematically tied to the move **Milk Drink**. It is a "holdable" item, though it does not trigger automatically in battle like a Berry; a Pokémon holding it provides no benefit unless the Trainer uses it from the bag or the move *Bestow* is involved.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically sold at specialized locations rather than standard Poké Marts, such as the **Moomoo Farm** in Johto or the **Café Cabin** in Sinnoh. In many regions, it can be purchased in bulk (dozens), making it the preferred healing item for mid-game travel.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Miltank** (100% chance in some generations if encountered in specific events, usually a 5% or 10% hold rate otherwise). It is a frequent drop for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at mid-level ranges (typically Levels 11–60 depending on the specific game).
