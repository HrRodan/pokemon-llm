## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal LEO4057** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A special event-exclusive consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. This specific crystal (LEO4057) is associated with spawning **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired via special distribution/serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is activated. This allows the player to challenge a specific Max Raid Battle regardless of the current den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A as a held item. However, it is highly valuable for competitive players as it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon possessing the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was historically required for certain Pokémon to Gigantamax in VGC (Video Game Championships) before the introduction of Max Soup.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts solely with the **Watchtower Lair** environment mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These items are **Event-Only**. They were typically distributed via serial codes from retailers (such as GameStop or Micromania) or as pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass or Dual Pack.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique promotional item that is consumed upon activation at the designated den.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals like LEO4057 allowed players to access rare Gigantamax forms earlier in the game or outside of standard den RNG, making them a significant "Catch-up" or "Promotional" mechanic during the Generation VIII era.
