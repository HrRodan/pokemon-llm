## Identity & Utility
**Heracross Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Single Horn Pokémon, Heracross. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any tactical benefit.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**; primarily used for its trade-in value for League Points [LP] or as a component in the TM Machine).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a specific resource for the **TM Machine** located at Pokémon Centers. It is required to craft technical machines that match Heracross's move pool or physical characteristics.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is essential for teaching powerful physical moves to other Pokémon. 
    * **Crafting Recipe Examples:** It is a core component for crafting high-value TMs such as **TM088 (Swords Dance)** and **TM105 (X-Scissor)**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after battling wild Heracross. It is rewarded regardless of whether the player catches or defeats the Pokémon (including Auto-Battles via the "Let's Go!" feature).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. Instead, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Heracross**, typically found in forested areas such as North Province (Area Two) or the Socarrat Trail in the Paldea region.
* **Lore Context:** The claw represents the physical prowess of Heracross, a Pokémon known for its immense strength and sharp appendages used for grappling and piercing. In the Paldean ecosystem, trainers collect these discarded or harvested parts to synthesize data for TMs.
