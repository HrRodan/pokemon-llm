## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ori1903)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, event-exclusive consumable used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It is a single-use event item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (System placeholder; functionally **Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When taken to the Watchtower Ruins in the Wild Area, this crystal activates the den, causing a specific Pokémon (associated with the "ori1903" event distribution) to appear as a Max Raid Battle. The encounter remains active until the end of the day or until the raid is completed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its value is strictly for the "overworld" collection phase. However, the Pokémon caught via this raid are often used in competitive play, as they typically possess high Individual Values (IVs) or Hidden Abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the Watchtower Lair raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Code** as part of promotional tie-ins (such as Japanese retail events or CoroCoro magazine distributions). It is not available through Marts or standard exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Acquisition" item meant for event-based distribution only.
