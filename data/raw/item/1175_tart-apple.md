## Identity & Utility
**Tart Apple** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, exceptionally tart fruit used to trigger the evolution of a specific Pokémon species. It is a **Consumable** item that, while historically rare and version-exclusive, is now moderately priced.
* **Cost:** 2,200 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on an **Applin**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Flapple**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** The Tart Apple itself holds no competitive value as a held item. However, it is the exclusive gateway to obtaining **Flapple**, a physical glass cannon known for its signature move *Grav Apple* and the *Hustle* ability. It serves as the offensive counterpart to the Sweet Apple (which produces the defensive Appletun).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is consumed upon use. It is specifically coded to interact only with the Applin evolutionary line and does not function on other "apple-like" Pokémon such as Bounsweet.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Galar Region:** Originally introduced as a version-exclusive item in *Pokémon Sword*. It is typically obtained via a side-quest in Hammerlocke (giving an Applin to a romantic NPC) or found as a recurring hidden item under trees in the Wild Area (notably Axew's Eye).
    * **Paldea Region:** Readily available for purchase at **Delibird Presents** branches after the player has obtained a sufficient number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In its debut generation, it was strictly a world-interactable item or quest reward, though it can now be gathered in bulk in later titles via specialized shops or sparkling floor drops in the Terarium (Indigo Disk).
