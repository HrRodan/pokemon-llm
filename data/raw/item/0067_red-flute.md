## Identity & Utility
**Red Flute** is a **Flute** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized status-curing item made from blown glass. Its unique melody is designed to snap a Pokémon out of the "Infatuation" (Attract) status condition. It is a **Consumable** item (in modern iterations) that is technically **Holdable**, though its primary use is as a manual curative.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While the data suggests a low purchase price, it is traditionally acquired through non-monetary means, such as trading Volcanic Ash at a glass workshop.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during battle, it immediately **cures the Attraction (Infatuation) status**. Unlike most curative items, it targets a mental state rather than a physical ailment like Poison or Paralysis.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional status effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Playthrough focus.** In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), the Red Flute is rarely seen because Infatuation is a secondary, unreliable status. The **Mental Herb** is generally preferred as it activates automatically to cure Infatuation, Taunt, and Encore, whereas the Red Flute requires a manual turn to use.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Glass Flute" set (Blue, Yellow, Red, White, Black) originating from Route 113 in Hoenn.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally crafted by the Glass Blower on **Route 113** in the Hoenn region in exchange for **500 steps worth of Volcanic Ash**. In later generations, it is occasionally available through specialized vendors or as a rare reward. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically a crafted or gifted item.
* **Lore Context:** The Red Flute is a staple of Hoenn's glass-blowing culture. Unlike the Poké Flute, which is used for awakening, the Red Flute's frequency is tuned specifically to break the psychological "infatuation" caused by moves like Attract or the ability Cute Charm.
