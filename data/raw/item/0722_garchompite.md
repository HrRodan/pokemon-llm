## Identity & Utility
**Garchompite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to be held by the Dragon/Ground-type Pokémon Garchomp. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is essential for triggering Mega Evolution. It cannot be consumed or used from the bag; it must be held in battle to function.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). As a Mega Stone, it is never sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained through post-game exploration, specific NPC gifts, or high-tier Battle Facility rewards (like the Battle Tree).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Garchomp, it allows the Pokémon to undergo **Mega Evolution** during a battle, transforming it into Mega Garchomp. This change grants a massive increase to its Attack and Special Attack stats and replaces its ability with **Sand Force** (which boosts the power of Rock, Ground, and Steel-type moves by 30% in a Sandstorm).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. Note: While it has a high Fling power, Mega Stones generally cannot be removed, stolen, or flung in battle if the holder is the correct species (Garchomp) due to the permanent bond of Mega Evolution.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Strategic.** Unlike many Mega Evolutions, Garchompite presents a tactical trade-off. Mega Garchomp’s base Speed drops from 102 to 92, meaning it loses the ability to outspeed many common threats (like Base 100 speed tiers). It is primarily used on **Sand Teams** to capitalize on the *Sand Force* boost or as a mixed-attacker wallbreaker.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is species-specific. It has no effect on any Pokémon other than Garchomp. It bypasses the effects of the ability *Klutz* if the Pokémon is already Mega Evolved, though *Klutz* will prevent the initial transformation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (X/Y), it was hidden in Victory Road, accessible only after upgrading the Mega Ring. In subsequent games like Sun/Moon, it was available via the Battle Tree for 64 BP. It is treated as a "one-of-a-kind" treasure in most regional playthroughs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique artifact that requires a "Key Stone" held by the Trainer to activate. Unlike Berries or common items, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
