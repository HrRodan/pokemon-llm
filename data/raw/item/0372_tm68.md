## Identity & Utility
**TM68 (Technical Machine 68)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** It is a data-encoding device used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. As a Technical Machine, its usage has evolved from single-use (consumable) in early generations to infinite-use in mid-generations, and back to consumable in recent titles. 
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price tag reflects its status as a "hyper-tier" move teaching device.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Giga Impact** to a compatible Pokémon. Giga Impact is a powerful Normal-type physical attack with 150 Base Power that requires the user to recharge on the following turn (the physical counterpart to Hyper Beam).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with Fling or have no base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche/Situational**. While it has immense raw power, the "recharge" turn makes the user vulnerable to setup or revenge killing. It is occasionally seen on Pokémon with the **Recharge**-canceling abilities (in specific side-games) or as a last-resort "nuke" in 3v3 singles. In Generation 8, it saw use as a base for **Max Strike** to lower opponent speed.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Compatibility is highest among fully evolved Pokémon and "bruiser" archetypes (e.g., Snorlax, Slaking, Garchomp).
* **Note on Variation:** While the primary data lists Giga Impact, in the **Sword/Shield** era (Gen 8), this TM briefly taught **Fire Fang**, illustrating a rare shift in TM numbering before returning to its traditional high-power roots.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available at **Department Stores** (such as Veilstone, Celadon, or Lilycove) and the **Battle Frontier/Battle Maison** for high amounts of BP (Battle Points). Its high cost (30,000) categorizes it as a late-game luxury item.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be purchased, found in specific overworld locations (often late-game routes), or crafted via a TM Machine in the Paldea region.
* **World Context:** TM68 represents the pinnacle of physical Normal-type offense, often given as a reward for high-level trainers or sold in exclusive shops to signify a trainer's progression into the elite tiers of competition.
