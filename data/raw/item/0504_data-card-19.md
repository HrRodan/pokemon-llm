## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 19** is a **Data Card** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** This specialized tracking item is part of the Pokéathlon sub-game. It functions as a record-keeping device that specifically monitors the trainer's performance in wireless multiplayer competitions. It is a **Key Item-style Data Card** that **cannot be bought** with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In-game, these cards are typically exchanged for Athlete Points (AP) at the Pokéathlon Dome.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the cumulative number of times the trainer has secured a **first-place overall finish** in the **Link Pokéathlon** (wireless multiplayer mode).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the Key Items pocket or a specific Data Card case).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on Smogon or VGC formats; its utility is strictly limited to tracking mini-game statistics for completionists and Pokéathlon enthusiasts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It serves purely as a data-logging tool for the Pokéathlon Dome's record systems.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquired at the **Pokéathlon Dome** (located north of Goldenrod City in Johto). Players must earn Athlete Points by participating in events to "purchase" this card from the rewards shop.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Context:** Data Card 19 is one of 27 collectible cards that fill out the player's Pokéathlon record book, providing a granular look at their history as an athlete. While the API lists the region as Sinnoh (Gen IV), this item is functionally exclusive to the Johto-based *HeartGold/SoulSilver* titles.
