## Identity & Utility
**Resist Wing** is a **Vitamin** (Effort Value enhancer) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used to increase a Pokémon's defensive potential. Unlike high-potency vitamins like Iron, the Resist Wing provides a subtle boost to "base points" (Effort Values). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that is typically found in the overworld or purchased at specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). Its low price point makes it an efficient alternative for fine-tuning stats compared to the much more expensive Iron (10,000 Poké Dollars).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the target Pokémon's **Defense Effort Values (EVs) by 1**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While not a held item used *during* battle, it is a **Competitive Preparation Essential**. In high-level play (VGC/Smogon), trainers often need specific EV spreads (e.g., 252 HP / 4 Def). Because standard Vitamins provide 10 EVs, Wings are the primary method for "topping off" a stat or hitting precise defensive benchmarks without overshooting the 510 total EV limit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is unaffected by most held-item abilities as it is consumed from the bag, though it can be sold or traded.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally found in "shadows" on bridges in the Unova region (such as Driftveil Bridge or Marvelous Bridge). In later generations (Galar and Paldea), they are frequently found as **sparkling dropped items** in the overworld or rewarded for participating in Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; however, it is frequently gathered in bulk through overworld exploration and "scavenging" mechanics rather than traditional Mart purchases. Unlike the "Iron" vitamin, Resist Wings do not have a usage cap—they can be used to raise a stat from 0 all the way to 252, provided the trainer has enough of them.
