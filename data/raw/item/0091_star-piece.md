## Identity & Utility
**Star Piece** is a **Loot** item introduced in Generation II (with significant utility expanded in Generation IV).
* **Description:** A shard of a beautiful, red-sparkling gem. It is a **Consumable Treasure** that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts; it is intended to be found and sold or traded for rare resources.
* **Cost:** 12,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value Vendor Trash**). While the internal cost is 12,000, it typically sells for 6,000, though specific NPCs (like the Ore Collector) may pay a premium.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its main function is as a high-value trade commodity. It can be sold for a significant profit to fund expensive items like TMs, Vitamins, or Ultra Balls.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no tactical advantage in battle and is never held by Pokémon in a competitive Smogon or VGC environment. Its value is strictly economic or for NPC bartering.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Bartering (Gen IV):** In *Pokémon Platinum*, it can be traded to the Shard Collector for one of each color shard (Red, Blue, Yellow, and Green), which are used for Move Tutoring.
    * **Bartering (Gen V):** In *Black and White*, it can be traded for a **PP Up** once per day in Icirrus City.
    * **Sinnoh Underground:** Categorized as an "Underground" item, frequently found via the mining minigame.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as a hidden item (requiring the Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine) in beaches, craters, or mountainous terrain. In the Sinnoh region, it is a frequent reward for mining in the **Great Underground**.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature held item for celestial or crystalline Pokémon. It is occasionally found on wild **Staryu**, **Starmie**, and **Minior** (all colors). It is also associated with Mythical Pokémon like **Jirachi** and **Meloetta**. Farming these via the **Pickup** ability or the move **Thief** is a viable late-game credit-farming strategy.
