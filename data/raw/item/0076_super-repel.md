## Identity & Utility
**Super Repel** is a **Spelunking/Overworld Utility** item introduced in Generation I (refined in Generation IV data).
* **Description:** An aerosol spray that prevents wild Pokémon from appearing for a set distance. It specifically masks the player's presence from wild Pokémon with a lower level than the current lead Pokémon in the party. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at most Poké Marts once the player has obtained a sufficient number of Gym Badges.
* **Cost:** 700 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Prevents wild Pokémon encounters for **200 steps**. This effect only applies to wild Pokémon whose level is lower than the Pokémon currently at the head of the player's party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it is strictly an overworld utility.
* **Hierarchy & Efficiency:**
    * **Tier:** Mid-grade. It is superior to the standard **Repel** (100 steps) but yields to the **Max Repel** (250 steps).
    * **Efficiency Note:** In many games, the Super Repel is mathematically the most cost-effective repellent, offering a lower "cost-per-step" (3.5 Poké Dollars/step) compared to the Max Repel (typically 3.6 Poké Dollars/step).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Available at Poké Marts and Department Stores across all regions. It typically becomes available for purchase after the player earns their second or third Gym Badge.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through shops or as "hidden items" found using the Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine in caves and tall grass.
* **Nuzlocke Utility:** Highly valued in "Nuzlocke" challenge runs to safely navigate through "encounter-heavy" areas like caves (e.g., Mt. Moon, Rock Tunnel) to reach specific sub-areas or to preserve health before a major battle.
