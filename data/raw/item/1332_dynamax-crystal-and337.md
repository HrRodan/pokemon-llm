## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AND337** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the **Watchtower Lair**, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to trigger, persisting until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable** item that is **not available through standard gameplay** (Special Acquisition).
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but effectively a placeholder value as these items are distributed via Serial Codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area causes a specific Pokémon (denoted by the internal ID AND337) to appear as a Max Raid Battle encounter. Unlike standard Max Raid dens which are randomized, this crystal guarantees a specific encounter.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly for acquisition, allowing players to catch Pokémon that might be version-exclusive or possess Hidden Abilities/High IVs for later use in competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It serves as a gateway to **Max Raid Battles**, allowing players to earn Exp. Candies, TRs, and Dynamax Shards upon the Pokémon's defeat.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily through **special promotions, pre-order bonuses, or retail serial codes** (such as those from Pokémon Pass or GameStop). It is not found in shops or as standard loot.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only event trigger.
* **World Context:** The "AND" series of Dynamax Crystals are part of a large index of event-exclusive encounters designed to drive engagement with the Max Raid mechanic outside of the standard "Rolling Fields" rotation. Using one clears any existing raid at the Watchtower Lair and replaces it with the crystal's specific Pokémon.
