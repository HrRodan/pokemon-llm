## Identity & Utility
**Bike (Green)** is an **Unused / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A folding bicycle designed to allow the player to travel across the overworld at a significantly higher speed than Running Shoes. While it possesses flavor text suggesting it is a standard mobility tool, it is categorized as "unused" within the Generation VII game data. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In traditional Pokémon gameplay, the Bike increases movement speed and allows access to specific terrains (like Cycling Roads or muddy slopes). However, because this specific green variant is categorized as "unused" in the Alola region (where **Poke Ride** replaced traditional Bicycles), it has no functional effect in standard gameplay and exists only within the game's internal code.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a mobility-focused Key Item with no application in VGC, Smogon, or in-battle scenarios.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon and does not interact with abilities such as Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable** through normal gameplay. While the item data exists in the files of *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, the Alola region utilizes the **Poke Ride** system (specifically Tauros Charge and Stoutland Search) for land travel, rendering the physical Bicycle obsolete for the protagonist.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique Key Item intended for the player's Bag.
* **World Knowledge:** The presence of colored bike variants (Green, etc.) in the game code often suggests developmental testing for customization options that were ultimately scrapped in favor of the region-specific Poke Ride mechanics. In previous generations, the Bike was the primary method of fast travel before the introduction of the Rotom Bike (Gen VIII) or Cyclizar/Ride Pokémon (Gen IX).
