## Identity & Utility
**Lunalium-Z** is a **Signature Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically debuting in *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*).
* **Description:** A crystallized form of Z-Power specifically keyed to the energies of the legendary Pokémon Lunala. It is a **Held Item** that cannot be consumed, traded, or removed from its holder during battle via moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key story acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If held by a **Lunala** or **Dawn Wings Necrozma** that knows the move **Moongeist Beam**, this crystal allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the specialized Z-Move: **Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom**.
    * **Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom:** A powerful Ghost-type attack (200 Base Power) that ignores the target's Abilities (effectively retaining the "Shadow Shield-piercing" property of the original Moongeist Beam).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Impact Nuke.** In its debut generation (VGC 2018/2019 and Smogon Ubers), Lunalium-Z was a premier choice for Dawn Wings Necrozma and Lunala. It provides a guaranteed one-hit KO (OHKO) on many neutral threats and bypasses defensive abilities like *Multiscale* or *Sturdy*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Requirement:** Does not trigger evolution. It strictly requires the move *Moongeist Beam* to function.
    * **Special Synergy:** While designed for Lunala, it is most frequently seen on **Dawn Wings Necrozma** in competitive play due to Necrozma's higher offensive ceiling and access to *Ultra Burst* (though holding a Z-Crystal prevents the use of Ultranecrozium-Z).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, the player receives this item at the **Mahalo Trail** after defeating or capturing Necrozma (or at the Lake of the Sunne/Moone depending on the version/story progression). It is not available in the original *Sun and Moon* titles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind item linked to the player's status as an Alolan Island Challenge participant.
* **Lore:** Representing the pinnacle of lunar energy, this crystal focuses the "light that consumes the moon" into a concentrated burst of interdimensional power.
