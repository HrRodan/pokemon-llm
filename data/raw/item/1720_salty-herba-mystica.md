## Identity & Utility
**Salty Herba Mystica** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A rare, miraculous herb found within the Paldea region. It is characterized by its intense salty flavor and immense nutritional value. As a specialized ingredient, it is used exclusively in the **Picnic/Sandwich** mechanic to trigger high-level Meal Powers. It is a **Consumable Rare Drop** that **Cannot** be bought at any standard Mart or vendor.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Priceless**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as an ingredient in a sandwich, it provides a massive boost to Meal Power points. It is most famous for being a primary component in "Sparkling Power Lv. 3" recipes, which drastically increases the odds of encountering **Shiny Pokémon**, and "Title Power Lv. 3," which increases the odds of finding Pokémon with **Marks**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no direct utility in a Pokémon battle, it is considered a **Mandatory Meta-Resource** for competitive players and collectors. It is the most sought-after variant of the Herba Mystica because its internal point values allow for the most flexible "Shiny Hunting" recipes across almost every Pokémon type.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve Pokémon. However, it is a critical plot item in the **Path of Legends** storyline, where it is used to restore the health and traversal abilities of the box legendary (Koraidon or Miraidon) and heal Arven's Mabosstiff.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a rare random drop from **5-Star and 6-Star Tera Raid Battles**. It is not found in the overworld after the initial story completion. Certain Tera Raid bosses, such as **Blissey, Amoonguss, and Cetitan**, are known to have higher drop tables for this specific herb.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon.
* **Lore:** Legend states these herbs were guarded by **Titan Pokémon** and possess the power to instantly restore vitality. The Salty variant was specifically guarded by the **Stony Cliff Titan, Klawf**, in the South Province of Paldea.
