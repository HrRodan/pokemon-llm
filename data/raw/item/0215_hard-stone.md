## Identity & Utility
**Hard Stone** is a Type-enhancement Held Item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An unbreakable, rugged stone designed to be held by a Pokémon. It specifically amplifies the concussive force of Rock-type attacks. As a **Competitive Held Item**, it is non-consumable and remains active throughout the duration of a battle.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, it increases the power of the holder’s Rock-type moves by **20%**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (High damage). This makes it a viable high-damage projectile for users of the move Fling, though it provides no secondary status effect upon impact.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Mid-tier. It is often outclassed by the *Life Orb* (which boosts all moves by 30% at the cost of HP) or *Choice Band* (which boosts Attack by 50% but locks moves). However, it is a staple in "no-downside" builds for Rock-type wallbreakers (like Aggron or Gigalith) who want to boost their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) without suffering recoil or being forced to switch.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. It is categorized as an **underground** item, meaning it is frequently obtainable through mining mini-games (such as the Sinnoh Grand Underground).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found in caves, mountainous routes, or via specialty shops in later generations. In Sinnoh-based games, it is a frequent reward from the Underground/mining mechanics.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is highly farmable in the wild. It is frequently held by a variety of Rock-type Pokémon, most notably:
    * **Graveler / Golem**
    * **Onix**
    * **Aron / Lairon / Aggron**
    * **Roggenrola / Boldore / Gigalith**
    * **Dwebble / Crustle**
    * **Nosepass / Probopass**
    * It is often gathered by players using the **Thief** or **Covet** moves on these wild encounters.
