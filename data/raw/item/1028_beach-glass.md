## Identity & Utility
**Beach Glass** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A piece of colored glass with edges rounded by the ocean's waves, resulting in a slightly rough texture. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **Cannot** be bought; its primary purpose is to be liquidated for currency.
* **Cost:** 800 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Value**). While not as lucrative as a Nugget or Big Pearl, it serves as a steady source of income during the mid-game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item has no functional use in battle, training, or evolution. Its sole mechanic is its high sell price at Poké Marts and vendors.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is "Vendor Trash" with no tactical application in VGC or Smogon formats. It should never be equipped as a held item in a competitive setting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is part of the "valuable item" tier, similar to Pretty Feathers or Tiny Mushrooms, intended to reward players for exploration.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly found as a hidden item in beach environments (such as Route 19, 20, and 21 in Kanto). In the *Let's Go* series, it is frequently discovered by the player's **Partner Pokémon** or a **Following Pokémon** when they react to hidden objects in the sand.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon; it is primarily obtained through overworld scavenging and the "hidden item" mechanic rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
