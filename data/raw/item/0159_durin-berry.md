## Identity & Utility
**Durin Berry** is a **Baking-Only Ingredient Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn region)**.
* **Description:** A large, hard berry covered in sharp spikes. It is classified as a "baking-only" item, meaning it provides no direct HP or status restoration when consumed. Its primary purpose is as a raw material for crafting Pokémon snacks to improve Contest conditions. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that is technically purchasable but more commonly grown.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Durin Berry has **no direct effect** in battle or the overworld when used directly. It is specifically designed for planting in soil to yield more berries or for processing into **Pokéblocks** (Hoenn) and **Poffins** (Sinnoh).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Water-type** attack with a base power of **100** (Gen VI+) or **80** (Gen IV–V).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-existent.** Aside from a very specific surprise *Natural Gift* lure in older generations to hit Fire, Ground, or Rock types, it holds no value in competitive Smogon or VGC formats as it provides no passive recovery or stat boosts.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Used primarily to increase a Pokémon's **Cleverness** (Bitterness) or **Toughness** (Sourness) stats for Pokémon Contests. It does not trigger any specific Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired from the Berry Master’s house, specific NPCs in the Sinnoh region, or found on Berry Trees in routes with high-growth soil. Because of its low cost, it is often treated as a "filler" berry in inventory management.
* **Wild Held Item:** This berry is not naturally held by wild Pokémon in the core series games; it must be obtained via farming or NPC gifts. 
* **Lore Context:** Known for its extremely bitter and sour flavor profile, making it a high-yield ingredient for specialized Poffins but unpalatable for direct consumption. In the Sinnoh region, it is a staple for high-level coordinators looking to maximize their Pokémon's "Clever" condition.
