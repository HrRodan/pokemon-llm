## Identity & Utility
**Galarica-cuff** is a **Collectibles (Evolution Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized accessory handcrafted from woven-together Galarica Twigs. While classified under collectibles, its primary function is as a specific evolutionary catalyst. It is a **Consumable** item that is typically obtained through crafting rather than standard retail.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate Value**; primarily reflects resale value as it is not found in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a **Galarian Slowpoke**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Galarian Slowbro**. Unlike many evolution items that are held during trade, this is used directly like an Evolution Stone.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects upon contact).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no passive benefits in battle and is consumed upon use. Its value is strictly limited to the acquisition of Galarian Slowbro for use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific to the "Slowbro" branch of the Galarian Slowpoke line. It cannot be used to evolve Galarian Slowpoke into Galarian Slowking (which requires a *Galarica Wreath*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the *Pokémon Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass (The Isle of Armor), players must collect **8 Galarica Twigs** and bring them to an NPC on an island in the **Workout Sea** to have the cuff woven. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. Players must manually scavenge for Galarica Twigs (found as hidden sparkling items under trees on the Isle of Armor) to "craft" this item, making it a unique resource-management requirement for completing the Galar Dex.
* **Lore Context:** The "happiness" mentioned in the flavor text refers to the biological reaction Galarian Slowpoke has to the Galarica plant's spices, which triggers the chemical change necessary for its unique regional evolution.
