## Identity & Utility
**Exp. Candy XS** is a **Consumable Medicine (Experience Booster)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** The smallest tier in the Experience Candy hierarchy. It is a candy packed with energy that, when consumed, grants a single Pokémon a very small amount of Experience Points. It is a **Consumable** item that is technically valued at a low price but is primarily earned through gameplay rather than standard shop purchases.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily a reward-based item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon, it grants exactly **100 Exp. Points**. Unlike Rare Candies, which increase a Pokémon's level by exactly one regardless of the current XP curve, Exp. Candy XS provides a fixed numerical value, making it more efficient for low-level Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals low-tier physical damage; has no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Post-Game Utility.** While it has no utility *during* a competitive match, it is a staple for competitive players to quickly level up freshly hatched or caught Pokémon to reach specific level caps (e.g., Level 50 for VGC) or to prepare them for Hyper Training (Level 100).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly facilitates **Level-Up Evolutions** by providing the necessary experience to hit specific level thresholds.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for completing **Max Raid Battles** (Sword/Shield) or **Tera Raid Battles** (Scarlet/Violet), specifically from 1-Star raids. It is rarely sold in standard Poké Marts and is treated as a common reward for low-tier cooperative challenges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a reward for battle excellence or found as hidden items in the overworld (specifically in the Wild Area or Area Zero).
