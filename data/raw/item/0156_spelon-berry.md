## Identity & Utility
**Spelon Berry** is a **Baking-Only Berry** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn Region).
* **Description:** Unlike medicinal berries, the Spelon Berry has no direct healing or status-curing properties in battle. It is primarily used as a high-quality ingredient for creating **Pokéblocks** in Hoenn and **Poffins** in Sinnoh to improve a Pokémon's Contest conditions. It is a **Consumable/Plantable** item that is technically purchasable but rarely sold in standard shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively for planting/harvesting and as a cooking substrate. In the context of Pokémon Contests, it is valued for its **Spicy** and **Dry** flavor profile, which raises the **Cool** and **Beauty** attributes of a Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no secondary effect upon contact).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dark-type** attack with **90 Power** (Gen IV-V) or **70 Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It holds no tactical value in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it provides no passive recovery or stat boosts. Its only theoretical use was as a niche Natural Gift surprise in older generations.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is primarily interacted with via the **Berry Pots** or **Soil Patches** for agriculture, and the **Poffin Maker/Berried Blender** for cooking.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut generations, it was a rare berry obtained from the **Berry Master’s Wife** (Hoenn) by telling her the phrase "GREAT BATTLE," or from the **Berry Professor** in Sinnoh. It is generally not available in Poké Marts and must be farmed by the player to increase stock.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to NPC gifts, specific in-game events, or the **Pickup** ability in very specific regional tables (though rare).
* **Lore Context:** The flavor text highlights its cultural significance in the Sinnoh region, where it is a preferred ingredient for traditional sweets known as Poffins, used to groom Pokémon for high-level stage performances.
