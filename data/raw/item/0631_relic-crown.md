## Identity & Utility
**Relic Crown** is a **Loot Item** (Valuable) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An ancient artifact crafted approximately 3,000 years ago. It is a high-value **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot** be purchased. In the context of world-building, it is the most prestigious piece of the "Relic" series found in the Abyssal Ruins.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It represents the highest tier of "vendor trash" in the series, commanding an exceptional resale price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Relic Crown has no functional use in battle or the overworld. Its sole purpose is to be sold for a massive profit. While standard shops offer a lower rate, a specialized **Item Maniac** (such as the billionaire in Undella Town’s villa) will purchase it for **300,000 Poké Dollars**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Minimal damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it provides no stat modifiers or passive recovery. It is strictly a "Playthrough Wealth" item used to fund expensive competitive resources like Vitamins, Battle Items, or TMs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It does not interact with any specific Pokémon abilities other than **Klutz**, which would prevent a Pokémon from "holding" it, though there is no benefit to doing so.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Extremely rare. It is typically found as a one-time treasure, most famously at the heart of the **Abyssal Ruins** in the Unova region. Reaching it requires navigating complex underwater currents and solving environment puzzles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief/Covet** mechanics, making it a finite and prized collectible for trainers looking to maximize their in-game currency.
