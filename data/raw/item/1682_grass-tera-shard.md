## Identity & Utility
**Grass Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized fragment of energy released from the Terastal phenomenon. It is a specialized resource used to alter a Pokémon's fundamental nature. It is a **Consumable Service Item** that is primarily collected through exploration and combat rather than traditional retail.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Modest**; though rarely sold in standard Poké Marts, this value represents its internal sale/buyback price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Grass Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali** to change a Pokémon’s Tera Type to **Grass**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta-Relevance.** In Generation IX competitive play (VGC and Smogon), changing a Pokémon's Tera Type is a core strategy. The Grass-type Tera is frequently used defensively by non-Grass types to gain immunity to "spore" and "powder" moves (like Spore or Rage Powder) and to gain resistances to Water, Ground, and Electric attacks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as a reward for completing **Tera Raid Battles** featuring Grass-type opponents. They are also found as shimmering "sparkle" pickups on the ground throughout the Paldea region, particularly in areas with lush vegetation, and can be produced in bulk via the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, Tera Shards are environmental or raid-based drops and are not compatible with the **Pickup** ability.
