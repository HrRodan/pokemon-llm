## Identity & Utility
**Gligar Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet/Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Gligar evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Resource** that cannot be bought at standard Poké Marts but is used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine). 
* **Cost:** 40 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource-tier; primarily used for LP exchange or crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a currency/ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it allows the player to create specific move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "Materials" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no direct impact on battle stats or mechanics. Its utility is strictly preparatory, enabling the acquisition of powerful moves for a competitive roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Distinction:** This item is **not** the "Razor Fang" and cannot be used to evolve Gligar into Gliscor. 
    * **Crafting:** It is specifically required to craft TMs such as **TM091 (Toxic Spikes)** and **TM181 (Knock Off)** (World Knowledge context).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Gligar or Gliscor. It is primarily found in the **Kitakami** region (Land of Kitakami).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is a guaranteed drop rather than a held item. Players typically farm this material by battling wild **Gligar** and **Gliscor**, often using "Encounter Power" sandwiches to increase spawn rates for efficient gathering.
* **Lore:** A sharp, sturdy fang shed by a Gligar. Its unique biological composition is processed by modern technology to encode complex move data into a digital format.
