## Identity & Utility
**TM211** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use items that can be consumed to teach a move and then re-crafted at a TM Machine using materials and League Points (LP). 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale via traditional Marts; requires **5,000 LP**, **3 Hitmontop Sweat**, and **3 Makuhita Sweat** to craft).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Upper Hand** (Move ID: 914) to a compatible Pokémon.
    * **Move Profile:** Upper Hand is a Physical Fighting-type move with 65 Base Power. It strikes first and causes the target to flinch, but only if the target was preparing to use a priority move (e.g., Extreme Speed, Sucker Punch, Fake Out).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **high-skill, niche utility item**. In VGC (Doubles) and Smogon formats, Upper Hand is used as a hard counter to "Priority Spam" archetypes. It is particularly effective against Pokémon like Paldean Arcanine or Dragonite (Extreme Speed) and Kingambit (Sucker Punch), though its success relies heavily on correct prediction.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a teaching tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM211 is primarily found within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy. It can be obtained as a ground pickup in the Savanna or Canyon Biomes, or rewarded by NPCs after certain battle milestones. Once found, it is added to the TM Machine's database for replication.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It must be crafted or found as a physical object in the overworld. Its existence highlights the advanced technology of the Blueberry Academy, focusing on tactical, specialized moves to counter high-level competitive strategies.
