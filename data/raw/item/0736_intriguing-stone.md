## Identity & Utility
**Intriguing Stone** is a **Plot-Advancement** item introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos/Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A curious, seemingly worthless stone that holds significant value to specific NPCs. It functions as a quest-sensitive exchange item rather than a standard held item or medicine. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Intriguing Stone acts as a trade-in token for high-value items. Its specific reward shifts based on the region:
    * **Kalos (X/Y):** Can be traded for a **Sun Stone** (used to evolve Pokémon like Helioptile into Heliolisk).
    * **Hoenn (OR/AS):** Can be traded to a man in Verdanturf Town for a **Pidgeotite**, the Mega Stone required for Pidgeot to undergo Mega Evolution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** The stone itself has **zero competitive utility**. However, its exchange value in *Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire* is critical, as it is the primary method to obtain **Pidgeotite**, which enables Mega Pidgeot (a Tier-relevant threat with the *No Guard* ability).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon; serves as a prerequisite "fetch quest" item to obtain evolution-inducing tools.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Pokémon X/Y:** Received from Tierno on Route 5.
    * **Pokémon OR/AS:** Found near the summit of Mt. Chimney after the Groudon/Kyogre encounter.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be generated by the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-time acquisition per playthrough.
* **Lore context:** The flavor text "eye of the beholder" is a meta-commentary on the item's value—it appears to be a common rock to the player, but to specialists like the stone collector in Hoenn, it is a rare artifact worth a priceless Mega Stone.
