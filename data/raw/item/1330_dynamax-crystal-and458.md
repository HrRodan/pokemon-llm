## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AND458** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item designed for use in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty Pokémon Den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While it has a defined internal price, it is not sold in Poké Marts and is typically distributed via serial codes or promotional events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, a pillar of light appears, initiating a **Max Raid Battle** with a specific Pokémon (referenced in internal data as `[VAR (0000)]`). Unlike standard Dens, this raid is guaranteed and specific to the crystal used. Once the raid is completed or the day ends, the effect expires.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld encounter generation and cannot be used in VGC, Smogon, or link battles. It is strictly a tool for acquiring rare Pokémon, often with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** These crystals are often used to bridge version gaps (e.g., allowing *Pokémon Sword* players to encounter *Shield* exclusives like Larvitar) or to provide early access to powerful Gigantamax-capable species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed through **special promotions** (such as the Dual Pack purchase bonus, retail serial codes, or magazine tie-ins like CoroCoro). It is not found through natural exploration or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held by wild Pokémon**. It is an artificial catalyst created to summon Dynamax energy to a specific coordinate in the Galar region.
* **Contextual Note:** "AND" series crystals are part of a naming convention for technical event triggers. While the flavor text is generic, these items are highly sought after by collectors and completionists for the unique "Max Raid" encounter they provide, which often features 4-5 Star difficulty rewards.
