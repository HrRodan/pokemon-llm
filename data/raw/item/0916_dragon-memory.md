## Identity & Utility
**Dragon Memory** is a **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A specialized electronic memory disc containing Dragon-type data. It is a **Held Item** designed specifically for the Pokémon Silvally. While it has a listed cost, it is technically a specialized piece of equipment that is usually acquired as part of a complete set rather than purchased individually.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Mid-range, though typically obtained via event/gift rather than a Mart).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the Pokémon’s base type changes to **Dragon** via its **RKS System** ability. Additionally, its signature move, **Multi-Attack**, becomes a Dragon-type move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard damage, no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche.** Dragon Silvally provides useful resistances to common Fire, Water, and Grass cores. However, it often faces stiff competition from other Dragon-types that possess more specialized abilities or higher base stats. In lower Smogon tiers, it is occasionally used as a bulky pivot or a "Defog" user that can hit back with a high-base-power (120) STAB Dragon-type Multi-Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item functions similarly to the **Plates** used by Arceus. It interacts exclusively with the **RKS System** ability. It is not a consumable and remains held throughout the battle; it cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by Silvally.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a gift from **Gladion** or a high-ranking NPC (such as at the Battle Tower in Galar) alongside the other 16 elemental memories. It represents the pinnacle of Aether Foundation technology in their attempt to create a "God-Slayer" (Type: Full).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a man-made technological artifact, it is restricted to specific story distributions or post-game rewards. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
