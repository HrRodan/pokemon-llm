## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal ERI1325** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it forces a specific Pokémon to appear as a Raid Boss until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically "Cheap," but as an event-exclusive item, this value is a placeholder for internal logic; it is not found in shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area) while this crystal is in their inventory, it activates a Max Raid Battle. The crystal is consumed upon the successful spawning of the raid.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching specific Pokémon or farming Max Raid rewards (like Exp. Candies and Dynamax Shards).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. Its primary purpose is to provide access to a specific Pokémon encounter, often one featuring a **Gigantamax** form or a **Hidden Ability** that might be difficult to find otherwise.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed via **serial codes** through special retail promotions (such as GameStop, Target, or GAME) or as bonuses for purchasing specific guides or expansion passes. They are not available through natural progression in *Pokémon Sword* or *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item tied to the player's Bag. 
* **Context:** The "ERI" series of crystals are part of a larger set of event triggers used to sustain engagement with the Max Raid feature outside of the standard rotating Wild Area News cycles.
