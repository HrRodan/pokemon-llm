## Identity & Utility
**Arrokuda Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** These scales are shedding remnants from the Arrokuda evolutionary line. As a specialized crafting component, they are stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag. They are **Consumable** during the crafting process but **Cannot** be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon from the menu.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common**). While they can be sold for a small amount of currency, their primary value lies in the "League Point" (LP) conversion or TM production.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for move-pool customization outside of battle. It has no effect on stats or mechanics during a competitive match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the TM Machine mechanic introduced in the Paldea region. It is used to craft moves that logically fit Arrokuda's theme (typically Water-type or physical biting/speed-based moves like **TM063 Psychic Fangs** or **TM110 Liquidation**).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after battling wild Arrokuda or its evolution, Barraskewda. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense of older generations, it is automatically awarded to the player upon **defeating or catching** wild **Arrokuda** or **Barraskewda**. It is frequently found in the rivers and seas of the Paldea region. Unlike items gathered via "Pickup," these are consistent rewards for engagement with specific species.
