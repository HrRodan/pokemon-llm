## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CNC3429** is a **Special Event Item (Dynamax Crystal)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a consumable event-trigger item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once used, it summons a specific Dynamax Pokémon for a Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Utility** item that **cannot** be purchased through standard in-game Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**; typically distributed via serial codes rather than sold).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it activates a red beam that initiates a specific Max Raid Battle. This particular crystal (CNC3429) is tied to a unique distribution encounter.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for overworld encounter generation and has no utility in Trainer vs. Trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Galar Wild Area. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific, often rare or event-exclusive, Pokémon encounter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event Exclusive**. Dynamax Crystals with specific alphanumeric codes (like CNC3429) were historically distributed through retail partnerships (e.g., GameStop, Target, or Pokémon Center) or as pre-order bonuses for the Sword & Shield Expansion Pass or specialized movie tie-ins.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly obtained through Mystery Gift serial codes or special distribution events.
