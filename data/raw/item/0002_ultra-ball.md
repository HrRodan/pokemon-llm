## Identity & Utility
**Ultra Ball** is a **Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation I** (though data originates from the Generation III engine).
* **Description:** An ultra-high-performance Poké Ball designed for superior capture rates. It serves as the final tier of the "standard" Poké Ball hierarchy (Standard < Great < Ultra). It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at most Marts once a trainer has reached a certain level of progression.
* **Cost:** 800 Poké Dollars (Mid-range; considered the standard late-game expense for serious trainers).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Attempts to capture a wild Pokémon with a **2.0× Catch Rate Modifier**. This makes it twice as effective as a standard Poké Ball and significantly more reliable than the Great Ball (1.5×) for high-level or rare encounters.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard Poké Balls generally cannot be used effectively with the move Fling, and if they are, they provide 0 base power).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no utility in Trainer-vs-Trainer battles, it is a **foundational tool for competitive team building**, used to secure high-statted Legendaries and rare wild Pokémon with specific Natures or Abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with the **Ball Guy** and **Cram-o-matic** mechanics in specific regions, and is a valid item for the **Pickup** ability reward table.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at Pokémon Marts and Department Stores once a player has earned roughly 5 to 6 Gym Badges. It is also a frequent find as a hidden item in late-game routes and dungeons.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically held by wild Pokémon. However, it is a common reward for Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability, usually appearing once the Pokémon reaches the mid-to-high level tiers (Level 41+). 
* **Lore Context:** Recognized globally as the "gold standard" for professional trainers before moving into specialized utility balls (like Dusk or Timer Balls). Its iconic black-and-yellow design signifies its high-performance status.
