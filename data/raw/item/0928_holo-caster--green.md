## Identity & Utility
**Holo-Caster (Green)** is an **Unused Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** A specialized communication device designed to receive and display hologram clips and facilitate video chats between users. While the flavor text describes a functional communication tool, it is categorized as an "unused" item within the game code. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In the retail versions of the games (specifically Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon), this item has no functional effect and is considered a placeholder or leftover data. The internal documentation lists it with a dummy effect string ("XXX new effect").
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown or held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item does not exist in the competitive ecosystem as it cannot be held or used in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with any Pokémon abilities. It is an internal asset primarily used for game data organization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable** through normal gameplay. While it appears in the internal item index of *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it was never distributed or placed in a location accessible to the player.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Context & Lore:** The Holo Caster was originally the primary communication and StreetPass interface in the Kalos region (Generation VI). The "Green" variant in the Generation VII files suggests a potential planned feature for Alola or a leftover asset from development that was never implemented, as the Rotom Dex fulfilled the primary communication and map roles in those titles.
