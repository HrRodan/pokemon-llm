## Identity & Utility
**TR54 (Toxic Spikes)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Toxic Spikes**. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs are consumed upon use, functioning similarly to classic TMs from earlier generations. 
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced/Specialty acquisition). In its home region of Galar, it is frequently exchanged for Watts rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Toxic Spikes** to a Pokémon. When used in battle, Toxic Spikes creates an entry hazard on the opponent's side of the field.
    * **One Layer:** Opposing Pokémon that switch in are inflicted with standard **Poison**.
    * **Two Layers:** Opposing Pokémon that switch in are inflicted with **Bad Poison** (Toxic).
    * **Exceptions:** Steel-types, Poison-types, and Flying-types/Levitate-users are immune to the effect. A grounded Poison-type switching in will remove the spikes from their side of the field.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Staple).** Toxic Spikes is a cornerstone of "Hazard Stacking" and "Stall" archetypes in 6v6 Singles (Smogon). It exerts immense pressure on defensive cores, forcing opponents to utilize Rapid Spin or Defog to avoid inevitable chip damage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is primarily compatible with Poison-types, Bug-types, and various "spiky" or aquatic Pokémon (e.g., Mareanie line, Cloyster, Omastar).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR54 is primarily obtained by defeating Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area. Its availability at Watt Traders rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon; it is exclusively a manufactured record of technical data. 
* **World Knowledge:** As a Technical Record, it represents more "advanced" or "volatile" techniques than standard TMs, explaining why the record breaks after a single use. In the Galar region ecosystem, these are considered high-value rewards for trainers participating in Dynamax-related activities.
