## Identity & Utility
**TM173 (Charge)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask DLC)**.
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a compatible Pokémon the move **Charge**. In Generation IX, TMs are single-use consumable items that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration in the Kitakami region or crafted using 800 LP and materials (3x Shinx Fang, 3x Mareep Wool).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Charge**. 
    * **Move Logic:** Charge is an Electric-type status move that raises the user's Special Defense by one stage. Additionally, if the user uses an Electric-type move on the next turn, the power of that move is doubled (2.0x multiplier).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** Charge is a **niche tactical move**. It is most effective on bulky Electric-type Pokémon like **Bellibolt** (synergizing with its *Electromorphosis* ability) or **Eelektross**. In VGC or Smogon formats, it is rarely used due to the "lost turn" of momentum, but it can be effective in lower-tier "nuke" strategies or Raids to maximize the damage of a single hit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a consumable teaching tool that is destroyed upon use unless the player crafts another copy.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically added to the TM catalog during the **The Teal Mask** expansion. The recipe is unlocked after finding the TM in the wild within the Kitakami region (notably near the **Crystal Pool** or southern areas of the map).
* **Wild Held Item:** TMs are never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft this specific TM are gathered from wild **Shinx, Luxio, Luxray, Mareep, Flaaffy,** and **Ampharos**.
