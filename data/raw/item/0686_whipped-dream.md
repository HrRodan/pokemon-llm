## Identity & Utility
**Whipped Dream** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A soft, sweet, and fluffy treat made of whipped and whirled cream. It is a specialized consumable held item specifically designed to trigger the evolution of a certain Pokémon species. While it has a defined price, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts and is typically treated as a specialty item.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; often obtained via Battle Points/BP in various games).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers the evolution of **Swirlix** into **Slurpuff**. The Swirlix must be holding the Whipped Dream while being traded to another player. The item is consumed upon the completion of the evolution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High). While not its intended use, it deals significant physical damage when used with the move Fling.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Preparatory. It has no passive benefit in battle; its primary competitive value lies in allowing players to obtain **Slurpuff**, which is utilized in lower tiers or specialized VGC teams for its *Unburden* ability or *Sticky Web* support.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the exclusive evolutionary catalyst for the Swirlix line. It does not affect any other Pokémon and does not trigger any specific "eat" mechanics despite its flavor description as a "treat."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Kalos), it is obtained via the **Battle Maison** for 32 BP or as a prize from the **Poké Ball Factory**. In later generations (Galar/Alola), it is often found in Battle Tower shops or as a reward from **Battle Cafés** after defeating a Cafe Master. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly limited to static locations, NPC gifts, or specialized exchange shops. 
* **Lore Context:** The item mirrors the dessert-based biology of the Swirlix line. Swirlix eats its weight in sugar to stay sticky and sweet; the Whipped Dream provides the concentrated dairy and sugar required to stabilize its transformation into the more complex Slurpuff.
