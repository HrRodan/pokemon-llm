## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CMA2657** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive consumable designed to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it summons a specific Dynamax Pokémon. The effect is temporary, lasting only until the end of the day (midnight) in which it was activated. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Functionally **Not for Sale**; this is a placeholder value as the item is distributed via Serial Codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the Watchtower Lair (located in the Ruins of Watchtower), the crystal is consumed to spawn a red beam of light. This allows the player to challenge a specific Pokémon—typically a Gigantamax-capable or rare encounter—in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The crystal itself has no tactical application in battle. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for providing guaranteed access to specific Pokémon that may possess Hidden Abilities or perfect Individual Values (IVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not trigger evolution or interact with Pokémon abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are **Event-Only** items. They were historically distributed via serial codes as part of promotional tie-ins, such as retail pre-orders (Amazon, GameStop) or magazine bonuses (CoroCoro). Once the serial code is redeemed via Mystery Gift, the item appears in the player's "Other Items" pocket.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item cannot be found on wild Pokémon and is strictly acquired through external distributions or special promotional events.
