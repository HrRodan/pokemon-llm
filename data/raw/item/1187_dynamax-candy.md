## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Candy** is a **Vitamin** (Growth Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable candy packed with concentrated energy. When fed to a Pokémon, it raises its Dynamax Level by one stage (up to a maximum of 10). It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be purchased through traditional retail means.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired exclusively through gameplay rewards).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases a single Pokémon's **Dynamax Level** by 1. Each level increases the amount of HP a Pokémon gains when it Dynamaxes in battle. At Dynamax Level 0, a Pokémon's HP increases by 1.5x; at the maximum Dynamax Level 10, the Pokémon’s HP is doubled (2.0x) while in Dynamax form.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Mandatory Preparation.** In the Generation VIII competitive landscape (VGC and Smogon), maximizing the Dynamax Level of every team member is essential. The difference between 1.5x and 2.0x HP is often the deciding factor in surviving powerful Max Moves or triggering a Held Item like a Weakness Policy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike Rare Candies or Exp. Candies, this item does not affect a Pokémon's actual level or stats outside of the Dynamax transformation. It has no effect on Zacian, Zamazenta, or Eternatus, as they are incapable of Dynamaxing.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Candies are primarily obtained as rewards for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** in the Wild Area, Isle of Armor, or Crown Tundra. They are also occasionally granted by NPCs or found as hidden items in areas with high Power Spot activity.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly tied to participating in the Max Raid ecosystem, reinforcing the lore that these candies are crystallized forms of Galar's unique Dynamax energy (Galar Particles).
