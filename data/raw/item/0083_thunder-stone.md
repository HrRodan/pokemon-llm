## Identity & Utility
**Thunder Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** A peculiar stone characterized by a distinct thunderbolt pattern. It is a **Consumable** item used to trigger permanent physiological changes (evolution) in specific Electric-type Pokémon species. It can be used directly from the bag on a party member and is consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Standard price** for evolutionary stones in most regional Department Stores).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When applied to specific Pokémon, it triggers an immediate evolution, regardless of the Pokémon's current level. 
    * **Evolves:** 
        * **Pikachu** into **Raichu** (Kantonian or Alolan depending on the region).
        * **Eevee** into **Jolteon**.
        * **Eelektrik** into **Eelektross**.
        * **Charjabug** into **Vikavolt** (since Gen VIII).
        * **Magneton** into **Magnezone** (since Gen VIII, replacing the "special magnetic field" requirement).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. Evolution stones have no utility as held items in competitive play. Their value is strictly preparatory, used to obtain fully evolved Pokémon like Jolteon or Vikavolt for team building.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is part of the "Elemental Stone" group. While it is not a held item for evolution (like a Protector), it is a mandatory catalyst for certain species that cannot evolve through leveling alone.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically available for purchase at major Department Stores (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove). In the Sinnoh region, it is frequently found by players exploring the **Underground**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. However, it can be acquired via the **Pickup** ability, usually by high-level Pokémon (typically Level 50+ or 70+ depending on the specific game version).
* **Lore context:** The stone represents a concentrated mass of electrical energy. It is often found in areas associated with lightning or power plants.
