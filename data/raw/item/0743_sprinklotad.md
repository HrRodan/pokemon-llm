## Identity & Utility
**Sprinklotad** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized watering can shaped like the Pokémon Lotad. It is a Key Item used in the overworld to promote the healthy growth of Berries planted in soft soil. It cannot be sold or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a patch of soft soil containing a planted Berry, it waters the plant. Regular watering prevents the soil from drying out, which is necessary to maximize the yield of Berries per harvest and ensure the plant progresses through its growth stages efficiently.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists strictly for overworld Berry cultivation mechanics and has no application in trainer battles or VGC/Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is the Generation VI equivalent of the SquirtBottle (Gen II), Wailmer Pail (Gen III), and Sprayduck (Gen IV).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X & Y*, the Sprinklotad is obtained at the **Berry Fields** on Route 7. It is given to the player by the daughter of the Berry Field's owner after they learn the basics of Berry farming.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique tool provided to the player to facilitate the agricultural sub-game within the Kalos region. Unlike previous watering cans modeled after Wailmer or Psyduck, this version pays homage to the Water/Grass-type Lotad, fitting the theme of botanical care.
