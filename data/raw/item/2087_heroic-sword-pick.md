## Identity & Utility
**Heroic-Sword Pick** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** An aesthetic skewer used during the sandwich-making process at a Picnic. It serves as the final component to secure ingredients in place. While functionally similar to basic picks, its heroic sword design serves as a premium cosmetic choice for trainers. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought at specialty shops.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Premium**; significantly more expensive than basic picks like the Red or Blue variants).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the end of the sandwich-making minigame, it completes the sandwich, triggering the activation of **Meal Powers**. These powers provide various buffs, including increased Shiny encounter rates (Sparkling Power), boosted experience points (Exp. Point Power), or faster Egg discovery (Egg Power).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the pick has no combat stats, it is essential for the sandwich mechanic used by competitive players to quickly breed perfect-IV Pokémon (via Egg Power) or hunt for Shiny Pokémon with specific Marks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly tied to the **Picnic** sub-system and is consumed upon the successful creation of a sandwich.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at specialty culinary shops within the Paldea region, specifically **Every Wich Way** and **Sure Cans** locations in major hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike held items that can be gathered via the **Pickup** ability, this is a commercial goods item intended for trainer-led activities.
* **World Context:** In the Paldean culture, sandwich-making is a central social activity. The Heroic-Sword Pick is themed after the imagery of legendary heroes, appealing to trainers who want their picnic presentation to reflect a sense of adventure and prestige.
