## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (UMA5191)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable event item that triggers a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon remains available to challenge until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard in-game marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal Value**). While it has a technical cost in the code, it is essentially priceless as it is distributed via special serial codes or promotional events rather than retail.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is instantly triggered. This allows the player to encounter a specific Pokémon (dictated by the crystal's unique ID) in a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the overworld mechanic of spawning rare or event-exclusive Max Raid encounters. It provides no benefit in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not directly evolve Pokémon. However, it is used to obtain Pokémon that may possess the Gigantamax Factor, Hidden Abilities, or high IV yields typical of Max Raid Bosses.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively through **special promotions** (such as pre-order bonuses, retail distributions like GameStop/EB Games, or movie tie-ins). This specific variant (UMA5191) is part of a series of crystals designed to give players early access to rare Pokémon or version-exclusives.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability. It is tied to the player's inventory as a "Special Item" intended to facilitate a unique encounter.
* **Context:** The Watchtower Lair remains inactive and "cold" during normal gameplay; Dynamax Crystals are the only method to activate this specific den, making them highly sought after for completionists or those looking for specific Pokémon early in a playthrough.
