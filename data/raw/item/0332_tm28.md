## Identity & Utility
**TM28** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation I** (though cataloged here under Generation III data).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. While traditionally associated with the move **Dig**, in certain iterations (such as *Pokémon: Let's Go*), it teaches **Tri Attack**. It is a **Consumable** (in most early and very recent games) or **Infinite Use** item (Gens V-VII) that is significantly expensive to purchase.
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Expensive**). This high price point usually reflects its status as a high-utility move or a luxury purchase in later-game Department Stores.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Dig (Standard):** A two-turn Ground-type physical move. The user hides underground on turn one (becoming semi-invulnerable to most attacks) and strikes on turn two. 
    * **Tri Attack (Variant):** In *Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee*, this TM teaches a Normal-type move that has a 20% chance to either burn, freeze, or paralyze the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines typically cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Dig:** Generally considered **Niche/Low-tier** in competitive play (Smogon/VGC) because the semi-invulnerable turn allows the opponent to switch to a Flying-type or a Pokémon with Levitate. However, it is a **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Staple** for its coverage and utility.
        * **Tri Attack:** A solid special attacking move for Normal-types, valued for its high probability of inflicting a debilitating status condition.
* **Overworld Utility:** In many generations, if a Pokémon knows Dig (via TM28), it can be used to instantly teleport the player to the entrance of a cave or dungeon, acting as an "Escape Rope."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** TM28 is historically found in locations associated with burrowing or technology. It is often found in the **National Park (Johto)**, **Route 114 (Hoenn)**, or purchasable at high-end venues like the **Celadon or Veilstone Department Stores**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it must be found as a localized item ball or purchased from specialty TMs shops.
* **Compatibility:** Highly accessible to a wide variety of Pokémon, especially Ground-types, Normal-types, and those with claws or drilling appendages.
