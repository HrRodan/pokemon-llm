## Identity & Utility
**TR19 (Tri Attack)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that imparts the move **Tri Attack** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike the infinite-use TMs of the same generation, TRs are **consumable** and break after a single application.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate value; primarily acquired via Watts in the Galar Wild Area).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Tri Attack**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Special Normal-type attack with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 20% chance to inflict either a Burn, Paralysis, or Freeze on the target (roughly a 6.67% chance for each status).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage for a projectile, though usually a waste of a move-teaching resource).
    * **Competitive Use:** Tri Attack is a signature coverage or STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for Special attackers. It is particularly devastating on Pokémon with the **Serene Grace** ability (like Togekiss or Dunsparce), which doubles the secondary effect chance to 40%, making it a potent tool for fishing for status conditions in VGC or Smogon formats. It is also the premier STAB move for **Porygon-Z**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR19 is most commonly obtained by defeating Normal-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a variable amount of Watts (typically around 3,000 W).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. This item is an artificial data record created to facilitate rapid move learning in the Galar region. Its high cost reflects the complexity of the "three-beam" energy signature required to execute Tri Attack.
