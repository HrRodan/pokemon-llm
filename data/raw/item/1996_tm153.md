## Identity & Utility
**TM153 (Blast Burn)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)** as part of the expanded TM list, specifically associated with the **Indigo Disk** expansion.
* **Description:** A move-teaching disc that provides the move **Blast Burn** to compatible Pokémon. As a modern TM, it is a single-use consumable in Generation IX, though it can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Scarlet & Violet*, TMs are not purchased with currency but are crafted at the TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Blast Burn** to a compatible Pokémon (typically Fire-type Starter Pokémon in their final evolution).
    * **Move Profile:** Blast Burn is a Fire-type Special move with **150 Power** and **90% Accuracy**.
    * **Drawback:** If the move hits, the user must recharge on the next turn, making them unable to move, swap, or use items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche/Low-Tier**. While it possesses immense raw power, the "recharge turn" is a significant liability in competitive play (Smogon/VGC), as it allows the opponent a free turn to set up or knock out the user. It is occasionally seen as a "last-resort" nuke on Special-attacking Fire starters like Charizard or Typhlosion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This TM is exclusively learnable by **Fire-type Starter Pokémon** (e.g., Charizard, Blaziken, Skeledirge, Incineroar) once they have reached their final evolutionary stage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically added in the **Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk)**. It is typically obtained by defeating specific trainers in the Terarium, found as a collectible item in the environment, or unlocked at the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** As a high-tier "Ultimate Move," crafting it requires a significant amount of League Points (LP) and rare materials gathered from Fire-type Pokémon found within the Terarium.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial data disc created by Silph Co. or the Blueberry Academy technical staff.
