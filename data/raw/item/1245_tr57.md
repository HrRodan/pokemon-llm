## Identity & Utility
**TR57 (Poison Jab)** is a **Technical Record (Move-Teaching Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc that teaches the move **Poison Jab** to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike TMs in Generation VIII, TRs (Technical Records) break after one use, functioning similarly to the classic TM system from earlier generations. 
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Standard). Note: In Galar, these are primarily traded for **Watts** at Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Poison Jab**. This is a Physical Poison-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 30% chance to inflict the **Poison** status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage for a Fling-based strategy, though the item is consumed upon use regardless).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Poison Jab is the premier physical Poison-type coverage move. It is frequently used by physical attackers (such as Garchomp, Zacian-C, or Urshifu) to check Fairy-types, which would otherwise resist their primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed immediately upon successful teaching.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR57 can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 3,000–5,000 Watts (price fluctuates by trader). It is also a common reward for defeating **Poison-type Pokémon** in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial data storage device manufactured for training purposes. In the Galar region’s lore, TRs represent more powerful or "technical" moves that require the consumption of the record to be mastered.
