## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (hya3845)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While it has a technical cost of 20, it is functionally a promotional item typically distributed via serial codes or special events rather than retail purchase.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty Den in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins), it causes a specific Pokémon—indicated by the crystal's ID—to appear as a Dynamax encounter. This allows players to challenge a Max Raid Battle on command, regardless of the current weather or standard Den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in active Pokémon battles. Its value is entirely logistical, providing access to specific Pokémon that may have high IVs, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax factors necessary for building competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional item (often via retail pre-order bonuses or "Mystery Gift" serial codes). Once the crystal is used and the raid is successfully cleared or the day ends, the item is consumed and removed from the inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial "key" to a Dynamax encounter, typically linked to specific distribution campaigns (the "HYA" prefix in the internal name often corresponds to specific Pokémon lines, such as the Hydreigon or Jangmo-o event distributions).
