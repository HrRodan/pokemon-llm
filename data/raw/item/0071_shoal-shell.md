## Identity & Utility
**Shoal-shell** is a **Collectibles** item introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn Region)**.
* **Description:** A pretty, iridescent seashell found deep within the Shoal Cave. It functions primarily as a crafting material and a tradeable collectible. It is a **Consumable (Material)** item that can technically be bought/sold, though its value lies in specific exchanges rather than standard retail.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Material Value**). While its base shop price is low, flavor text indicates specialized "Item Maniac" NPCs will purchase it for a significantly higher price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its debut region (Hoenn), it is used as a currency for item crafting. By giving **four Shoal Shells** and **four Shoal Salts** to the old man in Shoal Cave, the player receives a **Shell Bell** (a competitive held item that restores HP based on damage dealt).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard damage, no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It provides no benefit when held in battle. Its utility is strictly restricted to the overworld economy and crafting the Shell Bell.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is tide-dependent. It can only be collected during **low tide** in Shoal Cave (9:00 AM – 3:00 PM and 9:00 PM – 3:00 AM). It does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively found on the ground in the lower, drained levels of **Shoal Cave** during low tide. In later generations (like Gen V), it serves as a high-value vendor trash item to be sold to the Ore Maniac in Icirrus City or similar NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly held by wild Pokémon; it must be gathered manually from the environment. It is a key part of the Hoenn region's environmental puzzle mechanics, paired with Shoal Salt to reward players for visiting the cave at different times of the day.
