## Identity & Utility
**Pepper** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A spicy, pungent seasoning used as a condiment during the Picnic mechanic in the Paldea region. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** used to craft sandwiches that grant various Meal Powers. It can be purchased in bulk from specific grocery vendors.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Highly Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich recipe, Pepper contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. It primarily provides points toward **Humungo Power**, **Item Drop Power**, and **Raid Power**. It is categorized as a seasoning rather than a physical filling (like Ham or Lettuce).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Sandwich ingredients cannot be held by Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Metagame Utility.** While Pepper has no direct effect in a Pokémon battle, it is essential for the "pre-game" competitive loop. It is used in specific recipes to increase the encounter rate of specific types or to improve the rewards from Tera Raid Battles, facilitating the acquisition of Tera Shards and Herba Mystica.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Picnic/Sandwich-making minigame**. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz as it cannot be held.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at food-specific retailers across the Paldea region. It is a staple item found at **Sure Cans**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Delibird Presents** (in certain branches).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon; it is strictly a commercially available food product for trainers. Its presence in the game reflects the Paldean culture's emphasis on culinary exploration and the "Picnic" lifestyle.
