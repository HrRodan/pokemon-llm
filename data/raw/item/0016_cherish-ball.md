## Identity & Utility
**Cherish Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A distinct, vibrant red Poké Ball with black accents, described as being crafted to commemorate a special occasion. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot be bought** or obtained through normal gameplay; it is strictly an event-only item.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Special Acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In terms of raw mechanics, it attempts to catch a wild Pokémon with a **1× Catch Rate modifier** (identical to a standard Poké Ball). However, because the item is not distributed to players to hold, this effect is largely internal to the game's code.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung as it is not naturally obtainable as a held item).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no tactical advantage, the Cherish Ball serves as a **"Special Event Marker."** In competitive formats, its presence confirms the Pokémon was obtained via a Mystery Gift distribution. Historically, this could reveal information about a Pokémon's moveset, as some event Pokémon come with exclusive moves (e.g., *Extreme Speed* Entei or *V-create* Victini).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The Cherish Ball has a unique inheritance property: unlike other Poké Balls, **it cannot be passed down through breeding**. Offspring of a Pokémon in a Cherish Ball will always hatch in a standard Poké Ball.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Not available** in any Poké Mart or as a field item. It is exclusively used by The Pokémon Company and Game Freak for **Distribution Events**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is the signature housing for Mythical Pokémon and special commemorative distributions (such as Shiny Legendaries or tournament-winner replicas). Its presence in a trainer's party is a symbol of participation in a real-world Pokémon event.
