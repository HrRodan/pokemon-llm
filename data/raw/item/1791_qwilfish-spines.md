## Identity & Utility
**Qwilfish Spines** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item represents biological material shed by or harvested from the Qwilfish evolutionary line. As a dedicated crafting component, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag and cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon. It is a **consumable crafting resource** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Low-value commodity; primarily used for its LP exchange value or crafting utility rather than direct profit).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at any Pokémon Center in the Paldea region. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the spines themselves have no competitive utility, they are essential for obtaining high-tier TMs, which are critical for building competitive movepools in the Generation IX meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone and does not trigger any evolutionary changes. It is strictly a resource for the Technical Machine crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild **Qwilfish** (including Hisuian Qwilfish) or **Overqwil** in the wild or via Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense (it does not occupy a held item slot on a wild Pokémon) but is instead dropped as a reward upon the Pokémon's defeat. It is frequently farmed by players using the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature in areas where Qwilfish are abundant, such as the seas of Paldea or the waters of the Terarium.
