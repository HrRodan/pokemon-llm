## Identity & Utility
**TM214 (Sludge Bomb)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* expansion for *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach the move **Sludge Bomb** to compatible Pokémon. As a Generation IX TM, it is a single-use consumable that can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). In *Scarlet and Violet*, it must be crafted at a TM Machine using **10,000 LP** and specific Pokémon materials (Croagunk Sweat x5, Grimer Toxin x3, Qwilfish Spines x3).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sludge Bomb**. 
    * **Move Stats:** Power: 90 | Accuracy: 100% | Type: Poison | Category: Special.
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to inflict the **Poison** status condition on the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier / Staple.** Sludge Bomb is the premier Special Poison-type move for competitive play. It is widely used by Special Attackers (like Glimmora, Amoonguss, or Iron Moth) to threaten Fairy-type and Grass-type Pokémon. The 30% poison chance is a significant factor in breaking down defensive walls.
