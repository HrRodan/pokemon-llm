## Identity & Utility
**Shell Bell** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized recovery tool to be held by a Pokémon. Unlike passive recovery items, the Shell Bell converts offensive pressure into sustain, restoring a portion of the holder's HP whenever they successfully inflict damage on an opponent. It is a **Held (Active)** item that can be bought for a moderate price in specific late-game locations or Battle Facilities.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive / Standard Competitive Tier**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Whenever the holder deals direct damage to a target, it recovers HP equal to **1/8th (12.5%)** of the damage inflicted. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** While often overshadowed by **Leftovers** (which provides guaranteed 1/16th HP recovery every turn), the Shell Bell is a **Niche/Semi-Competitive** choice. It is most effective on "glass cannon" attackers with massive damage output who can heal more from a single hit than they would from a fixed turn-based recovery. 
    * **Specific Synergies:** It is the cornerstone of the **Level 1 Aron "F.E.A.R." strategy**, where a Level 1 Aron uses *Endeavor* to drop the opponent to 1 HP; the Shell Bell then heals Aron back to full HP, resetting its *Sturdy* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a performance-enhancing held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally crafted in the **Shoal Cave** of the Hoenn region using Shoal Salts and Shoal Shells. In subsequent generations, it is typically found as a hidden item in coastal areas or purchased via Battle Points (BP) in various Battle Towers/Frontiers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly found on wild Pokémon (0 listed in current data), making it a rare find usually limited to one or two per playthrough or as a high-cost reward from specialized shops. It is often a reward for completing specific Pokédex milestones or side-quests.
