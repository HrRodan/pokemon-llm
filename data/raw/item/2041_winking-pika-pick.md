## Identity & Utility
**Winking Pika Pick** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
*   **Description:** A decorative food pick featuring a winking Pikachu design. It is used during the sandwich-making minigame at picnics to secure the ingredients in place. It is a **Consumable** utility item that can be purchased in bulk.
*   **Cost:** 1,200 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** During the sandwich-making process at a Picnic, this pick is used as the final step to hold the sandwich together. While the pick itself is primarily cosmetic, using a pick is mandatory to complete a sandwich and activate **Meal Powers** (such as Sparkling Power, Title Power, or Egg Power).
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle or used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no application in VGC or Smogon competitive formats as it cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle. Its utility is strictly limited to overworld sandwich crafting for shiny hunting, breeding, and raid preparations.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Picnic mechanic exclusive to the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Primarily purchased at **Every Wich Way** specialty stores located in major cities across the Paldea region (e.g., Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, Levincia).
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, these are consumer goods manufactured for trainers and are not found in the wild via the **Pickup** ability.
