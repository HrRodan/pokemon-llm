## Identity & Utility
**AuroraTicket** is an **Event Item (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen, and Emerald).
* **Description:** A beautiful, glowing ticket required to board the ferry to a remote location. It functions as a permanent pass that grants the player passage to **Birth Island**. As a Key Item, it cannot be discarded, traded, or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired exclusively through special distributions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When in the player's possession, the ticket activates a unique dialogue option at the port (Vermilion City in Kanto or Lilycove City in Hoenn). It allows the player to travel to **Birth Island**, a secluded island shaped like a triangle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This is a story-progression item used to encounter a Mythical Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item is the sole trigger for the **Birth Island Puzzle**. By interacting with a black triangle on the island and following a specific movement sequence, the player triggers a battle with the Mythical Pokémon **Deoxys**. In Generation III, Deoxys’s form (Normal, Attack, Defense, or Speed) is determined by which game version the player is using.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, this item was distributed via **Mystery Gift** at real-world Nintendo events, retail locations (such as Toys "R" Us), or the Pokémon Center during the mid-2000s. It was delivered to the player's save file as a **Wonder Card**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-per-save-file item granted by an NPC (the delivery man) after the event data is received.
* **Lore context:** The Aurora Ticket is one of the "big three" event items of the Hoenn/Kanto era, alongside the MysticTicket (Lugia/Ho-Oh) and the Old Sea Map (Mew). It represents the first method players had to legitimately obtain Deoxys in the original Game Boy Advance titles.
