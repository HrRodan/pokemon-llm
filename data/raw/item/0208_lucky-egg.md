## Identity & Utility
**Lucky Egg** is a **Training** item introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** An egg filled with happiness that earns the holder extra Experience Points in battle. It is a **Held** item that is primarily used to accelerate Pokémon growth and team leveling. While it has a defined cost in the data, it is rarely available in standard Poké Marts and is considered a high-value rarity.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive/Rare).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Pokémon, it increases all Experience Points (Exp) gained in battle by **50% (1.5x multiplier)**. This applies to both participating in battle and experience shared via the Exp. Share (in modern generations).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), Pokémon are set to a fixed level (usually 50 or 100), rendering the Lucky Egg's effect useless.
    * **Playthrough Utility:** **Essential Staple.** It is the most sought-after item for post-game grinding, completing the Pokédex, and preparing teams for high-level NPC challenges like the Battle Tower or Elite Four rematches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. However, it is a primary target for the moves **Thief**, **Covet**, and the ability **Frisk** when farming wild Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a single-copy gift from key NPCs (such as Professor Kukui or at the Treasure Ivy) or as a rare reward in Battle Facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously difficult to farm. It can be found held by wild **Chansey**, **Blissey**, **Happiny**, and **Pelipper**. 
    * *Farming Strategy:* Because of the low encounter rate of Chansey and the low hold rate of the item (typically 5%), players often use a lead Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase hold chances, combined with a **Frisk/Thief** user to identify and steal the egg.
