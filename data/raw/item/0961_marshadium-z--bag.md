## Identity & Utility
**Marshadium Z (Bag Item)** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** It is a special crystal that converts Z-Power to allow the Pokémon **Marshadow** to upgrade its signature move. As a Bag Item entry, it functions as a Key Item that signifies the player has unlocked the capability to use this specific Z-Crystal. It **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Marshadow that knows the move **Spectral Thief**, this crystal allows the move to be upgraded to the exclusive Z-Move: **Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike**. 
    * **Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike:** A Physical Ghost-type move with a massive **195 Base Power**. It is unique because Marshadow steals the target's stat boosts *before* dealing damage, making it an incredibly potent offensive tool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Niche/Ubers).** Marshadow is a restricted Mythical Pokémon. In formats where it is legal (like Smogon Ubers or specific VGC seasons), Marshadium Z is a premier item choice. It provides Marshadow with a "one-button" nuke that punishes setup sweepers by stealing their buffs before the hit connects.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to **Marshadow**. It does not trigger evolution. It is immune to moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, and cannot be removed from Marshadow during battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, the Marshadium Z is obtained from a man in the **Tide Song Hotel** in Heahea City, provided the player has a Marshadow in their party. In the original *Sun and Moon*, it was distributed via a limited-time mystery gift event alongside Marshadow.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind item tied to the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow.
* **Context:** This specific "bag" entry in the data represents the player's possession of the Z-Crystal, which allows the "Held Item" version to be equipped to the Pokémon. In the Alola games, Z-Crystals do not take up space in the standard item bag and are kept in a dedicated Z-Crystal case.
