## Identity & Utility
**Berry Pots** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*).
* **Description:** A portable gardening kit consisting of four containers filled with soil. It allows trainers to cultivate, water, and harvest Berries while traveling, removing the need to return to fixed soil patches found in other regions. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Provides the player with four portable slots for planting Berries. This system replaces the stationary Berry patches found in other games. Players must plant a Berry, water it using the SquirtBottle, and wait for the growth cycles to complete (real-time) to harvest multiple Berries.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld, though it is the primary method for farming competitive-use Berries (such as the Sitrus, Lum, or Type-resist Berries) within the Johto region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the Berry Pots do not evolve Pokémon directly, they are the primary source for acquiring Berries that trigger specific evolutions (e.g., leveling up with high friendship boosted by certain Berries) or Berries that alter stats (EV-reducing Berries like Pomeg or Kelpsy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a mandatory story item in *Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver*. It is gifted to the player by a man in the **Goldenrod City Flower Shop** after the player has dealt with the Sudowoodo on Route 36.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike the Sinnoh or Hoenn regions, which feature fertile soil patches on various routes, the Johto region lacks natural soil patches, making the Berry Pots the player's exclusive method for Berry cultivation in that generation.
