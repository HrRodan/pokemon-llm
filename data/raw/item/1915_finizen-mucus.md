## Identity & Utility
**Finizen Mucus** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** This is a biological material dropped by members of the Finizen evolutionary line. It is a specialized crafting ingredient primarily used at the Technical Machine (TM) Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable/Material** item that is not typically bought in shops but can be sold for a small amount of currency or League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**; often converted to LP for crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory component for crafting specific Technical Machines. In Pokémon Scarlet and Violet, players must combine Finizen Mucus with League Points to "print" TMs to teach moves to their Pokémon. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in a competitive battle environment (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held by a Pokémon to provide a buff. Its value lies entirely in the "preparation" phase of competitive play (obtaining the necessary movesets).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for Pokémon evolution. It is consumed entirely upon the creation of a TM. Common TMs requiring this material often include water-type or utility moves associated with Finizen's move pool (e.g., **Flip Turn**, **Chilling Water**, or **Rain Dance**).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Finizen** or **Palafin** in the Paldean seas. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is added to the "TM Materials" pocket of the bag automatically upon the conclusion of a battle with the Finizen line. It is effectively gathered through manual hunting or the **Let's Go!** (Auto-battle) feature.
* **Context:** The mucus is described as being secreted by the Pokémon to keep its skin moist and protected, reflecting Finizen's dolphin-like physiology and its need for hydration even when temporarily out of water.
