## Identity & Utility
**Horsea Candy** is a **Species-specific Consumable** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let’s Go, Pikachu!* and *Let’s Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutrient-dense candy tailored for the Horsea evolutionary line. It is a consumable medicine used in the overworld to permanently enhance a Pokémon's capabilities. While it can be sold, it is primarily an earned resource rather than a store-bought item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal sell value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Horsea line (**Horsea, Seadra, or Kingdra**), it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. These points contribute to **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a stat-growth system unique to the *Let's Go* series that allows each stat to be boosted by up to 200 points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon in battle and has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** It is non-existent in standard VGC or Smogon competitive play. However, it is mandatory for optimizing Pokémon for **Master Trainer** battles within the *Let's Go* titles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item specifically interacts with the Horsea family. Unlike generic candies (Quick Candy, Tough Candy), there is no level requirement to use Species Candy, making it the most efficient way to max out a Pokémon's AVs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching Horsea in the wild (especially via **Catch Combos**) or by transferring caught Horsea, Seadra, or Kingdra to **Professor Oak** in exchange for rewards. It can also be found by walking with a Pokémon in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is gathered through the **Catching/Transfer mechanic** rather than the Pickup ability or traditional looting.
* **Lore context:** Unlike Rare Candies which increase experience/level, Species Candies represent specialized training and the "essence" of a specific Pokémon lineage, allowing a Pokémon to reach its maximum physical and special potential regardless of its level.
