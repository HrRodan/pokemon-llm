## Identity & Utility
**Focus Sash** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized headband that grants the holder a "safety net" against overwhelming force. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is triggered only when the holder is at maximum health. While it can be bought in some late-game shops, it is often treated as a high-value prize or Battle Point (BP) reward.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Expensive; often implies acquisition via specialized battle facilities).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder has **100% of its HP**, any single attack that would otherwise knock it out will instead leave the Pokémon with **1 HP**. Once triggered, the Focus Sash is **consumed** and disappears (except in competitive link battles or battle facilities where items are restored afterward).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally a poor choice for the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **S-Tier Competitive Staple.** It is essential for "Glass Cannons" (Pokémon with high offense but very low defense like Weavile, Alakazam, or Pheromosa) and dedicated "Leads" to ensure they can set up entry hazards like Stealth Rock or Tailwind before fainting.
    * **Specific Negations:** It does not protect against indirect damage such as Sandstorm, Hail, Poison, Burn, or Entry Hazards (which break the Sash by reducing HP below 100%). It also does not protect against the delayed damage of *Future Sight* or *Doom Desire*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Functionally identical to the **Sturdy** ability. It allows Pokémon with the **Unburden** ability to double their Speed immediately upon the Sash being consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game locations, such as the **Battle Frontier**, **Battle Subway**, or **Battle Maison**. In some regions, it is gifted by NPCs for showing them a Pokémon of a certain level or reaching a specific milestone.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically found on wild Pokémon**, making it a rare resource in standard playthroughs. It is most effectively gathered through specialized shops rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
* **Strategic Context:** In a Nuzlocke or casual playthrough, the Focus Sash is a "one-time insurance policy" for a crucial boss fight. In competitive VGC or Smogon formats, it is one of the most used items to counteract "one-shot" (OHKO) strategies.
