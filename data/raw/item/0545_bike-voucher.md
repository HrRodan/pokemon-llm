## Identity & Utility
**Bike Voucher** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (and featured prominently in its Generation III remakes, FireRed and LeafGreen).
* **Description:** A physical coupon that entitles the bearer to one free bicycle. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. Its sole purpose is to serve as a currency substitute for an otherwise prohibitively expensive traversal tool.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In the context of the game's economy, it is used to bypass the **1,000,000 Poké Dollar** price tag of the Bicycle, which exceeds the player's maximum wallet capacity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When presented to the manager of the **Miracle Cycle** shop in Cerulean City, the voucher is consumed and replaced with a **Bicycle** in the player's Key Items pocket. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld only, specifically designed for faster traversal and bypassing the cycling road guards.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interaction with Pokémon evolution or abilities. It functions strictly as a quest-flag item to unlock the game's primary speed-enhancement mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Kanto-based games (Generation I and III), the voucher is obtained as a gift from the **Chairman of the Pokémon Fan Club** in Vermilion City after the player listens to him talk at length about his favorite Pokémon (Rapidash or Fearow).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time plot item given by an NPC.
* **Lore Context:** The Bike Voucher represents the disconnect between the exorbitant "tourist prices" of the Cerulean Bike Shop and the accessibility provided through social networking within the Pokémon world's hobbyist circles (The Fan Club). It is a mandatory item for players who wish to access the **Cycling Road (Route 17)**.
