## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PUP3045** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Consumable) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A specific event-driven item designed to be used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. Upon activation, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon that persists until midnight of the day it is used. It is a **Consumable** item that technically has a cost associated with it in the data, but is functionally an event-exclusive key item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**; traditionally obtained via serial code distributions rather than in-game marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the empty Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area with this item in their inventory, a pillar of light is triggered. This initiates a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (in this case, the **PUP3045** crystal typically summons **Larvitar** in *Pokémon Sword* or **Jangmo-o** in *Pokémon Shield*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is used exclusively in the overworld to facilitate an encounter and has no application in competitive Pokémon battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon, but it is the primary method for obtaining specific version-exclusive or rare species early in a playthrough via the Max Raid mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a **Pre-order Bonus** via Serial Code (specifically for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack*). It is not available through normal gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to encourage early-purchase or bundle-purchase participation.
* **World Knowledge Context:** Dynamax Crystals like PUP3045 are unique because they allow players to encounter "Version Opposite" Pokémon (e.g., getting the Shield-exclusive Larvitar in Sword). They are one-time-use items; if the player fails the raid, they can re-attempt it until the end of the calendar day, at which point the pillar of light disappears.
