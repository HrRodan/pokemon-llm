## Identity & Utility
**Marmalade** is a **Sandwich Ingredient (Condiment)** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A sweet and tangy citrus-based spread used exclusively in the Picnic mechanic to create sandwiches. It is a consumable crafting component used to manipulate Meal Powers. 
* **Cost:** 260 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a condiment in a sandwich, Marmalade adds specific flavors and Meal Power values. It primarily provides **Sweet** and **Sour** flavor profiles.
* **Meal Power Contributions (Standard):**
    * **Item Drop Power:** Significantly boosts the likelihood of obtaining materials from wild Pokémon.
    * **Catching Power:** Provides a secondary boost to catch rates.
    * **Type Association:** Often used in recipes targeting **Psychic**, **Fire**, or **Fighting** types (varying by recipe composition).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the **Overworld/Picnic** system for Shiny hunting, Egg power, or Raid power optimization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at culinary retail outlets across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Deli Cioso**, **Aquiesta Supermarket**, and **Sure Cans** once the player has obtained a sufficient number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or traditional held items, this is a processed human food item found only in shops or as rewards from NPC activities (like the Ogre Oustin' minigame in Kitakami).
