## Identity & Utility
**Staryu Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutritional supplement packed with energy. Unlike generic candies, it is tailor-made for the Staryu evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought or sold for a nominal fee, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay loops rather than traditional shops.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When administered to a member of the Staryu family (**Staryu** or **Starmie**), it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 point**. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a stat-growth mechanic unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as it functions outside the traditional Effort Value (EV) system. However, it is a **mandatory optimization tool** for "No Restrictions" battles within the *Let's Go* ecosystem, where a Pokémon can gain up to +200 in every stat via AVs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is the most efficient way to maximize the combat potential of a **Starmie**, which is a premier high-speed Special Sweeper in its home games.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not typically found in Marts. It is primarily earned by catching large quantities of wild Staryu (Catch Combos), transferring Staryu to Professor Oak, or by walking a Staryu in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is a reward for conservation and research (sending specimens to the Professor) or mastery of the catching mechanic.
* **Context:** It represents the condensed "essence" of the Staryu species, reflecting the celestial and mysterious energy associated with the core of these Pokémon.
