## Identity & Utility
**Lemonade** is a **Consumable Medicine (Healing Item)** introduced in Generation I (cataloged here under Generation III).
* **Description:** A sweet, refreshing beverage used to heal Pokémon. It is a highly efficient consumable that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. While it can be held by a Pokémon, it does not trigger automatically like a Berry; it must be used manually by the trainer.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It is historically known for being more cost-effective than standard Potions and Super Potions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores a significant amount of health to a single Pokémon. 
    * *Note on Potency:* While older records (Gen I-VI) cite **80 HP** restoration, modern iterations (Gen VII onwards) have adjusted this to **70 HP**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in **mainline playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**. In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), it is non-viable as it requires a trainer turn to use and does not provide the utility of held items like Leftovers or Sitrus Berries.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Historically used in side-quests, such as giving a drink to the thirsty guards in Saffron City (Kanto) or the girl on the roof of the Celadon Dept. Store to receive TMs (e.g., Ice Beam).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from **Vending Machines** found in Department Stores, Game Corners, and various rest stops across most regions (Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, etc.). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily a manufactured consumer good within the Pokémon world.
* **Economic Tier:** It represents the "High-Tier" of the Vending Machine trio (Fresh Water < Soda Pop < Lemonade), offering the most HP restoration per bottle.
