## Identity & Utility
**TR94 (High Horsepower)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that teaches the move **High Horsepower**. Unlike the permanent TMs found in the Galar region, TRs are consumed upon use, reflecting a return to the classic "disposable" machine mechanic for high-tier moves.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). In-game, these are primarily traded for **Watts** (W) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the Pokémon the move **High Horsepower**. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Physical Ground-type attack with 95 Base Power and 95% Accuracy. The user slams into the target with its full body weight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 95 (Significant damage when used with the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Staple.** High Horsepower is the preferred Ground-type coverage for physical attackers in **VGC (Doubles)**. Unlike *Earthquake*, it is a single-target move that does not hit the user's ally. Furthermore, it is not weakened by **Grassy Terrain**, making it a vital counter-meta tool against Rillaboom or when paired with Grassy Surge users.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Not used for evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of heavy Pokémon, quadrupeds, and Ground-types (e.g., Mudsdale, Snorlax, Mamoswine).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Watt Traders:** Periodically sold by Watt Traders throughout the Galar Wild Area for a varying amount of Watts (typically 3,000–8,000 W).
    * **Max Raid Battles:** Frequently dropped as a reward for defeating **Ground-type** Raid Bosses.
    * **Cram-o-matic:** Can be synthesized in the Isle of Armor DLC using specific recipe combinations (typically involving Ground-type items).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured record of combat data. It is often gathered by players farming **Max Raid Dens** rather than through the Pickup ability.
