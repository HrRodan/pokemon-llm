## Identity & Utility
**Dragon-skull** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A historical artifact described as the skull of a Pokémon that "braved the angry waters to fly around the world." It is a **Key Item** that functions as a narrative anchor for the early-game conflict in the Unova region. It **cannot be bought or sold**, and it has no functional use in the inventory outside of specific cutscenes.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Dragon-skull serves no functional purpose in gameplay (such as healing or boosting stats). Its sole effect is to act as a **quest objective**. Once the player retrieves it from Team Plasma in Pinwheel Forest, it is returned to the museum in Nacrene City.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely for the story mode and cannot be transferred to other games or used in any competitive format.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its presence is required to satisfy the NPC scripts for Hawes and Lenora in Nacrene City.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the storyline of **Pokémon Black and White**. After Team Plasma steals the skull from the Nacrene City Museum, the player must track them through Pinwheel Forest. Upon defeating the Team Plasma Shadow Triad/Grunt, the item is added to the bag and immediately surrendered once the player returns to the museum entrance.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** While the game calls it a "Dragon-skull," its design and flavor text (referencing flying around the world and sea-crossing) are widely interpreted by the community and implied by the museum's layout to be the skeletal remains of a **Dragonite**. It represents the rich history and archaeological focus of the Nacrene City Gym/Museum.
