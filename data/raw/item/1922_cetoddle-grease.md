## Identity & Utility
**Cetoddle Grease** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Cetoddle evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** specifically designed for use at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine). It cannot be used directly from the bag to provide healing or status buffs.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**; primarily used as a crafting component or sold/exchanged for League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. Players combine this grease with League Points (LP) to create movesets.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Preparation Only).** While the item itself has no utility in a VGC or Smogon match, it is essential for the "Prep-Loop" to acquire high-value TMs for competitive builds.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly categorized under the Gen IX crafting ecosystem.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a reward for defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Paldea region. It is not available for purchase at standard Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is a **guaranteed drop** from:
    * **Cetoddle** (Commonly found in the Glaseado Mountain region).
    * **Cetitan** (Evolution found in snowy high-altitude areas).
* **Context:** This item represents the shift in Generation IX toward a "hunting and gathering" mechanic for move acquisition, replacing the previous infinite-use or single-use TM systems found in older generations.
