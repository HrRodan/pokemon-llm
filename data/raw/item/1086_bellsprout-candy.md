## Identity & Utility
**Bellsprout Candy** is a **Species-Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized nutritional supplement packed with energy. It is a **Consumable** item used to permanently enhance the power of specific Pokémon. Unlike standard vitamins, it is tailored to a specific evolutionary line and cannot be bought in traditional Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; primarily sold back to shops rather than purchased).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pokémon in the **Bellsprout, Weepinbell, or Victreebel** evolutionary line, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 point**. This contributes to the "Awakening Value" (AV) system.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item does not exist in games where Fling is a usable mechanic; it is exclusive to the *Let's Go* engine).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** While irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats, it is a mandatory requirement for optimizing Pokémon for "No-Restrictions" battles within *Let's Go, Pikachu/Eevee*, where AVs are permitted. It allows a Pokémon to reach a maximum of +200 in every stat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally restricted only to the Bellsprout family; it will have no effect on other Pokémon species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily through the **Catch Combo** mechanic (catching multiple Bellsprout in a row) or by transferring Bellsprout to **Professor Oak**. It can also be found by walking with a Pokémon in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is rewarded to the Trainer as a result of successful captures or "field research" (transferring) involving the Bellsprout species. It is a representation of the bond and effort spent training that specific evolutionary line.
