## Identity & Utility
**Sandygast Sand** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of sand left behind by a Sandygast or Palossand. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount or used at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. It is not a held item and cannot be used directly in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars / League Points (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine. It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to create moves associated with the Sandygast evolutionary line.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** While the sand itself has no competitive utility, it is required to craft highly viable competitive moves, most notably **TM133 (Earth Power)** and **TM176 (Sand Tomb)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly categorized under materials dropped by wild Pokémon upon defeat or capture.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Sandygast** or **Palossand**. In the Paldea region, these Pokémon are commonly found on beaches, such as those in the East Province (Area Two) and West Province (Area Two).
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item; it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop added directly to the "TM Materials" pocket of the inventory upon a successful encounter. It is part of the Gen IX ecological loop where trainers harvest biological materials from local fauna to synthesize move-teaching disks.
