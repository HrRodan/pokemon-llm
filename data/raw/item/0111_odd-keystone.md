## Identity & Utility
**Odd Keystone** is a **Dex-Completion** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious stone used to repair the Hallowed Tower on Route 209. It is described as containing spirits, with voices occasionally echoing from within. It functions as a **Special Interaction/Encounter Item** that is primarily consumed or placed to trigger a specific event.
* **Cost:** 2100 Poké Dollars (Mid-range value; however, it is typically acquired through exploration or mining rather than standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When placed in the **Hallowed Tower** on Sinnoh Route 209, it initiates the quest to encounter **Spiritomb**. To trigger the encounter, the player must speak to 32 other players within the Sinnoh Underground (or Grand Underground in remakes).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage for a non-competitive item, reflecting its nature as a heavy, stone-like object).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for Pokédex completion and story progression. Once used to trigger the Spiritomb encounter, it is removed from the inventory.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution, but it is the **exclusive mechanic** for obtaining Spiritomb in Generation IV and its remakes. It is tied specifically to the "Underground" gameplay loop.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Gifts:** Frequently given by an NPC on Route 208 (near Hearthome City) or found hidden in Twinleaf Town (submerged in the pond).
    * **Mining:** Can be infinitely farmed in the **Sinnoh Underground/Grand Underground** by digging into walls.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through the **Underground Mining** minigame.
* **Lore:** The item is tied to the legend of Spiritomb, a Pokémon formed by 108 spirits bound to the stone as punishment for misdeeds 500 years ago. The Odd Keystone acts as the physical tether for these spirits.
