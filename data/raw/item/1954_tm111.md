## Identity & Utility
**TM111 (Giga Drain)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in its current numbering during **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A move-teaching device used to provide a Pokémon with the Grass-type move **Giga Drain**. In the context of the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be replicated using the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafted using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Giga Drain**. This is a Special Grass-type attack with a Base Power of 75 and 100% Accuracy. The user recovers 50% of the HP drained from the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Tier / Staple.** Giga Drain is a premier recovery and coverage move for Special Attackers. It is a cornerstone for bulky Grass-types like **Amoonguss**, **Venusaur**, and **Hydrapple**, allowing them to maintain longevity while dealing consistent damage. It is also used as niche coverage for non-Grass types to check Water, Ground, and Rock threats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Grass-types and select "leafy" or "draining" thematic Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore

    * **Crafting Recipe:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, players can craft TM111 at any TM Machine using **8,000 LP**, **3 Hoppip Leaves**, and **3 Capsakid Seeds**.
    * **Overworld:** Typically found as a TM capsule (Yellow Poke Ball) in the **South Province (Area Six)** or within the **Terarium (Coastal Biome)** in the Indigo Disk DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required for its creation must be farmed from wild **Hoppip**, **Skiploom**, **Jumpluff**, **Capsakid**, and **Scovillain**.
