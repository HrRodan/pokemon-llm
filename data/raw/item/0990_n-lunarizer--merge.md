## Identity & Utility
**N-Lunarizer (Merge)** is a **Key Item** (technically categorized as "unused" in this specific data state) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A specialized high-tech machine designed to fuse **Necrozma**, a Pokémon that thrives on light, with the Legendary Pokémon **Lunala**. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, this item merges **Necrozma** and **Lunala** into a single entity known as **Dawn Wings Necrozma**. This transformation significantly boosts Necrozma's base stats, changes its type to Psychic/Ghost, and allows it to access the move *Moongeist Beam* and the specialized Z-Move *Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom* (if holding Lunalium Z).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** While the item itself isn't "held" in battle, it is the only way to access Dawn Wings Necrozma, which is a powerful restricted legendary in VGC and Ubers formats. Note that a player can only have one fused Necrozma (either Dawn Wings or Dusk Mane) at a time.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item functions similarly to the **DNA Splicers** (Kyurem) or the **N-Solarizer** (Dusk Mane Necrozma). It acts as a toggle; using the item again (as the "Split" variant) will separate the two Pokémon back into their original forms, provided there is an empty slot in the player's party.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is obtained during the post-game story. After capturing Necrozma at Mount Lanakila, the player receives both the N-Solarizer and N-Lunarizer from Colress.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique piece of technology tied to the lore of the Ultra Recon Squad and the preservation of light in the Alola region.
