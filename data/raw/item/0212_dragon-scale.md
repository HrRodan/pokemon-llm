## Identity & Utility
**Dragon Scale** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A very tough and inflexible scale often associated with Dragon-type Pokémon. It is a **consumable evolution catalyst** that must be held by a specific Pokémon during a trade to trigger its transformation. While it has a listed price, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts and is typically acquired through exploration or wild encounters.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Accessible, though usually non-purchasable in most games).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Seadra** during a trade, the Pokémon evolves into **Kingdra**. The item is consumed upon successful evolution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no viable competitive utility in battle. Its value is entirely external, serving as the gateway to **Kingdra**, a prominent "Swift Swim" rain sweeper in various competitive tiers (Smogon/VGC).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically facilitates the evolution of the Horsea line. It does not trigger any specific abilities like Pickup, though it can be intercepted by moves like Thief or Covet from wild Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in late-game locations such as the Dragon's Den, Battle Frontier, or specific sea routes. In many titles, it serves as a reward for secondary quests or can be exchanged for Battle Points (BP).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously harvestable from wild Pokémon. It is occasionally held by the **Horsea line** (Horsea, Seadra, Kingdra), the **Dratini line** (Dratini, Dragonair, Dragonite), and the **Bagon line** (Bagon, Shelgon, Salamence). 
* **Farming Strategy:** Trainers typically use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the held item rate, combined with **Thief** or **Frisk** to farm the scales from wild Dragon-types.
