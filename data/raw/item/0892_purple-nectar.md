## Identity & Utility
**Purple Nectar** is a **Species-specific Form-Change Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A vibrant flower nectar collected from specific flora, primarily found at Poni Meadow. It is a **consumable overworld item** used to trigger a phenotypic transformation in the Pokémon Oricorio. It cannot be used during a battle and is consumed upon use.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on an **Oricorio** in any other form (Baile, Pom-Pom, or Pa'u), it transforms the Pokémon into its **Sensu Style**. This changes Oricorio's primary typing to **Ghost/Flying** and alters the type of its signature move, *Revelation Dance*, to Ghost-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Pre-Battle Prep.** While the item itself has no utility in a competitive match, it is the essential tool for trainers wishing to use Oricorio-Sensu. In formats like Smogon (PU/NU) or specific VGC regulations, Sensu Style is chosen for its Ghost-type immunities (Normal/Fighting) and its ability to punish setup via the *Dancer* ability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item functions similarly to an Evolution Stone but results in a **form change** rather than an evolution. It specifically targets Oricorio and has no effect on other species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Alola:** Found naturally in the sparkling patches of flowers in **Poni Meadow**. 
    * **Paldea:** Available for purchase at **Delibird Presents** branches after obtaining a certain number of Gym Badges, reflecting its transition from a rare natural find to a commercially available specialty item.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It must be gathered from the environment or purchased from specialized retailers. Unlike items gathered via the **Pickup** ability, Purple Nectar is typically a fixed-location or shop-exclusive resource.
