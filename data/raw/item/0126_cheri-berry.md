## Identity & Utility
**Cheri Berry** is a **Medicine (Berry)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A bright red, spicy-flavored berry used to restore a Pokémon's status. It functions as a **holdable-active** consumable that allows a Pokémon to self-cure paralysis instantly during combat. It can also be manually administered from the bag both in and out of battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Immediately cures the **Paralysis** status condition. When held, it is consumed the moment the Pokémon becomes paralyzed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10. When used with the move **Fling**, the target is hit with low damage and has its paralysis cured (typically used on allies in Double Battles).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Fire-type** move with **80 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered **Niche**. In most competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), the **Lum Berry** is preferred as it cures all status conditions. However, Cheri Berries are occasionally seen in specific "Berry-restricted" formats or on sets specifically designed to bait and punish *Thunder Wave* users without wasting a Lum Berry on a less debilitating status like Burn or Confusion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It interacts with berry-related abilities such as **Harvest** (infinite reuse), **Cheek Pouch** (HP restoration upon consumption), and **Unnerve** (prevents the opponent from eating it).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available across all regions with berry-growing mechanics (Hoenn, Sinnoh, Kalos, Alola). Usually obtainable from Berry Masters or NPC gift-givers early in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently found on wild Pokémon, particularly those associated with speed or electricity, including:
    * **Blitzle / Zebstrika**
    * **Emolga**
    * **Glameow / Purugly**
    * **Crabominable**
* **Farming:** In games with growth mechanics, it has one of the fastest growth cycles, making it an easy-to-farm resource for early-game paralysis management (e.g., navigating forests filled with *Stun Spore* or *Static* users).
