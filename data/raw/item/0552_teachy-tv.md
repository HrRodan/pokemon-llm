## Identity & Utility
**Teachy TV** is a **Gameplay Item (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (specifically *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*).
* **Description:** A portable television set pre-tuned to educational programming designed to assist novice Trainers. It serves as an interactive tutorial hub, offering instructional videos on fundamental gameplay mechanics. As a Key Item, it is stored in a separate pocket of the Bag and cannot be sold, traded, or discarded.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Unique Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation from the Bag, the Teachy TV allows the player to watch several programs hosted by the "Poké Dude." These tutorials cover:
    * **Battling Basics:** Fundamentals of turn-based combat.
    * **Catching Pokémon:** A demonstration of weakening and capturing wild Pokémon.
    * **Status Problems:** Explanations of Sleep, Poison, Burn, Paralysis, and Freeze.
    * **Type Matchups:** Basic strengths and weaknesses.
    * **Registering Items:** How to use the Select button for shortcuts.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a single-player educational tool with no application in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. It exists solely to facilitate the "New Player Experience" (NPE) in the Kanto remakes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a menu-based instructional interface.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*, it is obtained from the **Old Man in Viridian City**. After the player delivers Oak's Parcel and the Old Man demonstrates how to catch a Pokémon (Weedle), he gifts the Teachy TV to the player as an apology for his earlier grumpiness.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not applicable. As a Key Item, it cannot be held by wild Pokémon or gathered via the **Pickup** ability. 
* **Lore Context:** The Teachy TV was the predecessor to more modern, integrated tutorial systems. It represents the "Poké Dude," a character who became a minor cult icon among fans for his distinct green outfit and instructional dance.
