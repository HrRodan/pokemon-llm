## Identity & Utility
**Old Gateau** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** Known as the "hidden specialty" of the Old Chateau in Sinnoh, this item functions as a regional delicacy with medicinal properties. It is a **consumable** item that is **holdable** and can be used both **in-battle and in the overworld**. 
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically limited by location rather than price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Fully restores a Pokémon from **any status ailment** (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) and also cures **Confusion**. It functions identically to a *Full Heal* or *Lum Berry*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor damage; does not transfer the status-curing effect to the target when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in **story playthroughs and Nuzlockes** as a cost-effective alternative to Full Heals. In formal competitive play (VGC/Smogon), it is generally non-viable because trainer-use items are prohibited, and as a held item, the **Lum Berry** is superior because it consumes itself automatically upon status affliction.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is categorized alongside other "Regional Specialties" like the Lava Cookie (Hoenn) and Casteliacone (Unova).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered within the **Old Chateau** in Eterna Forest. In subsequent generations, it is often obtained via specialized vendors (e.g., the Battle Subway, Battle Maison, or specific "Regional Specialty" shops). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It is typically a fixed-location pickup or a reward from NPCs, emphasizing its status as a rare, handcrafted pastry.
* **Thematic Note:** The name is a linguistic pun on its location of origin, the **Old Chateau**, playing on the phonetic similarity between "Chateau" (castle/manor) and "Gateau" (cake).
