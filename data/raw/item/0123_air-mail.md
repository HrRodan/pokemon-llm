## Identity & Utility
**Air Mail** is a **Mail Item** introduced in **Generation IV**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring colorful letter sets used for communication between players. It is a **Consumable/Held** item that is highly accessible and can be purchased at most Poké Marts. Once a message is written and the item is given to a Pokémon, it serves as a delivery vessel during trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message using a predefined list of words and phrases. The item is then held by a Pokémon to be sent to another player via trading. The recipient can read the message, store it in their PC, or erase it to reuse the stationery.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While not a "stat-boosting" item, Mail has a unique mechanical niche: **Sticky Hold Properties.** A Pokémon holding Mail cannot be placed into the PC, and more importantly, the item **cannot be removed or swapped** by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo*. In older competitive formats, this was occasionally used as a niche "Knock Off" deterrent, though it sacrificed the utility of more powerful items like Leftovers or Life Orb.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the PC system by locking the holder out of storage until the item is removed, ensuring the message is seen by the recipient.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Sinnoh region and other compatible regions (Gens II-V). It is part of a larger set of Mail items (like Bloom Mail or Brick Mail) that differ only in aesthetic design.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased by the Trainer or received via trade from another player.
* **Historical Note:** Mail items were a staple of the social "communication" era of Pokémon but were phased out of the series starting in Generation VI (X and Y), making them a legacy item in the modern franchise.
