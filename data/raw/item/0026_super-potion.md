## Identity & Utility
**Super Potion** is a healing medicine introduced in Generation I (refined in the metadata as Generation III).
* **Description:** A spray-type medicinal liquid used for treating wounds. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be used both in the overworld and during battle. It represents the second tier in the Potion hierarchy, sitting between the basic Potion and the Hyper Potion.
* **Cost:** 700 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Accessible mid-game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Restores **50 HP** to a single Pokémon. (Note: While historically 50 HP, some modern iterations adjusted this to 60 HP; however, per data, it remains a 50 HP restore).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides minimal physical damage with no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Staple.** This item is not used in standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as direct healing items are prohibited. In high-stakes "Nuzlocke" challenges, it is a vital resource for mid-game survival before Hyper Potions become financially viable.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It has no effect on evolution. While "holdable," it does not trigger automatically in battle like a Berry; it must be manually administered by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in all regions once the player has earned a specific number of Gym Badges (usually two or more). It is also frequently found as a hidden item or in "item balls" throughout mid-game routes.
* **Wild Held Item:** Generally not held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily sourced through shops or found in the field. It is a common reward from the **Pickup** ability for Pokémon between levels 11 and 50 (depending on the specific game version).
