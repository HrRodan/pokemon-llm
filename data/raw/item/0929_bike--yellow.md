## Identity & Utility
**Yellow Bike (bike--yellow)** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in provided data) introduced in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** A folding bicycle designed for rapid overworld traversal. It allows the player to move across terrain significantly faster than the default movement speed or Running Shoes. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the player's movement speed while exploring the overworld. In modern contexts (like Sword/Shield where this specific flavor text originates), it functions as the standard mode of transportation for land and, once upgraded, for crossing bodies of water.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held by Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) as it is purely an exploration tool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate Pokémon evolution. It is immune to the effects of **Pickup** and cannot be suppressed by **Klutz** because it is never a held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Despite being indexed in Generation VII (Alola), the traditional Bicycle was famously replaced by **Poké Ride** in those games. This specific entry is an "unused" data asset, likely serving as a placeholder or a remnant of the **Rotom Bike** customization system found in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), where players can select different color schemes for their gear.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique story/inventory item usually obtained via a specific NPC or quest-line (such as a Bike Shop owner or a character like the Doctor on Route 5 in Galar).
