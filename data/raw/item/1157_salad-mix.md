## Identity & Utility
**Salad-mix** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** An assortment of fresh, healthy vegetables designed specifically for the Pokémon Camp cooking mechanic. It is a **Consumable** item used to create specific types of Curry to heal and bond with Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used during a cooking minigame at a Pokémon Camp, it serves as the base ingredient to create **Salad Curry**. Depending on the quality of the cooking (determined by the berries added and the minigame performance), the resulting dish restores HP, PP, and increases the friendliness/experience points of the party Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be used in battle and provides no passive benefits when held. It is strictly a "Flavor/Utility" item for the single-player campaign and Nuzlocke resource management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of several specialized ingredients (like Spice Mix or Pasta) used to complete the **Curry Dex** in Sword and Shield.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased from **Ingredients Sellers** found in the Galar region's Wild Area (such as those at the Rolling Fields or Hammerlocke Hills). The inventory of these NPCs rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily acquired through currency exchange or as a random reward from NPCs in the Wild Area.
* **World Context:** Represents the regional culture of Galar, emphasizing the "Pokémon Camp" lifestyle where trainers cook nutritious meals to maintain the stamina of their team during long treks through the wilderness.
