## Identity & Utility
**Lunar-wing** is an **Event-Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A beautiful feather that emits a glow reminiscent of the moon. It possesses the unique mystical power to dispel dark illusions and nightmares. It is a **Key Item** (though categorized under event-items) that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; Unique plot item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its primary function is a story-based cure. It is used specifically to wake the sailor’s son in Canalave City from a permanent, Darkrai-induced nightmare. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a quest-essential item used exclusively for overworld progression and legendary encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon, it is the catalyst for the player's pursuit of the Legendary Pokémon **Cresselia**. In later generations (such as *Black 2/White 2*), it acts as a summoning item to encounter Cresselia on the Marvelous Bridge.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally obtained on **Fullmoon Island** after the player interacts with Cresselia for the first time. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is obtained during the mission "The Plate of Moonview Arena."
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact associated with the "Lunar Duo" (Cresselia and Darkrai).
* **Lore Context:** The Lunar Wing serves as the direct thematic antithesis to the **Enigma Moon** or the nightmares caused by Darkrai. It represents hope and recovery, functioning as a beacon that guides the player toward the "Lunar Pokémon," Cresselia.
