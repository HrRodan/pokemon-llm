## Identity & Utility
**Burn Heal** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation I** (metadata updated in Generation III).
* **Description:** A spray-type medicinal treatment designed to cure a single Pokémon of the Burn status condition. It is a **consumable** item that can be used both in the **overworld** and **during battle**.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Instantly cures the **Burn** status. This is critical for physical attackers, as the Burn status typically halves the victim's Attack stat in addition to dealing recurring damage each turn.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Deals minor damage when thrown; has no secondary effect via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used for **Main Story playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges**. In competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), bag items are restricted; players utilize the **Rawst Berry** or **Lum Berry** as held items to achieve this effect automatically.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It is a standard tier status recovery item, positioned below the **Full Heal** (which cures all statuses) and the **Full Restore** (which cures all statuses and restores HP).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Highly accessible; it is a staple product sold at **Poké Marts** in all regions. It is often one of the first status-cures available to players.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which are natural, Burn Heals are manufactured "spray-type" pharmaceuticals. They are frequently found as floor loot in areas populated by Fire-type Pokémon, such as **Fiery Path** or **Cinnabar Island**, serving as a localized utility for the player.
