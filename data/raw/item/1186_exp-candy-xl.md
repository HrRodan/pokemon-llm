## Identity & Utility
**Exp. Candy XL** is a **Vitamin (Growth Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A high-tier consumable candy packed with energy. It is the largest variant in the Exp. Candy hierarchy (XS, S, M, L, XL). Unlike Rare Candies, which increase a Pokémon's level by exactly one, this item provides a fixed, massive amount of experience points. It is a **Consumable** item that is generally **not for sale** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high internal price, it is primarily an earned reward rather than a purchasable commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a Pokémon, it grants exactly **30,000 Experience Points**. This is highly efficient for quickly leveling up Pokémon, especially those in slower leveling groups, or for rapidly reaching level 100 for Hyper Training.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (No additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has no direct utility in battle. However, it is **essential for competitive preparation**. It is the primary tool used by VGC and Smogon players to level Pokémon to 50 (for standard play) or 100 (to enable the use of Bottle Caps for IV modification).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** If the experience gained causes a Pokémon to level up while meeting its evolution requirements, the evolution process will be triggered immediately.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exp. Candy XL is rarely found in the overworld. Its primary source is as a high-tier reward for completing **5-star and 6-star Max Raid Battles** (Sword/Shield) or **High-level Tera Raid Battles** (Scarlet/Violet). It represents a reward for defeating powerful, dynamaxed, or terastallized opponents.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by wild Pokémon**. It cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability; it must be earned through raid participation or specific end-game distributions.
