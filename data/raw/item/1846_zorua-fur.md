## Identity & Utility
**Zorua Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A crafting component dropped by members of the Zorua evolutionary line. As a material, it is primarily stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag and is used exclusively at the Technical Machine Machine located at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (Cheap). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value is its use as a reagent for crafting TMs.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). Once used at a TM Machine, the fur is consumed along with League Points (LP) to create a reusable move-teaching disc.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it has no `fling_power` or `fling_effect`).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This is a non-combat utility item used for team preparation rather than active battle strategy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Generation IX crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained by defeating or catching wild **Zorua** or **Zoroark**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This is not a held item, but a guaranteed drop upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Zorua line. 
* **Acquisition Context:** Farming Zorua Fur can be challenging due to Zorua's **Illusion** ability, which causes it to appear as other Pokémon in the overworld. Players must engage or target Pokémon to reveal their true identity. In the Paldea region, Zorua is frequently found in Tagtree Thicket and West Province (Area Three), while Zoroark can be found in the Socarrat Trail. It is also available in the Kitakami and Blueberry Academy regions.
