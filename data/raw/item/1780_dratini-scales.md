## Identity & Utility
**Dratini Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material shed by Dratini. It is a consumable crafting resource used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific moves. It is a **Consumable Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or converted into League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Material value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting TMs. Specifically, it is required to craft high-value Dragon-type moves, most notably **TM156 (Outrage)** and **TM169 (Draco Meteor)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly restricted to the **Preparation Phase**, allowing trainers to teach powerful Dragon-type coverage or STAB moves to their competitive roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the "Dragon Scale," the **Dratini Scales** item has no effect on the evolution of Seadra or any other Pokémon. It does not interact with abilities like Pickup.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively in the Paldea region (and associated DLC areas) by defeating or catching members of the Dratini evolutionary line.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item," it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Dratini** and **Dragonair**. It is most efficiently gathered by battling these Pokémon in water-based biomes or during Mass Outbreaks.
* **Lore context:** These scales are described as being part of the life cycle of the "Mirage Pokémon," symbolizing the shedding process Dratini undergoes as it grows rapidly.
