## Identity & Utility
**Lopunnite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in Generation VI (specifically *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire*), with the provided data reflecting its categorization in Generation VII.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystallized stone that enables a specific species transformation. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be purchased** in standard Poké Marts. It is strictly used in battle to trigger Mega Evolution and cannot be consumed or used overworld for healing.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a rare, unique acquisition typically rewarded through post-game content or special events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Lopunny, the trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transforms Lopunny into **Mega Lopunny**, significantly increasing its Attack and Speed stats and changing its ability to **Scrappy**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In standard play, Mega Stones cannot be removed by *Knock Off* or *Thief* if held by the correct Pokémon, and *Fling* will fail if the Pokémon is capable of Mega Evolving).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Gen 6 & 7 OU/VGC), Lopunnite is essential. Mega Lopunny is a premier offensive threat because the Scrappy ability allows its STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) Normal and Fighting moves—like *High Jump Kick* and *Return*—to hit Ghost-type Pokémon that would otherwise be immune.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution; it is a temporary mid-battle transformation. It is unaffected by the ability *Pickup* and cannot be used by a Pokémon with the *Klutz* ability (though Lopunny often has Klutz before Mega Evolving, the ability is replaced upon transformation).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found in specific post-game locations. In its debut (*ORAS*), it is obtained in Mauville City. In Generation VII (*Sun/Moon*), it was initially a limited-time Mystery Gift and later made available via the Battle Tree for 64 BP.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique treasure that must be found or gifted, reflecting its status as a bond-enhancing artifact between a Trainer and their Pokémon.
