## Identity & Utility
**Power Band** is a **Competitive Training Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized weight used for conditioning. While held, it significantly hampers the Pokémon's movement but accelerates the growth of its Special Defense. It is a **Holdable Training Item** that can be bought, though it is often restricted to specialized shops or exchange counters.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard** for specialized training equipment). In many regions, it is more commonly acquired via Battle Points (BP) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon’s **Speed is reduced by 50%**. In exchange, whenever the holder earns Effort Values (EVs) from defeating an opponent, they receive an additional **+4 Special Defense EVs** (this bonus increased to +8 in Generation VII). This bonus is applied before the doubling effect of Pokérus.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Strong physical damage, no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Training Staple**. It is not used for direct combat effectiveness but is essential for "EV Training" builds. By reducing Speed, it can also be used nichely in **Trick Room** strategies during the main story to ensure a Pokémon moves first, though other items like Iron Ball are generally superior for that specific purpose.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding (World Knowledge):** From *HeartGold/SoulSilver* onward, if a Pokémon holds the Power Band while in the Day Care or Nursery, it is guaranteed to pass its **Special Defense IV** down to its offspring.
    * **Ability Synergy:** This item is ignored by Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available at post-game facilities such as the **Battle Frontier**, **Battle Subway**, **Battle Maison**, or **Battle Tree**. In some modern titles, it can be purchased at Delibird Presents or similar specialized retailers.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It is considered a man-made training tool and must be acquired through trainers' organizations or specialized shops. It is often gathered in sets alongside other "Power Items" (Power Weight, Power Bracer, etc.) to complete a training regimen.
