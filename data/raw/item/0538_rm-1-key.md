## Identity & Utility
**Rm-1-key** (Room 1 Key) is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A specific, fragile-looking key required to progress through the sub-quest of the Abandoned Ship (known as Sea Mauville in later iterations). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon. 
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique quest item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Unlocks the door to **Room 1** on the Abandoned Ship. Its use is strictly limited to overworld progression within this specific location.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for exploration and narrative progression within the single-player campaign.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of a sequential "key-hunt" puzzle where finding one key typically leads the player to the next (e.g., Room 2 Key, Room 4 Key, etc.), eventually leading to the Scanner or specialized TMs/items like the Ice Beam TM or the Storage Key.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the **Abandoned Ship** (Route 108) in the original Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald versions. In the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire remakes, it is found in **Sea Mauville**. It is typically found by searching sparkling spots on the floor or hidden inside trash cans/crates within the ship's cabins.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique item tied to the Hoenn region's environmental storytelling, representing the decaying state of the vessel (described in flavor text as "old and looks easily broken").
