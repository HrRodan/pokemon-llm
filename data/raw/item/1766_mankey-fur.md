## Identity & Utility
**Mankey Fur** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A clump of fur shed or dropped by the Mankey evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. While it can be sold at a Poké Mart, its primary purpose is as a currency for the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource Material).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to craft specific TMs. It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to create move-teaching discs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It serves strictly as a "World/Inventory" resource. However, it is fundamentally important for the competitive meta-game as it is a required component for crafting top-tier physical moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not used for evolution. It is specifically tied to the Mankey, Primeape, and Annihilape family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the **Paldea region** (and other Gen IX locales). It is awarded to the player after defeating or catching wild **Mankey**, **Primeape**, or **Annihilape**.
* **Wild Drops:** This is a guaranteed drop from the following Pokémon:
    * **Mankey**
    * **Primeape**
    * **Annihilape**
* **Crafting Context:** Based on standard Gen IX recipes, Mankey Fur is typically required for TMs associated with Fighting-type moves or physical prowess, most notably:
    * **TM012 (Low Kick)**
    * **TM039 (Low Sweep)**
    * **TM064 (Bulk Up)**
    * **TM108 (Helping Hand)**
    * **TM167 (Close Combat)**
