## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SCO6553** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it forces a Dynamax Pokémon to appear for a limited time. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Promotional Value**; though it has a internal cost, it is acquired via serial codes rather than Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific inactive Pokémon Den in the Galar Wild Area), it summons a specific Dynamax Pokémon encounter that persists until the end of the calendar day. For **SCO6553**, this specifically summons **Stonjourner**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** While the item itself has no competitive utility, it is used by players to secure encounters with Stonjourner, which possesses the unique **Power Spot** ability—a potent asset in VGC Doubles for boosting the damage of allies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Using this crystal allows players to face the Pokémon regardless of the current weather or standard Den rotation. Unlike standard Raid Dens, these encounters do not require Wishing Pieces once the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a **Limited-Time Serial Code** or promotional reward (often associated with retail tie-ins or special edition purchases of *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*). It is not available through normal progression or NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. As an event-exclusive item, it cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or **Thief** mechanics.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are solidified clusters of Galar particles. Unlike the naturally occurring energy in Power Spots, these crystals are calibrated to specific frequencies (represented by the SCO code), acting as a beacon for specific species of Dynamax-capable Pokémon.
