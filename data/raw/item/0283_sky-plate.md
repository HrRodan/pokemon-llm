## Identity & Utility
**Sky Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet engraved with rare text. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that functions as both a type-booster and a form-change catalyst. While it has a data cost of 1,000 Poké Dollars, it is typically not found in standard marts, instead appearing as a hidden treasure or archaeological find.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (Relatively cheap, though generally categorized as a "Special Acquisition").

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of **Flying-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Multitype Interaction:** If held by **Arceus**, the Pokémon’s base type changes to **Flying**, and its signature move, **Judgment**, also becomes Flying-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage). This is a significant Fling value, though the item is usually too valuable to consume in this manner.
    * **Competitive Use:** It is a mandatory item for the **Arceus-Flying** form in Ubers/Restricted formats. For other Pokémon, it is a niche alternative to the *Sharp Beak*, though functionally identical in its 20% damage boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Plates" group. It is classified as `holdable-active`, meaning its effect is constantly checked by the game engine to determine the holder's form and move power.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found through exploration, such as the **Grand Underground** in Sinnoh, or awarded at significant locations like the **Spear Pillar** or **Victory Road**. In more recent titles (like *Legends: Arceus*), it is a key artifact obtained by defeating or interacting with Noble Pokémon or legendary encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered via the **Underground** mining mechanic or found as a static hidden item.
* **Lore context:** The Sky Plate is one of the fragments of the original power used by Arceus to create the universe, specifically representing the element of the skies.
