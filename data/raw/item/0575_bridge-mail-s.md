## Identity & Utility
**Bridge Mail S** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring an illustration of a bridge that "seems to pierce the sky" (referencing the Skyarrow Bridge). It is a **Consumable/Held** item used to send personalized messages to other players during Pokémon trades. 
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer can compose a message from a finite list of phrases and words and give the mail to a Pokémon to hold. The recipient of the Pokémon can read the message and choose to store it in their PC or erase it to reuse the stationery.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Defensive Utility.** While Mail provides no stat or tactical benefits, it has a unique mechanical property: **it cannot be removed or stolen.** Moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Covet*, and *Trick* will fail against a Pokémon holding Mail. In historical niche metas, this was occasionally used to scout for these moves or ensure an item slot remained occupied, though it is largely ignored in favor of items like Leftovers or Life Orb.
* **Special Constraints:** 
    * **PC Storage:** A Pokémon holding Bridge Mail S **cannot be placed in the PC**. This mechanic ensures that players do not "lose" messages in their storage system; the Mail must be removed before the Pokémon can be deposited.
    * **Stickiness:** Unlike most held items, Mail cannot be swapped or moved easily in battle, acting as a "sticky" item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available in the **Unova region**. It is typically sold at the Poké Mart in Castelia City or by specialized vendors on the various bridges of Unova (specifically near the Skyarrow Bridge).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The "S" in Bridge Mail S stands for **Skyarrow Bridge**, the massive suspension bridge connecting Pinwheel Forest to Castelia City. It is part of a thematic set of stationery that celebrates the architectural landmarks of the Unova region.
