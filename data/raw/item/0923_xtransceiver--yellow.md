## Identity & Utility
**Xtransceiver (Yellow)** is a communication-based **Key Item** variant appearing in the data of **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A high-tech transceiver equipped with a camera function designed to facilitate up to four-way video calls. While its flavor text describes it as a functional communication tool, in the context of the Alola-region games, it is categorized as **Unused**. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its intended functional state (based on its Unova-region counterparts), the Xtransceiver allows the player to communicate with NPCs to receive guidance or progress the plot. However, this specific Yellow variant in Generation VII serves no functional purpose and possesses no programmed effect.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely within the game's internal data and provides no tactical advantage in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution and does not interact with any known Pokémon abilities.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable** via normal gameplay. It remains in the game code of *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon* as a "dummy" or placeholder item.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon.
* **World Knowledge:** The Xtransceiver was originally the signature communication device of the Unova region (Gen V). The presence of a "Yellow" variant in the Alola data suggests it was either a leftover asset from previous generations or intended for a scrapped feature involving multi-colored UI customization for the player's communication tools.
