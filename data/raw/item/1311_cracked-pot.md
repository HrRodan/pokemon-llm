## Identity & Utility
**Cracked Pot** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar Region).
* **Description:** A peculiar, damaged teapot used to trigger the evolution of a specific Pokémon species. Despite its structural flaws, it remains functional for brewing tea. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that can be purchased or found in the overworld.
* **Cost:** 1,600 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a **Sinistea (Phony Form)**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Polteageist (Phony Form)**. The item is consumed upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Significant physical damage when thrown using the move Fling, though it lacks a secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **Non-Competitive** item in battle. Its utility is strictly limited to the "out-of-battle" evolution of Sinistea. However, the resulting evolution, Polteageist, is a notable competitive threat due to the move *Shell Smash* and the ability *Weak Armor*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Form Specificity:** The Cracked Pot only works on the "Phony Form" of Sinistea (the common version lacking a mark of authenticity on the bottom of the cup). It will not work on the "Antique Form," which requires the *Chipped Pot*.
    * **Consumption:** Like an Evolution Stone, it is destroyed after the evolution process is complete.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Galar (Sword/Shield):** Most commonly obtained via the **Bargain Shop in Stow-on-Side**, where the merchant's inventory rotates daily. It can also be found as a fixed item drop in the **Glimwood Tangle**.
    * **Paldea (Scarlet/Violet):** Available at the **Porto Marinada auction** or found as a sparkling pickup in the Socarrat Trail.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered through world exploration or specialized vendors rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild farming.
* **Lore Context:** The item highlights the "counterfeit" lore of the Sinistea line; the Cracked Pot is the matching vessel for the common, mass-produced "Phony" ghosts, whereas the Chipped Pot is reserved for the rare, authentic antiques.
