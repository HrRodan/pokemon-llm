## Identity & Utility
**Mawilite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone that acts as a catalyst for Mega Evolution. When held by a Mawile, it allows the Pokémon to transcend its base form during battle. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that **cannot be purchased** with standard currency (Cost: 0), typically requiring discovery in the overworld or acquisition through special BP (Battle Point) vendors.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Special Acquisition/Key Item status).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Mawile, the trainer can trigger a **Mega Evolution** at the start of a turn. This transforms Mawile into **Mega Mawile**, significantly increasing its Attack and Defense stats and granting it the **Huge Power** ability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Base power is high, but flinging a Mega Stone is strategically detrimental as it removes the ability to Mega Evolve).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Elite Competitive Staple.** In formats where Mega Evolution is permitted (Gen VI-VII), the Mawilite is mandatory for Mawile. Mega Mawile is a premier physical wallbreaker, often banned to the **Ubers** tier or serving as a top-tier threat in **OU** due to its Steel/Fairy typing and the doubling of its Attack stat via Huge Power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is unique to the Mawile evolutionary line. Unlike standard held items, Mega Stones **cannot** be removed by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*, nor can they be negated by the ability *Klutz* if the holder is capable of Mega Evolving.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally found in late-game or post-game scenarios. 
    * In **Pokémon X/Y**, it is found in the Glittering Cave after upgrading the Mega Ring.
    * In **Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire**, it is located in the Cave of Origin. 
    * In **Sun/Moon/USUM**, it is obtainable via the Battle Tree or through specific limited-time Mystery Gift distributions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is an artifact of immense power and must be sourced from specific legendary locations or high-level battle facilities.
