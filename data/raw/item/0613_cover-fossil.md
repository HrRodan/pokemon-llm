## Identity & Utility
**Cover Fossil** is a **dex-completion** item (Fossil) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A fossilized remains of a prehistoric sea-dwelling Pokémon. It appears to be a segment of a hard shell or back. It is a **Consumable** restoration item that serves as the catalyst for obtaining extinct species. While it has a data-defined cost, it is typically acquired through discovery or as a choice-based gift.
* **Cost:** 7,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**; high resale value, though rarely available for purchase in standard Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When delivered to a restoration specialist (such as the scientist in the Nacrene City Museum or the Fossil Lab in Ambrette Town), it is revived into the Water/Rock-type Pokémon **Tirtouga**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 100 (Heavy damage). Using Fling with this item consumes the fossil, making it a high-risk, low-reward offensive move given the item's rarity.
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. However, the resulting Pokémon, **Carracosta**, is a niche competitive threat in lower tiers (like Smogon PU/ZU) utilizing the **Shell Smash** setup move combined with the **Sturdy** or **Solid Rock** abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Revives **Tirtouga**, which subsequently evolves into **Carracosta** at Level 37. It is traditionally the counterpart to the **Plume Fossil** (Archen); in its debut games, players were required to choose one, making the other obtainable only through trade.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Unova:** Gifted by a Hiker in Twist Mountain (Black/White) or selected at the Nacrene City Museum (Black 2/White 2).
    * **Kalos:** Found in Glittering Cave by using Rock Smash on breakable rocks (Pokémon X exclusive).
    * **Alola:** Purchasable at the Konikoni City Stone Shop (Pokémon Sun exclusive).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In some titles, it can be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or specialized mining mini-games (like the Underground or Poké Pelago).
* **Lore:** The Cover Fossil represents the "Cover" or carapace of an ancient turtle Pokémon that lived in the oceans millions of years ago. It serves as a bridge between the modern Pokémon world and the prehistoric era.
