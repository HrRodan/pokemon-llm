## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (oph6149)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a rare, consumable event item used specifically at the **Watchtower Lair** located in the Wild Area of the Galar region. Once activated, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, typically a Gigantamax-capable **Orbeetle** (based on the internal event index)—which remains available until the end of the day. It is a consumable event-trigger item that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Symbolic cost; typically distributed via serial codes and not found in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair, it causes a beam of red light to appear, initiating a Max Raid Battle encounter. The specific Pokémon appearing is predetermined by the crystal's ID. This allows players to encounter rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon that may not be currently active in the standard raid rotation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. The item itself has no competitive battle utility, but it is a critical tool for collectors and competitive players to catch Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities** or **Gigantamax Factors** for use in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. It does not trigger evolution but provides the opportunity to capture a Pokémon that may possess the Gigantamax Factor.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Limited/Promotional.** These crystals were primarily distributed through serial codes via retail partnerships (such as GameStop, Target, or CoroCoro) rather than standard in-game Marts. They are one-time use; once the raid is triggered, the crystal is consumed.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an "out-of-bag" trigger item similar to a Key Item, though it is categorized as a consumable in the game's data.
* **Context:** The "oph6149" suffix refers to a specific distribution event. In the Galar region’s lore, these crystals are highly concentrated fragments of Wishing Stars used to focus Galar particles into a single point to force a Dynamax projection.
