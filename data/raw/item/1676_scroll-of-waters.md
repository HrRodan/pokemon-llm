## Identity & Utility
**Scroll of Waters** is a **Gameplay (Evolution)** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Isle of Armor)**.
*   **Description:** A peculiar scroll that depicts the secrets of the "Way of the Water." It is a **Key Item** that cannot be sold or discarded. It serves as a specialized evolution catalyst specifically for the Legendary Pokémon Kubfu.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through gameplay progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When shown to a **Kubfu** at the summit of the **Tower of Waters**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Urshifu (Rapid Strike Style)**. Unlike standard evolution stones, this item is location-dependent and tied to the completion of the Tower's trials. 
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no direct battle utility, it is the sole gateway to obtaining **Rapid Strike Urshifu**. This Pokémon is a dominant competitive staple in VGC and Smogon formats due to its signature move, *Surging Strikes*, and its ability, *Unseen Fist*, which bypasses protection moves like Protect and Detect.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This is a branching evolution item. Choosing the Scroll of Waters permanently locks the player out of obtaining the Single Strike Style (Dark/Fighting) on that specific Kubfu, as the choice between the Tower of Waters and the Tower of Darkness is mutually exclusive.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Obtained exclusively at the **Tower of Waters** on the **Isle of Armor**. The player must lead a Kubfu through the five floors of the tower and defeat the Master (Mustard) to earn the right to read the scroll.
*   **Wild Held Item:** None. This is a unique story-related item and cannot be found on wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
*   **Lore Context:** The scroll represents one of the two distinct martial arts disciplines taught at the Master Dojo. The "Way of the Water" emphasizes fluid, multi-strike movements intended to overwhelm the opponent like a relentless current.
