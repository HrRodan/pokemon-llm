## Identity & Utility
**Meadow-Plate** is a **Plate** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious stone tablet imbued with the essence of nature. It functions as a specialized **Competitive Held Item** that enhances Grass-type offense and serves as a critical form-change component for the Mythical Pokémon Arceus. It is a **holdable-active** item that is typically found through exploration or excavation rather than standard retail.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Affordable, though rarely sold in standard Poké Marts; usually treated as a rare find).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon, it increases the power of the holder's **Grass-type moves by 20%**. 
* **Arceus Synergy:** If held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (Arceus), the holder’s primary type changes to **Grass**, and its signature move, **Judgment**, also becomes Grass-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when used with the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    * **Competitive Use:** While generally outclassed by *Life Orb* or *Choice* items for general damage, Plates are the **standard requirement** for Grass-type Arceus sets in Uber tiers. In standard play, it is a niche alternative to *Miracle Seed*, providing the same 20% boost without the risk of being "tricked" or "knocked off" as easily in some specific mechanical contexts (though it can still be removed in most generations).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not a trigger for evolution but is essential for changing the form and elemental affinity of Arceus.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically acquired through the **Sinnoh Underground** (indicated by its `underground` attribute) or found in specific hidden locations behind plates-related riddles (e.g., near the Eterna City statue or in the Great Marsh). In later generations, it is often found in ruins or provided by NPCs when the player possesses an Arceus.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held by any wild Pokémon**. It is considered a unique relic rather than a naturally occurring biological item. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it must be found as a fixed item on the ground or via specialized mining mechanics.
