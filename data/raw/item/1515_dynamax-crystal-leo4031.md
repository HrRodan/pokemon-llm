## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Leo4031** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—traditionally associated with special distributions or pre-order bonuses—to appear for a Raid encounter. It is a **Consumable/Event** item that **cannot** be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Not for sale**; the cost is a placeholder for internal game logic as the item is distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the East Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area) while carrying this crystal, it activates a Max Raid Battle. The summoned Pokémon persists until the end of the day (midnight) or until defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate an encounter with a specific Pokémon. The Pokémon caught from these raids may have competitive value (e.g., Hidden Abilities or high IVs), but the item itself has no tactical application in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It serves as a "key" to unlock a specific encounter. Unlike standard Max Raid Dens, crystals allow for a guaranteed specific encounter regardless of the current den rotation or weather.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is **Event-Exclusive**. Specifically, the "Leo" series of Dynamax Crystals were distributed via serial codes, often as bonuses for purchasing the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Double Pack or through retail promotions (such as those at GameStop, Pokémon Centers, or CoroCoro Magazine). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered via the **Mystery Gift** function as a "Get with Code/Password" reward.
* **Context:** In the Galar region's lore, these crystals are highly concentrated shards of Wishing Stars that react specifically with the Watchtower Lair, an ancient structure that acts as a focal point for Dynamax energy.
