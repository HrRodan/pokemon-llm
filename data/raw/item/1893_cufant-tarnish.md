## Identity & Utility
**Cufant Tarnish** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item represents biological scrap or oxidation shed from the Cufant evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** used primarily at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. While it has a listed cost, it cannot be bought from standard Poké Marts; it is gathered through exploration and battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Minimal). Its primary value lies in being exchanged for **League Points (LP)** or used as a recipe ingredient.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is a required material for high-impact Steel-type moves, most notably:
    * **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**
    * **TM170 (Steel Beam)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (Cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This is a "world-map" resource item used for team building and move-set optimization rather than active combat.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency for the TM crafting system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Cufant family. It is most commonly found in the **Province areas of Paldea** where Steel-types congregate.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is dropped by wild **Cufant** and **Copperajah**. Players often farm this material by using "Auto-Battle" (Let's Go! feature) in areas where Cufant are abundant to quickly amass the quantity needed for Steel-type TM production.
* **Lore:** The item represents the natural patina and metallic shavings that fall from Cufant's copper-heavy hide, which is said to change color as it oxidizes in the Paldean air.
