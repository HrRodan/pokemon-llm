## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CnC3572)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized promotional consumable used in *Pokémon Sword and Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle. Based on the "CnC" nomenclature, this specific crystal was tied to a *CoroCoro* comic promotion to encounter **Gigantamax Centiskorch**. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Promotional**; though assigned a low value in the data, it is effectively priceless as it is acquired via serial code and cannot be bought in Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the North Lake Miloch section of the Wild Area), a red beam of light is activated. This causes a specific Pokémon (in this case, Gigantamax Centiskorch) to appear as a Max Raid boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day it was used or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; its purpose is strictly for PvE (Player vs. Environment) acquisition of rare Pokémon with the Gigantamax factor.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed exclusively via **Serial Code** promotions. The "CnC3572" variant was a physical distribution through Japanese retail and magazines (CoroCoro). It is not available through standard Marts or the Armorite Ore/Watts traders.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item intended for a single-use raid encounter. Unlike standard Max Raid dens, the Dynamax Crystal encounter is guaranteed and does not require Wishing Pieces.
