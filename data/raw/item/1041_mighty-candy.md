## Identity & Utility
**Mighty Candy** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with energy used to permanently enhance a Pokémon's physical prowess. It is a **Consumable** item used from the bag and **cannot be bought** at standard Poké Marts in significant quantities, though it has a nominal sell/buy value in the data. It is the basic tier of the "Mighty" candy family.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Internal Value**; primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, it increases a Pokémon's **Attack stat** by adding +1 to its **Awakening Value (AV)**. In the *Let's Go* series, this replaces the traditional Effort Value (EV) system, allowing a Pokémon to gain up to +200 in a single stat regardless of level.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The move *Fling* does not exist in the games where this item is present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** While vital for maximizing damage output in *Let's Go* competitive formats (No Restrictions), this item does not exist in the mainline series (Gen VIII onwards) and cannot be transferred. It is a staple for physical attackers like Machamp or Arcanine within its specific engine.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of a size-based hierarchy: **Mighty Candy** (Small) < **Mighty Candy L** < **Mighty Candy XL**. As a Pokémon's level increases, it requires the higher tiers (L and XL) to continue boosting stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through the **Catch Challenge** mechanic or by **transferring Pokémon to Professor Oak**. Successfully catching physical-attacker-themed Pokémon (like Mankey or Sandshrew) frequently rewards this item.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered by "grinding" Pokémon into candies via Professor Oak, a mechanic inspired by *Pokémon GO*. It is a core component of the "AV training" loop used by trainers to make their team significantly stronger than those found in traditional Pokémon games.
