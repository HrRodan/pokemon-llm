## Identity & Utility
**Flame Plate** is a **Plate** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An ancient stone tablet inscribed with power. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Holdable-Active**, meaning its effects are triggered during battle. While it has a technical price, it is rarely found in standard shops and is often treated as a collectible artifact.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Affordable, but typically acquired through exploration rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Boosts the power of the holder's **Fire-type moves by 20%**. Additionally, if held by a Pokémon with the **Multitype** ability (specifically **Arceus**), the holder’s primary type and the move **Judgment** both become Fire-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output; no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used as a mandatory held item for **Arceus-Fire** in high-tier competitive formats (Ubers). For non-legendary Pokémon, it is often outclassed by *Life Orb* (30% boost to all moves) or *Choice Specs*, though it remains a viable niche alternative to *Charcoal* for boosting Fire damage without recoil or move-locking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Directly interacts with the **Multitype** ability. It is categorized as an **Underground** item, signifying its historical acquisition method via the Sinnoh Underground mining mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically discovered through the **Sinnoh Underground** or found as a hidden item in locations tied to Heatran or volcanic activity (e.g., Stark Mountain). In recent titles like *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is a key story item obtained by defeating or calming Noble Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon species. It is a unique or limited-quantity item that cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability.
