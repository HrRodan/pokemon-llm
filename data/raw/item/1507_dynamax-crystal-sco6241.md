## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (sco6241)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a special, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use utility item that cannot be bought through standard gameplay channels.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal price, it is not sold in Poké Marts and is typically obtained via serial codes or promotional distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—associated with the unique crystal ID (sco6241)—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. This allows players to battle and catch Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a world-map utility item intended for single-player or co-operative Max Raid Battles. It has no function in ranked VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. Once the raid is activated, the crystal is consumed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific variant (sco6241) was primarily distributed as a **pre-order bonus** or through retail partnerships (such as the Pokémon Sword & Shield Dual Pack). Players would receive a serial code to redeem in-game to obtain the crystal.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never found on wild Pokémon**. It is an external event-based resource.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated fragments of Galar particles that can force a Dynamax phenomenon to occur in a specific location, even if no natural Power Spot energy is currently active there.
