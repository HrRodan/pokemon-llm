## Identity & Utility
**Wide Lens** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized magnifying lens designed to be held by a Pokémon. It provides a constant, passive boost to the holder's precision. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that can be purchased in various regions, typically at specialized shops or battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced; accessible mid-to-late game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases the accuracy of any move the holder uses by **10% of its base accuracy (multiplicative)**. For example, a move with 90% accuracy (like *Play Rough*) becomes 99%, while a move with 70% accuracy (like *Focus Blast* or *Hurricane*) becomes 77%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; no secondary Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Niche Staple**. It is most effectively used by Pokémon with high-power, low-accuracy moves or multi-hit moves where each strike requires a separate accuracy check. Most notably, it is the standard item for **Maushold** to ensure *Population Bomb* hits the maximum 10 times, and is frequently used on **Cinccino** or users of *Triple Axel* and *High Jump Kick*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Unlike the *Zoom Lens* (which grants a 20% boost but only if the holder moves after the target), the Wide Lens provides a flat, reliable bonus regardless of turn order. It does not trigger any evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Department Stores (e.g., Veilstone City) or exchanged for BP in Battle Facilities. In more recent generations, it can be purchased at Delibird Presents branches.
* **Wild Held Item:** Historically found on wild **Yanma**, **Yanmega**, and **Sableye** (typically a 5% held rate). Competitive players often farm these using a Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase the hold rate) and **Thief** or **Covet**.
