## Identity & Utility
**Enigma Berry** is a rare Berry introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious and exotic Berry that provides reactive healing. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that triggers specifically when the holder is targeted by an opponent's tactical advantage. While it has a nominal cost of **80 Poké Dollars**, it is rarely found in standard Poké Marts and is considered a high-value collector's item or event-only resource in many regions.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, though its rarity makes it far more valuable than its price suggests).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holding Pokémon is hit by a **super-effective attack**, it consumes the Enigma Berry to instantly restore **1/4 (25%) of its maximum HP**. This occurs after the damage is dealt, potentially preventing a knockout from a subsequent hit.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Low damage; generally not recommended for Fling-based strategies).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it transforms into a **Bug-type** attack with a base power of **100** (Gen IV+).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically **Niche**. While it offers significant healing, it is often outclassed by the **Sitrus Berry** (which activates at 50% HP regardless of move type) or the **Weakness Policy** (which boosts offensive stats when hit super-effectively). It is most effective on bulky Pokémon with a "4x weakness" (e.g., Tyranitar or Dragonite) that are expected to survive a super-effective hit but need an immediate health buffer to continue a sweep or set up.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with the **Ripen** ability (doubling the HP restoration to 50%) and is affected by **Unnerve**, which prevents the opponent from consuming it.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Traditionally one of the rarest Berries in the franchise. In Generation III, it was only obtainable via the **Nintendo e-Reader** (as a "Pump-up Berry"). In subsequent generations, it is often distributed via **special events** (frequently held by Mythical Pokémon like Darkrai) or found in late-game Berry piles and specialized gardening locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on common wild Pokémon. It is typically associated with **event-distributed Pokémon** and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability in most titles. Its name and appearance change across different localizations and e-Reader cards, adding to its "enigmatic" reputation.
