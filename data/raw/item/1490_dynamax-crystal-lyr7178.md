## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Lyr7178** is a **Special Event/Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** This is a consumable event item used specifically in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell area), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that functions as an encounter-modifier.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a defined cost in the data, it is not available for purchase at standard Poké Marts; it is traditionally distributed via serial codes or promotional bonuses.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, the item summons a specific Pokémon—historically associated with the "Lyr" designation (such as **Larvitar** in specific version-exclusive distributions)—into a Max Raid Battle. This allows the player to battle and catch the Pokémon regardless of the current weather or standard spawn tables.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is an overworld trigger).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no combat application, it is used by competitive players to secure specific Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or difficult to find with high Individual Values (IVs) and Hidden Abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Wild Area. It does not trigger evolutions but facilitates the acquisition of Rare Candies, Exp. Candies, and Dynamax Candies upon successful completion of the resulting raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to **Promotional Events** and serial code distributions (e.g., pre-order bonuses for the Sword & Shield Dual Pack). Once the code is redeemed and the item is used, it disappears from the inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these crystals represent concentrated Galar particles tuned to a specific Pokémon's frequency, making them unique "keys" to the Power Spots found within the region.
* **World Knowledge:** In the context of the Galar region, the Watchtower Lair is unique because it remains inactive unless a Dynamax Crystal is dropped into it, making this item the only way to "unlock" that specific raid den.
