## Identity & Utility
**Balm Mushroom** is a **Loot/Valuable** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A rare, fragrant mushroom primarily used as a high-value trade commodity. Unlike standard mushrooms (like the Tiny Mushroom or Big Mushroom), the Balm Mushroom sits at the top of the "fungal loot" hierarchy. It is a **Consumable (Sellable)** item that **cannot** be bought from shops; it must be found or harvested.
* **Cost:** 15,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value Loot**). Note: In specific regions like Unova, it can be sold to specialized NPC collectors (e.g., the Hungry Maid) for a premium price of 25,000 Poké Dollars.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Balm Mushroom has no functional use in battle or the overworld. Its sole purpose is to be sold to vendors to accumulate wealth for expensive items like TMs, Vitamins, or specialized Poké Balls.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It is a "Vendor Trash" item. Holding this item in a competitive match provides no tactical advantage and is considered a wasted item slot.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Mushroom" item group, which includes Tiny Mushrooms and Big Mushrooms, but it provides the highest monetary return of the three.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as a hidden item using the **Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine** in damp, forest, or swampy environments (e.g., Pinwheel Forest, Lush Jungle). It is also rewarded in some games through high-level Raid Battles or specialized mini-games.
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild **Paras, Parasect, Foongus,** and **Amoonguss**. These items are most efficiently gathered using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or generated passively by Pokémon with the **Pickup** ability at very high levels (typically Level 71-100).
