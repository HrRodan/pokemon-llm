## Identity & Utility
**Machop Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with energy. Unlike generic Rare Candies or Exp. Candies, this item is tailored to the unique biological makeup of a specific evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item used in the overworld menu to provide permanent stat growth.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a low purchase price, it is rarely bought and instead primarily earned through gameplay mechanics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the **Machop, Machoke, or Machamp** evolutionary line, it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** through the **Awakening Value (AV)** system.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists in a game engine where the move Fling is not present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System Specific.** It is not used in standard Smogon or VGC formats (which use Effort Values/EVs). However, it is a **Mandatory Staple** for the *Let's Go* post-game "Master Trainer" challenges, as maximizing AVs is the only way to succeed in mirror matches.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly used for stat maximization. It bypasses the level-based stat caps, allowing a low-level Machop to have significantly higher stats than its wild counterparts.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is predominantly acquired in the Kanto region (LGPE) by:
    1. **Catching Machop:** Consistently catching Machop, especially during a Catch Combo.
    2. **Transferring:** Sending Machop, Machoke, or Machamp to **Professor Oak**.
    3. **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking with a Machop in the physical Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item in the wild. It is rewarded to the trainer as a byproduct of the "Catching" and "Researching" loops in the Kanto-Alola transition era.
