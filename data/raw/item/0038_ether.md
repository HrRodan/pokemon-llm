## Identity & Utility
**Ether** is a **PP-Recovery** medicine introduced in **Generation III** (per internal data) though it has been a staple of the series since Generation I.
* **Description:** A specialized medicine designed to replenish the energy of a Pokémon's move. It is a **Consumable** item that can be used both during battle to sustain an offensive and in the overworld to prepare for upcoming encounters. While it has an internal cost, it is famously known for being **unavailable for purchase** in standard Poké Marts throughout most regions.
* **Cost:** 1,200 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range price**, though effectively **Priceless/Rare** as it cannot typically be bought in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon, it **restores 10 PP** to a single selected move. This makes it an essential tool for Pokémon with low-PP, high-power moves (like Fire Blast or Hydro Pump).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides minimal damage and no secondary status effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Essential.** In standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon), consumable medicines are prohibited. However, in Nuzlocke challenges or "Gauntlet" style play, Ethers are high-value resources used to prevent Pokémon from being forced to use "Struggle" during long routes or the Elite Four.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is a target for the **Pickup** ability; in many games, high-level Pokémon with the Pickup ability can scavenge Ethers, providing a rare renewable source for this item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally found as "field items" (visible Poke Balls on the ground) or "hidden items" (detected via Itemfinder/Dowsing Mch). Because they cannot be bought, players must manage their Ether supply carefully during long dungeon crawls like Mt. Silver or Victory Road.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held** by wild Pokémon (0 recorded instances in this dataset), further increasing its scarcity. Players often rely on the **Pickup** ability or the **Cram-o-matic** (in later generations) to acquire multiples beyond those found in the overworld.
* **Tiering:** It sits as the entry-level PP recovery item, superior to none, but inferior to the **Max Ether** (full PP restoration for one move) and the **Elixir** (10 PP restoration for all four moves).
