## Identity & Utility
**Ice Gem** is a **Jewel** (Competitive Held Item) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A translucent gem infused with frozen essence. It is a **Single-use Consumable Held Item** that boosts the power of a specific move type. While it has a technical cost associated with it, it is typically not found in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, though its rarity in-game far exceeds its monetary value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging **Ice-type move**, the Ice Gem is consumed to increase that move's power by **1.5×** (Gen V mechanics). The boost is applied only once per battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Gems typically cannot be used effectively with Fling; they are consumed by their own mechanic first).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Tier-1 Competitive Staple** during the Generation V era (VGC 2011–2013). It allows a Pokémon to secure a specific One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) on threats like Garchomp or Landorus without the recoil of a Life Orb or the move-locking restriction of Choice items. It is particularly devastating when paired with priority moves like **Ice Shard** or high-accuracy moves to ensure a "nuke" turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Unburden:** Consuming the gem immediately activates the **Unburden** ability, doubling the user's speed.
    * **Acrobatics:** Once the gem is consumed, the user is considered to be holding no item, doubling the power of the move **Acrobatics**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Dust Clouds** in caves across the Unova region. In later generations, elemental gems (other than the Normal Gem) became significantly harder to obtain, often restricted to special events or specific battle facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon species. It must be scavenged from the environment or earned through battle challenges. This makes it a prized resource for competitive trainers looking for "one-off" offensive pressure.
