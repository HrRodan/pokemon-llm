## Identity & Utility
**Oval Stone** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A smooth, egg-shaped stone with a peculiar texture. Unlike traditional Evolution Stones that are "used" on a Pokémon, the Oval Stone is a **Held Item** that triggers evolution under specific conditions. It is a consumable item that is used up once the evolution process is complete.
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate; typically not found in standard Poké Marts and often requires special acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Happiny**, it enables evolution into **Chansey** upon leveling up during the **Daytime**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Strong). While it has no secondary Fling effect, its high base power makes it a surprisingly heavy projectile for a non-combat item.
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Non-existent. It is used strictly for pokedex completion and breeding progression. However, since it evolves Happiny into Chansey (a premier defensive wall in competitive singles), it is an essential tool for players building stall-based teams from scratch.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specific only to the **Happiny line**. It does not interact with other "egg-like" Pokémon such as Exeggcute or Togepi.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically found in the **Sinnoh Underground** and various rocky terrains across different regions. In many games, it is found as a hidden item or obtained through specific NPCs (like the Breeder at the Pokémon Nursery).
* **Wild Held Item:** Frequently carried by wild **Happiny** (typically a 50% chance), **Chansey**, and **Blissey** (typically a 5% chance). It is most efficiently gathered by using Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief**, or by using the **Pickup** ability at mid-to-high levels in specific titles.
* **Lore context:** Its physical resemblance to a Pokémon Egg is a thematic link to the Chansey family's role as caretakers of eggs and their high HP pools.
