## Identity & Utility
**Mewtwonite Y** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI** (Kalos region).
* **Description:** A mysterious, high-tier evolutionary mineral specific to the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo. When held by Mewtwo, it reacts with a Trainer's Key Stone to trigger Mega Evolution. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** or sold through standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). Its value is considered priceless as a unique artifact.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** During battle, if Mewtwo is holding this stone, it can undergo **Mega Evolution** to become **Mega Mewtwo Y**. This transformation significantly boosts Mewtwo’s Special Attack and Speed stats and changes its Ability to **Insomnia** (preventing sleep).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80. (Note: In competitive play, Mega Stones generally cannot be removed from the Pokémon by moves like Knock Off or Thief if held by the correct species, and Fling will fail if the Pokémon has already Mega Evolved).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Ubers Tier Staple.** Mega Mewtwo Y is one of the most powerful Special Attackers in the history of the franchise, reaching a base Special Attack of 194 and a Speed of 140. It is preferred over Mewtwonite X in teams requiring a "Glass Cannon" wall-breaker.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically coded to interact only with Mewtwo. It does not trigger a permanent evolution but a temporary mid-battle transformation that reverts once the battle ends or the Pokémon faints.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained as a late-game or post-game reward. 
    * In *Pokémon Y*, it is found in the **Unknown Dungeon** after capturing Mewtwo.
    * In *Pokémon Sun/Moon* and *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*, it is obtained from **Red** at the Battle Tree or via special distribution codes.
    * In *Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!*, it is purchased from the Stone Salesman at the Pokémon League after defeating the Elite Four.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a unique Legendary-tier item, it is never gathered via the **Pickup** ability or found on common wild encounters.
