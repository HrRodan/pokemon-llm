## Identity & Utility
**TM188 (Scald)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching device that grants a Pokémon the move **Scald**. As a Generation IX TM, it is a consumable item that can be replicated at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale). It is acquired through exploration in the Terarium or via crafting at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Scald** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Scald is a Water-type Special attack with **80 Power** and **100 Accuracy**. It has a significant **30% chance to Burn** the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (No additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Scald is widely considered one of the best moves in competitive Pokémon history. Its ability to inflict burns on physical attackers makes it a premier defensive and offensive utility move for bulky Water-types (e.g., Toxapex, Slowbro, Milotic). Its reintroduction in *The Indigo Disk* shifted the meta by providing reliable burn spread.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Water-type Pokémon and select non-Water types that have access to "steam" or "hot water" themes.
