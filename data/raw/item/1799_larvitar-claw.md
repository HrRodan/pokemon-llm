## Identity & Utility
**Larvitar Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Larvitar evolutionary line. It is classified as a crafting resource used specifically at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. As a specialized ingredient, it is a **Consumable** item that is not intended for direct use in battle or on a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a sell value, its primary "currency" value lies in its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use as a component in move-teaching recipes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a fundamental ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines. It is consumed alongside League Points to produce high-impact moves, typically of the Rock or Ground type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Direct) / Essential (Indirect).** While the claw itself provides no tactical advantage in a fight, it is vital for the competitive circuit to craft TMs such as **TM086 (Rock Slide)** and **TM150 (Stone Edge)**, which are staples in VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a material harvested from the Larvitar line (Larvitar, Pupitar, and Tyranitar).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop in the **Paldea** region. It is automatically added to the player's inventory after defeating or catching wild members of the Larvitar family.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not traditionally "held" by wild Pokémon in the classic sense; rather, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop upon the conclusion of an encounter with wild **Larvitar**, **Pupitar**, or **Tyranitar**. It is commonly farmed in rocky or mountainous biomes where these Pokémon reside.
