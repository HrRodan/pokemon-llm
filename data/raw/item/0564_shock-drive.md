## Identity & Utility
**Shock Drive** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech cassette module designed specifically for the Mythical Pokémon Genesect. It is a specialized held item that cannot be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts. When equipped, it physically alters Genesect's model by changing the light on its back-mounted cannon to yellow.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; typically acquired through special events or specific NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Genesect**, the move **Techno Blast** changes its type from Normal to **Electric**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Deals physical damage but results in the permanent loss of the drive for the remainder of the battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Situational. In tiers where Genesect is permitted (such as Smogon Ubers), the Shock Drive is rarely the first choice compared to the Chill Drive (Ice) or Douse Drive (Water), as Electric coverage is often redundant with Genesect's ability to learn Thunderbolt. However, it can be used to lure and OHKO specific threats like Primal Kyogre or Ho-Oh in specific historical metas.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of four "Drive" items (including Burn, Chill, and Douse) that exclusively interact with Genesect's signature mechanics and form-dependent move.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained via a scripted event or NPC interaction. In the Unova region, it is given to the player at the **P2 Laboratory** after showing a Genesect to a specific scientist. In subsequent generations, it is often found in locations associated with fossils or high-tech research (e.g., the Fossil Lab in Kalos or from the Gladion/Aether Foundation in Alola).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made object created by **Team Plasma** scientists during the modification of the ancient Paleozoic Pokémon.
