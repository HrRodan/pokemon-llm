## Identity & Utility
**LA Poké Ball** (Hisuian Poké Ball) is a **Standard-Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** A primitive, hand-crafted device used for catching wild Pokémon in the ancient Hisui region. Unlike modern Poké Balls, it is constructed largely of wood and features a steam-venting mechanism upon a successful capture. It is a **Consumable Poké Ball** that is primarily acquired through crafting rather than traditional modern retail.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it can be purchased for 100 Poké Dollars at the Jubilife Village General Store, the 0-cost designation in the metadata reflects its status as a craftable item and its absence from standard Poké Marts in other regions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A device for catching wild Pokémon. It provides a **1x Catch Rate multiplier**, making it the baseline tool for Survey Corps members. In its native environment (*Legends: Arceus*), it must be manually aimed and thrown at Pokémon in the overworld.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with Fling in its debut title; when transferred to modern games via Pokémon HOME, it functions as a decorative housing for the Pokémon).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Cosmetic.** In competitive play (VGC/Smogon), the LA Poké Ball provides no mechanical advantage. Its value is strictly aesthetic, signaling that the Pokémon was caught in the Hisui region.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is the foundation for the Hisuian crafting tree. It is crafted using **1 Apricorn** and **1 Tumblestone**. It does not trigger any known Pokémon evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Hisui region**. It is the first Poké Ball provided to the player by Professor Laventon. It can be crafted at any workbench or via a Portable Crafting Kit.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made (though primitive) tool. In the lore of the Hisui region, these balls are considered relatively new technology, replacing older, less reliable methods of interacting with wild creatures. When a Pokémon caught in this ball is transferred to a modern setting (Generation IX), the ball retains its unique wooden appearance.
