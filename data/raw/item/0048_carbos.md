## Identity & Utility
**Carbos** is a **Vitamin (Consumable Medicine)** introduced in **Generation I** (represented in this dataset via Generation IV).
* **Description:** A highly nutritious, specialized drink designed for Pokémon consumption. It functions as a permanent stat-booster that increases a Pokémon's Speed base points (Effort Values). It is a **consumable** item that can be used from the bag both in the overworld and during battle (though battle use is rare and typically only for friendship gains).
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point reflects its status as a premium shortcut for professional Pokémon training.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed, Carbos increases a Pokémon's **Speed Effort Values (EVs) by 10**. 
    * **EV Cap:** In legacy titles (Gen 1–7), it cannot be used if the Pokémon already has 100 or more Speed EVs. In modern titles (Gen 8+), this cap is removed, allowing players to reach the 252 EV maximum solely through vitamins.
    * **Friendship/Happiness:** Using Carbos also increases the Pokémon’s happiness level by 5, 3, or 2 points depending on the current friendship tier.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Utility.** While not held during battle, Carbos is a foundational item for competitive preparation. It is the primary method for "EV Training" fast attackers (Sweepers) like Jolteon or Dragapult, allowing them to outspeed threats without the need for manual grinding against wild Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Carbos is often used to quickly trigger happiness-based evolutions (e.g., Buneary to Lopunny) while simultaneously optimizing the Pokémon's stat spread.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually purchased at major **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon City, Goldenrod City, Lilycove City) or from specialized **BP (Battle Point) Shops** in post-game facilities like the Battle Frontier or Battle Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through purchase, found as hidden "balls" in the overworld, or gathered via the **Pickup** ability at high levels (typically Level 71-100 depending on the game version).
* **Nuzlocke Context:** Extremely valuable in Nuzlocke challenges for "speed-creeping"—ensuring your Pokémon acts first to avoid taking lethal damage, though the high cost requires significant financial management.
