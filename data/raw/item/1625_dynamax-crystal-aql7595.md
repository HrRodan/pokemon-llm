## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQL7595** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A single-use promotional item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. It acts as a beacon to summon a specific Max Raid Battle encounter. While the internal data lists a nominal cost, it is a **Special Acquisition** item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. This specific crystal (AQL7595) is used to encounter **Gigantamax Sandaconda**. The encounter remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle; it is an overworld utility item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** The item itself has no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon). However, it is a reliable method for obtaining a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was historically relevant in the Generation VIII VGC meta for its unique G-Max Move, **G-Max Sandblast**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in the Galar Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was a **limited-time event distribution**. It was primarily released via serial codes through retail partnerships (such as GAME in the UK or GameStop/Best Buy in the US) to promote the *Sword & Shield* expansions.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Context:** Dynamax Crystals served as a bridge between retail promotion and in-game content, allowing players to access rare Gigantamax encounters without relying on the low spawn rates of standard Max Raid Dens. This specific variant (AQL7595) ensured a 5-star encounter with Sandaconda, providing a high-IV catch opportunity.
