## Identity & Utility
**Avocado** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A sliced green fruit used as a filling during the Picnic sandwich-making mini-game. It is a **Consumable Ingredient** that is primarily used to influence Meal Powers. It cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 180 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich, Avocado contributes specific values toward **Meal Powers**. In the Paldean culinary system, Avocado is a key component for boosting **Dragon-type** attributes. It provides a significant increase to **EXP Point Power (Dragon)** and **Catching Power (Dragon)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Meta-Utility Only).** While it has no impact on ranked VGC or Smogon battles, it is vital for the "metagame" of training, providing a low-cost way to increase Experience Gain for Dragon-type Pokémon or to facilitate Shiny Hunting through Sparkling Power recipes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting component for the Sandwich mechanic and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at specialized grocery retailers in the Paldea region, specifically **Sure Cans** and **Aquiesta Supermarket**. It is available early in the player's journey, making it a staple for early-to-mid-game Dragon-type training.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or occasionally received as a reward from NPC trainers or Raid completions.
