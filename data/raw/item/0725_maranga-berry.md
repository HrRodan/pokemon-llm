## Identity & Utility
**Maranga Berry** is a **Stat-Boosting Consumable Berry** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A held item that triggers a defensive boost upon taking specific damage. If held by a Pokémon, it is consumed to raise the holder's Special Defense when struck by a special move. As a Berry, it is a one-time use consumable in battle.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though typically obtained through cultivation rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder is hit by a **Special Attack**, the Maranga Berry is consumed, and the Pokémon’s **Special Defense is increased by one stage (+1)**. This effect activates after the damage is dealt.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the Sp. Def boost on the target if flung).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with Natural Gift, it becomes a **Dark-type** move with **100 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** While niche compared to Sitrus or Lum Berries, the Maranga Berry is a staple in specific defensive setups. It is often paired with the **Harvest** ability (to repeatedly boost Sp. Def) or the **Unburden** ability (triggering a massive speed boost once the berry is consumed). It serves as the Special Defense counterpart to the Kee Berry.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts negatively with the **Klutz** ability (prevents use) and is susceptible to **Unnerve** (prevents consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (X/Y), it was primarily obtained through **Berry Mutation** by cross-breeding Tanga and Kasib berries. In later generations, it is found in high-tier Berry Piles or special giveaway trees (e.g., Alola Route 10 or the Wild Area in Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition relies on the player's gardening efforts, the **Pickup** ability in specific level brackets, or foraging in designated berry locations.
