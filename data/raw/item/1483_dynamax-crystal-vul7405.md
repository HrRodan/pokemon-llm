## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (vul7405)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When brought to the **Watchtower Lair** (located at the Ruins of Watchtower), it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Inaccessible**). While it has a nominal internal price of 20, it is effectively "Priceless" as it is obtained via external distributions rather than currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon use at the Watchtower Lair, a pillar of light appears, initiating a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (in this case, typically a Gigantamax-capable Pokémon like **Sandaconda** based on the internal ID). Defeating the Pokémon allows the player an opportunity to catch it and rewards various Raid treasures (TRs, Exp. Candies, etc.).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a world-map utility item. However, it is highly valued by competitive players and collectors for providing guaranteed access to specific **Gigantamax** forms or Pokémon with Hidden Abilities that are otherwise rare or time-locked.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but facilitates the acquisition of Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which is required for certain species to change form when Dynamaxing.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals are typically distributed as **Event Items** through serial codes, pre-order bonuses (such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack), or special retail tie-ins. They are not found during normal gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. This is an "Event/Key" utility item that bypasses the standard RNG of the Max Raid Den system, ensuring a specific encounter regardless of the current weather or natural den rotations.
