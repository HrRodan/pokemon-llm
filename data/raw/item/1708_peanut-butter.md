## Identity & Utility
**Peanut Butter** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A smooth and savory condiment used as a core ingredient during Picnics. It is a **Consumable** item used specifically for the Sandwich-making mini-game to grant Meal Powers to the player and their party. It can be bought in bulk from specific retail outlets.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Peanut Butter adds specific values to **Meal Powers**. It is a primary component for recipes targeting **Egg Power**, **Exp. Point Power**, and **Raid Power**. It contributes heavily to the "Sweet" and "Salty" flavor profiles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients typically cannot be held or used in formal battles).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Battle)** / **High (Meta-Utility)**. While it has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, it is essential for the "Great Peanut Butter Sandwich" recipe, which is a low-cost method for obtaining **Egg Power Lv. 2**, making it a staple for competitive breeders and Masuda Method hunters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts solely with the Gen IX Picnic mechanics and the Sandwich physics engine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Sure Cans** and **Aquiesta Supermarket** locations throughout the Paldea region. It becomes available early in the game, usually after the player has obtained their first Gym Badge.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, this is a processed culinary good that must be purchased or found as a sparkling item on the ground in specific "picnic" themed areas.
