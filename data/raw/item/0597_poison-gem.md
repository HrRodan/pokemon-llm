## Identity & Utility
**Poison Gem** is a **Jewel** (Gem) introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A single-use, consumable held item infused with toxic essence. It acts as a one-time damage modifier for Poison-type attacks. As a "Jewel" category item, it is consumed immediately upon activation.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though rarely sold in standard Poké Marts; usually found via exploration).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder uses a damaging **Poison-type** move, the move's power is increased by **1.5×** (in Generation V) and the item is consumed. In subsequent generations where elemental gems appear in the code, the modifier is reduced to **1.3×**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item is typically consumed by its own effect before Fling can be utilized; standard Gem data assigns them a Fling power of 0).
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically a "Niche Nuke." In Gen V competitive play (VGC '11-'12), elemental gems were staples for securing specific One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs). Poison Gem is less common than other types due to Poison's limited offensive coverage, but it is a potent trigger for the **Unburden** ability, allowing a Pokémon to double its speed the moment it attacks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Consumption of this item successfully activates the **Acrobatics** move's double-damage condition and triggers abilities like **Unburden** (Speed boost) or **Magician** (allows the user to steal a replacement item).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through **Dust Clouds** in caves (Unova region). It is not available for purchase in most mainline games, making it a rare find through environmental RNG or specialized Battle Frontier/Subway vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. In the Unova region, it must be "farmed" by entering caves and looking for swirling dust shadows, which may also contain evolution stones or fossils.
