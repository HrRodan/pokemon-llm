## Identity & Utility
**Flower Sweet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** A decorative, flower-shaped confection specifically designed for the Pokémon Milcery. It functions as a specialized evolution trigger that a Pokémon must hold to facilitate a transformation based on the trainer's movements. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that is relatively inexpensive but often restricted in availability to specific vendors or RNG-based rewards.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**, though often obtained through gameplay challenges rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Milcery**, the Flower Sweet allows the Pokémon to evolve into **Alcremie**. The evolution is triggered when the player performs a "Spin" (rapidly rotating the joystick) in the overworld. The Flower Sweet becomes the permanent decorative topping on the resulting Alcremie's head.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). It provides no secondary status effects when thrown.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Aesthetic.** The item has no utility in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon; its value is entirely cosmetic, determining the "Flower" decoration of the Alcremie.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is one of seven "Sweets" used to evolve Milcery. The combination of the Sweet, the time of day, the direction of the spin, and the duration of the spin determines which of the 63 possible Alcremie forms is achieved.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region (Sword/Shield), it is primarily obtained as a random reward for defeating the masters of **Battle Cafés** (located in Motostoke, Hammerlocke, and Wyndon) once per day. In later generations (Scarlet/Violet), it can be obtained via the **Cram-o-matic** or as a reward from the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a man-made delicacy and is typically gathered through **Battle Café challenges** or specialized crafting mechanics.
