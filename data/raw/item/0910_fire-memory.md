## Identity & Utility
**Fire Memory** is a specialized **Memory** item introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola region).
* **Description:** A high-tech memory disc containing Fire-type data. It is a **Competitive Held Item** designed specifically for use with a single evolutionary line. While it has a listed cost, it is technically a unique utility item that cannot typically be purchased in bulk from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Moderately priced, though usually acquired as part of a complete set through specialized NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Silvally**, the Fire Memory changes Silvally’s type to **Fire**. Additionally, it changes the type of Silvally's signature move, **Multi-Attack**, to Fire-type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 50 (Standard physical damage; the memory is consumed if Fling is used, which is generally detrimental as it reverts Silvally to its Normal-type form).
    * **Competitive Use:** Niche/Tier-Dependent. In competitive formats (Smogon/VGC), Fire-type Silvally is used as a versatile attacker or pivot. It provides Silvally with a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) 120-base power physical move in Multi-Attack. However, it is often outclassed by dedicated Fire-types because the item slot is "locked," preventing the use of items like Life Orb or Heavy-Duty Boots.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is essential for activating the **RKS System** ability. Without a Memory item, Silvally remains a Normal-type. It does not affect any Pokémon other than Silvally.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically obtained as a set of all 17 Memories. In *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon*, it is given to the player by **Gladion** at the Aether House or Aether Paradise. In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, it is obtained from an NPC in the Battle Tower after being gifted a Type: Null.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is an artificial, man-made item created by the Aether Foundation to stabilize the "Beast Killer" project (Type: Null).
* **Role-Play Context:** The Fire Memory represents the successful replication of the Arceus "Plate" mechanic using human technology, allowing Silvally to adapt to specific combat needs.
