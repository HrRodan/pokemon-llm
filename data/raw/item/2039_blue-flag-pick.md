## Identity & Utility
**Blue-flag-pick** is a **Picnic Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A small, decorative pick featuring a blue flag design used to secure ingredients when crafting sandwiches during a Picnic. It is a **Consumable** item that is required to finalize the sandwich-making process.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used during the Sandwich-making mini-game in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. Once all ingredients and seasonings are placed on the bread, the player must insert a pick to complete the sandwich. The pick is consumed upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no impact on competitive battling (VGC/Smogon) and is strictly a mechanic for the Picnic system to generate Meal Powers (e.g., Sparkling Power, Egg Power).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is a functional component of the Sandwich system which provides temporary buffs to the player, such as increased Shiny encounter rates or EXP gains.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at specialized food and supply vendors throughout the Paldea region, most notably at **Sure Cans**, **Deli Cioso**, and **Every Wich Way** locations.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or certain hold items, these are mass-produced commercial goods intended for trainers' picnic kits.
