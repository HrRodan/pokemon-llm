## Identity & Utility
**TR95** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** It is a single-use consumable move-teaching item that teaches the move **Throat Chop**. Unlike the TMs of its debut generation, Technical Records are consumed upon use and must be re-acquired to teach the move to additional Pokémon. 
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderately Expensive; typically purchased using Watts in its debut region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Throat Chop**, a Physical Dark-type attack with a base power of 80 and 100% accuracy. The move deals damage and prevents the target from using any sound-based moves (such as *Hyper Voice*, *Perish Song*, or *Boomburst*) for two turns.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Deals significant physical damage when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** A staple coverage and utility move in competitive formats (VGC and Smogon). It is highly valued for Physical Dark-type attackers who need a reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. Its secondary effect is a hard counter to Pokémon that rely on sound-based moves, such as Sylveon or Toxtricity.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide variety of Pokémon, primarily those with a physical attacking bias or a "ruthless" lore profile (e.g., Incineroar, Weavile, and Urshifu).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR95 is primarily acquired by defeating Dark-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area. It can also be generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is an artificial data record synthesized for Galar's league training system.
