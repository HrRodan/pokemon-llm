## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Atk 6** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An advanced, specialized battle item designed to maximize a Pokémon's offensive potential instantly. Unlike standard battle items, this is a **Consumable Battle Item** restricted entirely to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic. It cannot be used in standard overworld play or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired exclusively through the accumulation of points during Wonder Launcher-enabled battles.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a Pokémon in battle, it raises the target’s **Special Attack stat by six stages**. This instantly brings the Pokémon to the maximum possible offensive multiplier (+300% or 4x damage) for its special moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** This item is exclusive to Generation V (Black, White, Black 2, and White 2) multiplayer battles where the "Wonder Launcher" setting is toggled on. It is not used in standard Smogon tiers or modern VGC, as the Wonder Launcher mechanic was retired after Gen V.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. The stat boost follows standard battle rules: the effect is lost if the Pokémon switches out or the battle ends.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is unique to the **Wonder Launcher** system in the Unova region. Players earn points over the course of a battle and "buy" this item mid-match to turn the tide. Because it costs a high number of points, it is considered the "Ultimate" version of the X Special Attack line.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found on wild Pokémon**. It does not exist as a physical item in the player's inventory bag in the same way a Potion or Poké Ball does; it is a digital manifestation within the Wonder Launcher interface.
