## Identity & Utility
**TM174** (Haze) is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This machine teaches the move **Haze** to compatible Pokémon. In the Generation IX ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale at standard marts; requires crafting or exploration to acquire).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Haze**. When used in battle, Haze creates a black mist that eliminates all stat changes for every Pokémon on the field (both allies and opponents). This includes buffs and debuffs to Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** In competitive formats like VGC and Smogon singles, TM174 is essential for "Haze-users" (such as Toxapex, Milotic, or Murkrow). It is the primary counter-play against setup sweepers that rely on moves like Swords Dance, Calm Mind, or Dragon Dance. It is also a hard counter to the "Dondozo/Tatsugiri" Commander strategy in double battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the overworld of the **Paldea** region or the **Blueberry Academy** (Indigo Disk). Once obtained, it can be crafted at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** In *Scarlet & Violet*, crafting TM174 requires:
    * **3,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3 Quaxly Down**
    * **3 Surskit Syrup**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials required for its creation are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Quaxly** and **Surskit**.
