## Identity & Utility
**TM121 (Heavy Slam)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach the move **Heavy Slam** to a compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumables that can be manufactured at a TM Machine. It is a **Consumable** item that **cannot be bought** with standard Poké Dollars but must be crafted or found.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It requires **3,000 LP (League Points)** and specific Pokémon materials to create.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Heavy Slam**. This is a Steel-type physical move where the user slams into the target with its heavy body. The power of the move is calculated based on the weight of the user relative to the target:
    * **120 BP:** If user's weight is > 5× target's weight.
    * **100 BP:** If user's weight is > 4× target's weight.
    * **80 BP:** If user's weight is > 3× target's weight.
    * **60 BP:** If user's weight is > 2× target's weight.
    * **40 BP:** If user's weight is ≤ 2× target's weight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with Fling in Gen IX).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Niche/Tactical staple** for extremely heavy Pokémon like **Iron Hands**, **Copperajah**, or **Heatran**. It is particularly devastating against lightweight Fairy-types (e.g., Flutter Mane, Mimikyu), often reaching its maximum 120 Base Power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a critical component of the "Heavy" archetype in VGC and Smogon formats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a physical TM item in the overworld of the **Paldea Region** or the **Terarium** (Indigo Disk). Once found, the recipe is unlocked at the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To manufacture TM121, the player must provide:
    * **3,000 LP**
    * **3x Bronzor Fragments**
    * **3x Cufant Tarnish**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon; materials are gathered by defeating wild **Bronzor** and **Cufant** lines.
