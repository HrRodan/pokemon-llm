## Identity & Utility
**Ditto Goo** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological byproduct dropped by Ditto. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that serves as a currency for the TM Machine. While it cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon to gain an advantage, it is a vital resource for move-pool expansion.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (Standard Material value; can be exchanged for League Points/LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. It acts as a specific ingredient required to craft various Technical Machines (TMs). 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Materials cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Indirect Utility.** While useless in a live match, Ditto Goo is essential for competitive preparation. It is a required ingredient for crafting high-tier competitive TMs, most notably **TM103 (Substitute)**, which is a staple move in both VGC and Smogon singles formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly categorized as a "treasure/material" and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a traditional held-item capacity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Ditto**. In the Paldea region, these are commonly found in West Province (Area Two) and West Province (Area Three).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item does not occupy a hold slot. Instead, it is awarded as a guaranteed drop (1–3 units) upon the conclusion of an encounter with a Ditto.
* **Farming Context:** Because Ditto often disguise themselves as other Pokémon (like Zorua or common spawns), players must use the "Target" (ZL) function in the overworld to identify Ditto and farm this material efficiently for move crafting.
