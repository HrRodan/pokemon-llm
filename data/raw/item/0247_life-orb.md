## Identity & Utility
**Life Orb** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** An offensive powerhouse item designed for "glass cannon" builds. It provides a significant boost to the power of all attacking moves at the cost of the user's longevity. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that remains permanently equipped during battle unless removed by specific moves like Knock Off or Thief.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate to Expensive). In most core series games, it is rarely bought with standard currency and is instead obtained through high-level Battle Facilities (Battle Tower/Frontier) using Battle Points (BP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The holder's damaging moves deal **30% more damage (1.3x multiplier)**. However, every time the holder successfully hits an opponent with a damaging move, they lose **10% of their maximum HP** as recoil damage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effect upon Flinging).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Top-Tier Competitive Staple** in both VGC and Smogon formats. It is the preferred item for versatile sweepers and mixed attackers who need a power boost without being locked into a single move (unlike Choice items).
    * **Advanced Synergies:**
        * **Magic Guard:** Pokémon with this ability (e.g., Alakazam, Reuniclus) gain the 30% power boost but **take no recoil damage**.
        * **Sheer Force:** If a move's secondary effect is stripped by Sheer Force (e.g., Nidoking using Ice Beam), the Life Orb recoil is negated while the damage boost remains.
        * **Multi-hit Moves:** The recoil is only applied once per turn, even if a move hits multiple times (e.g., Scale Shot).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in late-game or post-game locations such as **Stark Mountain** (Gen IV) or the **Victory Road**. It is most commonly acquired via the **Battle Subways, Battle Maison, or Battle Tree** exchange services.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is exceptionally rare in the wild but has been documented as being held by wild **Absol** and **Mega Absol** (in specific event or encounter contexts). Due to its rarity, players often use the **Compound Eyes** ability to increase the chance of finding it on wild encounters or **Pickup** at very high levels (though Life Orb is rarely in the Pickup table).
