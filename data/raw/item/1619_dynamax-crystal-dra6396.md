## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA6396)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, event-specific consumable item used in the Wild Area of the Galar region. It is specifically designed to be used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an otherwise inactive den) to trigger a Max Raid Battle. It is technically categorized as a consumable, though its "cost" is a nominal 20 Poké Dollars.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this item is typically acquired via special distribution rather than a shop).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal ID DRA6396) to appear as a Dynamax boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility/event item used exclusively in the overworld to facilitate Max Raid Battles. It has no application in VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** landmark in the Wild Area, converting the "empty" den into an active pillar of light for a cooperative raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of pre-order bonuses, retail promotions (such as those from GameStop or Pokémon Center), or magazine tie-ins (like CoroCoro). Once the code is redeemed, the item appears in the player's "Other Items" pocket.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a strictly promotional/special acquisition item.
* **Context:** In the lore of *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, Dynamax Crystals are concentrated fragments of Galar Particles that can force a den to activate regardless of the current weather or standard raid rotations, allowing players to target specific rare or Gigantamax encounters.
