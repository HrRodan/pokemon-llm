## Identity & Utility
**Dragon Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A mysterious, crystalline fragment of a Tera Jewel. It is a consumable resource used to alter the fundamental Terastal energy of a Pokémon. Unlike standard medicines, it is a specialized currency for mid-to-late-game customization.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap; however, this represents its resale value, as they are primarily earned through gameplay rather than purchased at standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Dragon Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded to the chef at the Treasure Eatery in Medali to change a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to **Dragon**. This process consumes the shards.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta-Relevance.** Changing a Pokémon's Tera Type to Dragon is a staple strategy in VGC and Smogon formats. It is frequently used defensively to grant resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric, or offensively to provide a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) boost to powerful moves like *Draco Meteor* or *Glaive Rush*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is a mechanical item specifically tied to the **Terastal Phenomenon** and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz for battle utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for defeating **Dragon-type Tera Raid Battles** (3-star rarity or higher). They are also found as rare sparkling pickups in the overworld (notably in **Area Zero**) and as rewards from the Academy Ace Tournament or the Ogre Oustin' minigame in Kitakami.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is strictly tied to Raid participation or environmental exploration.
