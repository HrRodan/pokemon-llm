## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (cyg7796)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive consumable item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to trigger. It is a single-use mission item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Symbolic; this value is a placeholder as the item is primarily distributed via serial codes and cannot be bought at Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-area of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Centiskorch**—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a progression/encounter item. However, it is highly valued by collectors and competitive players for providing guaranteed access to a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was historically required for specific G-Max moves in VGC (Video Game Championships) before the introduction of Max Soup in the *Isle of Armor* DLC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It strictly interacts with the Max Raid Den mechanics of the Galar Wild Area. It bypasses the need for Wishing Pieces at the specific Watchtower location.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (often referred to in distribution logs by its code "Andbe-71" or associated with specific retail promotions) was made available via **Serial Code events**. It is not found through natural gameplay or Mart vendors.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is an external catalyst for Max Raid encounters and cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief.
