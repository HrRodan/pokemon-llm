## Identity & Utility
**Tinkatink Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed by members of the Tinkatink evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for small amounts of currency or converted into League Points (LP) at the TM Machine. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for an effect.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Material value; primarily used as a reagent rather than a purchased commodity).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as a component at the **TM Machine** found at Pokémon Centers. It is required to craft specific Technical Machines (TMs) that teach moves to Pokémon.
* **Crafting Applications:** 
    * Typically required for TMs such as **TM082 (Thunder Wave)**, **TM098 (Skill Swap)**, **TM122 (Encore)**, and **TM161 (Trick Room)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is entirely external to the battle sequence, serving as a progression and customization tool for building competitive movesets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM Machine system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Tinkatink family.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense for battle, it is consistently "dropped" by:
    * **Tinkatink**
    * **Tinkatuff**
    * **Tinkaton**
* **Lore Context:** In the Paldea region, materials like Tinkatink Hair represent the ecological footprints of Pokémon. Tinkatink are known for their metalworking and protective nature; the hair is a byproduct of their presence in ruins and rocky habitats where they scavenge for hammer materials. Often gathered efficiently through the **Let's Go!** auto-battle mechanic.
