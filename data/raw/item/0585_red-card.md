## Identity & Utility
**Red Card** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A single-use disruptive tool held by a Pokémon. When the holder is struck by a direct damaging attack and survives, the item is consumed to forcibly eject the attacker from the field. It is a **Consumable Held Item** that can be purchased in specialized shops.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Mid-range; often associated with Battle Point exchanges or post-game shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder takes direct damage from a move (and does not faint), the attacking Pokémon is forced to switch out for a random, non-fainted Pokémon in the opponent's party. This effect "phazes" (pseudo-hazes) the opponent, resetting any stat changes they may have accumulated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling consumes the item without triggering its primary forced-switch effect.
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Niche Competitive Staple**. It is primarily used to disrupt "Set-up Sweepers" (Pokémon using moves like Dragon Dance or Shell Smash). It is frequently seen on bulky "Lead" Pokémon or "Suicide Leads" that set up entry hazards, as the Red Card forces the opponent to switch into those hazards immediately.
* **Constraints:** 
    * The effect will **not** activate if the holder faints from the hit.
    * It does not trigger on indirect damage (e.g., Poison, Burn, Sandstorm, or Entry Hazards).
    * It will not activate if the opponent is under the effect of moves or abilities that prevent switching (e.g., Ingrain or Suction Cups).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through Battle Facilities (such as the Battle Subway, PWT, or Battle Maison) for Battle Points (BP), or purchased at specialized late-game boutiques/marts for 4,000 Poké Dollars.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** naturally held by wild Pokémon. It must be obtained through shops or specific overworld locations, making it a regulated tool for professional trainers rather than a naturally occurring resource.
