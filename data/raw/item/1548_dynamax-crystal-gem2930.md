## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Gem2930** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive consumable item used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area). Upon use, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While it has a defined price in the data, it is not sold in Poké Marts; the low cost prevents high resale value and acts as a placeholder for event distribution items.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair causes a specific Pokémon—specifically **Centiskorch (Gigantamax Form)**—to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The raid is accessible regardless of the natural den rotations or current weather conditions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it is used exclusively in the overworld).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Event Driven.** While the item itself has no competitive battle effect, it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon possessing the Gigantamax factor, which was essential for competitive VGC play prior to the introduction of Max Soup in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It interacts strictly with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area. Once used, the crystal is consumed, and the raid remains active until defeated or until midnight.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal (Gem2930) was primarily distributed via **special serial codes** (often associated with retail promotions, such as those through Amazon or local game hobbyist magazines). It is not available through standard progression or the Cram-o-matic.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Acquisition" item, meant to bridge the gap between real-world promotions and in-game encounters.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are concentrated shards of Galar Particle energy. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which attract random Pokémon to any den, a Gem crystal acts as a beacon for a specific, powerful entity to manifest in the ancient ruins of the Watchtower.
