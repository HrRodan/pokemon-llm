## Identity & Utility
**Big Mushroom** is a **Loot** item introduced in the earlier generations (formalized in this dataset under Generation IV).
* **Description:** A large, rare mushroom highly prized by specialized collectors. It is a **Consumable/Exchange** item that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts, as it serves primarily as a high-value trade or sale object.
* **Cost:** 5,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/High-Value Loot**). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In most regions, its primary purpose is "vendor trash," meaning it is intended to be sold for a high price (typically 2,500 to 5,000 Poké Dollars) to generate funds for the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It serves no tactical purpose in battle and provides no passive benefits when held. It is strictly a resource for the game's economy or specific NPCs.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Move Tutor (Historical):** In *FireRed* and *LeafGreen*, the Big Mushroom (along with Tiny Mushrooms) acted as a currency for the Move Maniac in Two Island, who required one Big Mushroom to help a Pokémon remember a previously learned move.
    * **Specialized Buyers:** In certain generations, specific NPCs (like the Hungry Maid or Gourmet Maniacs) may purchase this item for its full 5,000 Poké Dollar value, which is higher than the standard sell price at a Mart.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually found as hidden items on the ground in forested or damp areas (e.g., Viridian Forest, Petalburg Woods). It is often discovered using the Itemfinder or Dowsing Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is a signature held item for fungal-themed Pokémon. It can be farmed from wild **Paras, Parasect, Shroomish, Breloom, Foongus, Amoonguss, Morelull,** and **Shiinotic**. 
* **Farming Tip:** Players frequently use Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability and the move **Thief** to harvest these from wild mushroom Pokémon, or rely on the **Pickup** ability to find them after battles in certain level brackets.
