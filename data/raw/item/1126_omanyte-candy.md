## Identity & Utility
**Omanyte Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy, tailored specifically for the Omanyte evolutionary line. It is a consumable medicine used in the overworld to permanently enhance a Pokémon's performance.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Minimal Resale Value). While it has a nominal cost, it is primarily obtained through gameplay actions rather than purchased from a Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to an **Omanyte** or **Omastar**, it increases all of their stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by 1 point. This contributes to the **Awakened Value (AV)** system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Not applicable to traditional VGC or Smogon formats. However, it is **essential for post-game Master Trainer battles** in *Let's Go*, where maximizing AVs is required to overcome high-level opponents.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the limitations of standard stat-specific candies (like Quick Candy or Mighty Candy) by boosting every attribute at once, making it the most efficient way to maximize an Omanyte's potential.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusive to the Kanto region in *Let's Go*. It cannot be bought; it is earned through the following methods:
    * **Catching Omanyte:** Successfully capturing wild Omanyte (found in Seafoam Islands or via Fossil revival).
    * **Transferring:** Sending Omanyte to Professor Oak yields species-specific candies.
    * **Poké Ball Plus:** Walking an Omanyte in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a reward for the "Catch Em All" gameplay loop, incentivizing repeated captures of the same species to farm resources for stat maximization.
