## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Gem 2473)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, event-exclusive consumable used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use event item that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay channels.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal value; effectively **Not for sale** in standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific Pokémon Den in the Galar Wild Area), it forces a Max Raid Battle with a designated Pokémon to appear. This allows players to encounter specific species or forms (often those with Hidden Abilities or Gigantamax factors) that may not be currently active in the standard raid rotation.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for catching Pokémon and obtaining Raid rewards; it has no utility in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics. Once the crystal is used, the raid beacon at the Watchtower Lair turns a unique color to indicate an active event raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Special Events**, **Retailer Promotions** (such as pre-order bonuses for Pokémon Sword and Shield), or official serial codes. It is not available for purchase at Poke Marts or from standard NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly managed as a promotional distribution item.
