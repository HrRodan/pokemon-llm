## Identity & Utility
**Magma-stone** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** A dense stone formed from boulders that melted in intense heat and subsequently hardened, trapping magma within. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or given to a Pokémon to hold in a traditional battle sense.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique artifact acquired through story progression.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Magma Stone serves as a catalytic trigger for legendary encounters. Specifically, it is used to awaken or cause the Legendary Pokémon **Heatran** to appear at **Reversal Mountain** (in Pokémon Black 2 and White 2). While it existed in the game code in earlier Generation IV games (Sinnoh), its primary functional use for an encounter was formalized in the Unova sequels.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held or used during a match. Its value is strictly limited to the overworld and Pokédex completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. It acts exclusively as a "flag" or "trigger" for the Heatran encounter script.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Sinnoh region, it is tied to the **Stark Mountain** sub-plot. In the Unova region (Black 2/White 2), it is found in **Route 18** and must be taken to the deepest part of **Reversal Mountain** to initiate the battle with Heatran.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique world-spawn item or a gift from an NPC related to the game's lore.
* **Lore Context:** The stone is deeply connected to the volcanic activity of regions like Sinnoh and Unova, representing the dormant but powerful volcanic energy that Heatran embodies. In the anime and certain game iterations, it is often seen as a seal that keeps a volcano's power—or Heatran itself—stable.
