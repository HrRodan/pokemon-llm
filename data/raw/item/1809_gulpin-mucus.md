## Identity & Utility
**Gulpin Mucus** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material shed or secreted by the Gulpin evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create specific move-teaching items. It cannot be bought directly from standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a small amount of currency.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a fundamental ingredient in the crafting recipes for various TMs. In the Paldea region, it is required to manufacture poison-type and status-inflicting moves. Examples of TMs requiring this material typically include:
    * **TM091 (Toxic Spikes)**
    * **TM148 (Sludge Bomb)**
    * **TM175 (Toxic)**
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Utility/Preparation only).** While the item itself has no tactical value in a match, it is essential for "Teambuilding" to grant Pokémon access to high-tier competitive moves like *Sludge Bomb*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Gen IX crafting mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Gulpin family. It can also be traded at the TM Machine for **League Points (LP)**.
* **Wild Drop Source:** Dropped exclusively by wild **Gulpin** and **Swalot**. In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, these Pokémon are typically found in grassy or wetland biomes (such as South Province Area Three). Since it is a guaranteed drop upon victory, it is easily farmed for crafting large quantities of Poison-type TMs.
