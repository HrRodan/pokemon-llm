## Identity & Utility
**Naive Mint** is a **Nature-Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herb that, when consumed by a Pokémon, aligns its stat growth patterns with the **Naive** Nature. Specifically, it enhances **Speed** development while hindering **Special Defense** development. It is a **Consumable** item that is primarily used for post-game competitive optimization.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Internal value). While the JSON lists a low cost, in practice, these are high-value items typically purchased for **50 BP (Battle Points)** at Battle Towers or found as rare rewards, making them **Expensive/Special Acquisition** items.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the Pokémon's stat multipliers. It applies a **1.1x multiplier to Speed** and a **0.9x multiplier to Special Defense**. 
    * *Note:* Using this item does not change the Pokémon's actual Nature name (e.g., a "Modest" Pokémon will still be listed as "Modest" but will have "Naive" stats). This is crucial for mechanics like Berry flavor preferences or Toxtricity's evolution form, which remain tied to the original Nature.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility / Competitive Staple.** The Naive Mint is essential for **Mixed Attackers**—Pokémon that use both Physical and Special moves—who cannot afford to lower either offensive stat. By sacrificing Special Defense for Speed, the Pokémon remains a versatile threat in tiers like Smogon or VGC (e.g., for Pokémon like Dragapult or Greninja).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a quality-of-life item designed to make any Pokémon (such as a Shiny or a Legendary) competitively viable without the need for breeding for Natures.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily available in the **Battle Tower** (Sword/Shield, Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl) or the **Chanterelle** shop in the Indigo Disk (Scarlet/Violet). They can also be found as rare sparkling pickups on the floor in the Isle of Armor or Crown Tundra expansions.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. This is an artificial/processed medicine used by Trainers to "fix" a Pokémon's potential, rather than a naturally occurring resource gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
