## Identity & Utility
**Big Malasada** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A local culinary specialty of the Alola region consisting of fried bread. It functions as a versatile medical consumable that can be used once to heal a Pokémon of all major status conditions. It is a regional variant of the standard Full Heal.
* **Cost:** 350 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Cures a Pokémon of any major status ailment (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep) as well as the volatile status condition **Confusion**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Does not grant additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used during the **main story playthrough** or in **Nuzlocke challenges**. Like all medicine items, it is banned in standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon) but serves as a more thematic, flavor-rich alternative to the Full Heal or Heal Powder in the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is part of a tradition of "Regional Specialty" items (like the Lava Cookie, Old Gateau, or Casteliacone) that share the same effect as a Full Heal but carry unique cultural lore.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally exclusive to **Malasada Shops** throughout the Alola region. In later generations, it can often be found in specialty shops or received as gifts from NPCs.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is typically acquired via purchase or as a reward for local interactions in the Alola region. 
* **Lore Context:** In the Generation VII games, the Big Malasada is famously loved by the rival character Hau and the Pokémon Munchlax/Snorlax, emphasizing its role as a bridge between the region's culture and Pokémon care.
