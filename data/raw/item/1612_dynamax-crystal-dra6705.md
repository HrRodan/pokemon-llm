## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA6705)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it activates a specific Max Raid Battle. It functions as a "raid-on-demand" trigger that lasts until the end of the day it is activated.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a nominal value in the game data, it is not sold at standard Marts and is typically acquired through serial codes or pre-order bonuses.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon use at the Watchtower Lair, the crystal causes a specific Pokémon—specifically **Duraludon** (identified by the 'DRA' prefix)—to appear as a Dynamax boss. The raid persists until defeated or until midnight of the day it was activated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** This item has no direct impact on competitive battles. However, it is highly valuable for collectors and competitive players looking to farm a high-IV Duraludon, its Hidden Ability, or its Gigantamax form early in a playthrough, as these raid encounters often guarantee several perfect Individual Values (IVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid at the Watchtower Lair.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event Exclusive**. Historically, the DRA6705 crystal was distributed via serial codes as a pre-order bonus (notably through retailers like Amazon or the Pokémon Center) to provide players with an early-game Gigantamax-capable Duraludon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is strictly a reward/event distribution item. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which trigger random raids, Dynamax Crystals are "fixed" encounters, ensuring the player faces a specific species regardless of the standard den rotation.
