## Identity & Utility
**TM165 (Flare Blitz)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in the **Generation IX** DLC, *The Indigo Disk* (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item is a single-use instruction module (though repeatable via crafting in the TM Machine) used to teach a Pokémon the move **Flare Blitz**. As a "Machine" category item, it is essential for customizing the movepools of physical Fire-type attackers.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In its debut generation, it is acquired through exploration in the Terarium or crafted using 12,000 LP and specific Pokémon materials (Growlithe Fur, Ponyta Hair, and Charcadet Soot).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Flare Blitz** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Flare Blitz Details:** A high-risk, high-reward Physical Fire-type move with 120 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It deals 33% recoil damage to the user and has a 10% chance to burn the target. It also thaws the user if they are frozen.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal impact; TMs are generally consumed upon use and not meant for Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Elite.** Flare Blitz is the gold standard for physical Fire-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). It is a staple on competitive powerhouses such as **Arcanine-Hisui**, **Incineroar**, and **Cinderace**. Its inclusion as a TM allows a wider variety of physical attackers to gain necessary Fire-type coverage.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching utility.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found in the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy. Once found, it can be replicated infinitely at any TM Machine provided the player has the required League Points and materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. However, the materials required to craft it are gathered from wild **Growlithe**, **Ponyta**, and **Charcadet**.
* **Context:** Prior to TM165, Flare Blitz was often restricted to level-up learnsets or Egg Moves. Its availability as a TM in the Gen IX DLC significantly lowered the barrier to entry for optimizing physical attackers in the VGC and Smogon formats.
