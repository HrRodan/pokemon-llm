## Identity & Utility
**Hasty Mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized medicinal herb that, when used on a Pokémon, realigns its stat growth to match the **Hasty** nature. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that can be bought using specialized currency.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars/BP (**Cheap/Accessible**, though typically requires Battle Points or League Points rather than standard currency in its debut).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the Pokémon’s stat growth patterns. It increases the growth rate of the **Speed** stat (+10%) while decreasing the growth rate of the **Defense** stat (-10%). 
    * *Note:* Using this item changes the Pokémon's stat modifiers (indicated by red and blue highlights on the summary screen) but does **not** change the actual Name of the Nature (which remains relevant for flavor and certain mechanics like Berry preferences/Confusion).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** This item is essential for high-level VGC and Smogon play, as it allows trainers to optimize the stats of Legendary, Shiny, or Gift Pokémon that cannot be easily bred for the correct nature.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It serves as a "Quality of Life" mechanic to bypass traditional breeding constraints.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained at the **Battle Tower** (Sword/Shield) or **Chansey Supply** shops (Scarlet/Violet). It can also be found as a rare high-tier sparkle encounter in the Wild Area or Area Zero.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard held items, Mints are synthetic or rare cultivated medicines and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
