## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AUR2088** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** It is a consumable event item designed for use at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It functions as a "Raid Key" for a guaranteed encounter.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal). While the data lists a price, this item is functionally **not for sale** in standard Marts; it is typically acquired through serial code distributions (such as those bundled with the Sword & Shield Dual Pack).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), this crystal activates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—specifically **Larvitar** (in the case of the AUR2088 variant). This allows players to catch Pokémon that might otherwise be exclusive to a different version of the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an out-of-battle utility item used to facilitate encounters. However, the Pokémon caught from these raids often possess high Individual Values (IVs) and potentially Hidden Abilities, making it a valuable tool for breeding competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid den. It cannot be used if a raid is already active at the Watchtower Lair.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Code** as a promotional bonus. AUR2088 was famously included with the *Pokémon Sword and Shield Dual Pack* to allow players to encounter Larvitar (usually a Shield exclusive) early in either version.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a strictly event-managed item that cannot be farmed through the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters. Its presence in the game's economy is tied to external distributions rather than internal Galar region commerce.
