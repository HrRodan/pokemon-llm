## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CEP8417** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used in the Galar region. It is designed to be taken to the Watchtower Lair—a specific stone structure in the Wild Area's Watchtower Ruins. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically listed as cheap, but effectively a **Special Acquisition** item distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that remains active until the end of the day (midnight). In the case of code **CEP8417**, it facilitates an encounter with a **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** While the item itself has no function in a competitive match, it is a guaranteed method to encounter a Pokémon with high Individual Values (IVs) and the Gigantamax Factor, which is essential for building VGC or Smogon-tier teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon but is a "Raid Trigger." It allows players to bypass the standard Wishing Piece/Den RNG to hunt for a specific species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily distributed as a **pre-order bonus** or via retail distributions (such as Corocoro or specialized store events). It is not found in Marts or via standard gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Wonder Card" style distribution item, intended to drive community engagement and promotional sales for the Sword & Shield expansion era.
* **Location Context:** Its utility is strictly localized to the **Watchtower Ruins** in the Galar Wild Area; it cannot be activated in other raid dens or in the Crown Tundra/Isle of Armor maps.
