## Identity & Utility
**Bulbasaur Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy treat designed for the Bulbasaur evolutionary line. When consumed, it provides a comprehensive boost to the recipient's potential. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that functions as a stat-enhancer rather than a level-up item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it has a nominal value, it is primarily an earned resource rather than a store-bought commodity.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When given to a Pokémon in the Bulbasaur family (**Bulbasaur, Ivysaur, or Venusaur**), it increases **all six permanent stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 Awakening Value (AV)** point simultaneously. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **Core Mechanic in the "Let's Go" series**. It is used to maximize a Pokémon's "Awakening Values," which function similarly to EVs but allow for a much higher ceiling (+200 to every stat). It has no utility in standard mainline VGC or Smogon formats (Generations VIII and IX), as the AV system was replaced by the traditional EV/IV system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted exclusively to the Bulbasaur evolutionary line. It does not trigger evolution but significantly enhances the combat viability of the species at any stage of its growth.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Kanto region (Let's Go), these are primarily acquired by **transferring Bulbasaur to Professor Oak**, catching wild Bulbasaur in "catch combos," or through rewards in the GO Park.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically gathered as a reward for **Species-Specific Research** or mass-capturing. Unlike traditional medicines, it represents the specialized bond and training efficiency related to a specific evolutionary branch.
