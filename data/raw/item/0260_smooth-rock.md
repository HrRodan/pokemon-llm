## Identity & Utility
**Smooth-rock** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A smooth, specialized stone intended to be held by a Pokémon to enhance weather-altering capabilities. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that serves as a cornerstone for weather-based strategies. While it has a defined price, it is often found through exploration or specialized vendors rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate; reflects its status as a specialized tactical tool).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that uses the move **Sandstorm** or possesses the Ability **Sand Stream**, the duration of the resulting weather is extended from **five turns to eight turns**. 
* **Mechanical Nuance:** Because this item modifies the move/activation itself at the time of use, the extended duration persists even if the holder is switched out, faints, or has its item removed (e.g., via Knock Off) after the sandstorm has begun.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely low; provides no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Meta-Defining Staple.** It is mandatory for "Sand Teams" in both Smogon and VGC formats. By extending the window of Sandstorm, it maximizes the utility of Abilities like **Sand Rush** (speed boosting for sweepers like Excadrill) and **Sand Force**, while providing Rock-types a 1.5x Special Defense boost for a longer duration.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It belongs to the cycle of weather-extending rocks (alongside Heat Rock, Damp Rock, and Icy Rock).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Originally discovered in the **Sinnoh Underground**, highlighting its "Underground" attribute. In subsequent regions, it is typically found in desert environments (like Route 4 in Unova or the Haina Desert in Alola) or purchased via BP (Battle Points) in endgame facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not typically held by wild Pokémon**. It is primarily acquired as a fixed item find or through environmental scavenging mechanics (such as the Mining Minigame in Sinnoh or the Wild Area in Galar).
