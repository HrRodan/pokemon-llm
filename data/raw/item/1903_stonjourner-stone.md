## Identity & Utility
**Stonjourner Stone** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting ingredient dropped by wild Stonjourner. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for an effect.
* **Cost:** 120 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). In the context of Generation IX, this value often represents its exchange rate for League Points (LP) at the TM Machine.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a prerequisite ingredient at the **Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine)** to craft specific TMs. These materials are consumed along with League Points to create reusable move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its value is strictly tied to the "out-of-battle" economy, allowing players to expand their Pokémon's move pools by crafting TMs like **TM150 (Stone Edge)** or **TM101 (Power Gem)**.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX crafting loop where defeating or catching specific evolutionary lines provides the necessary components for move customization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching a wild **Stonjourner**. It is typically found in desert biomes (such as the Asado Desert in Paldea).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "Held Item" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Stonjourner**. Because Stonjourner is a **Version Exclusive** (Pokémon Scarlet), this material is often a bottleneck for Pokémon Violet players, who must obtain it through trade or by participating in Tera Raid Battles featuring Stonjourner.
