## Identity & Utility
**Ride-Pager** is a **Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech communication device used to summon specialized "Ride Pokémon" to assist the player in navigating the environment. It serves as the mechanical replacement for **Hidden Machines (HMs)**, allowing players to traverse water, fly to previously visited locations, or clear obstacles without requiring specific moves to be taught to their party members. While it exists in the game data as an item, it is functionally accessed via a dedicated menu or shortcut (the Y-button).
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Key Item; Not for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player the ability to call upon the **Poké Ride** service. Depending on the registered "numbers" (unlocked through story progression), it summons various Pokémon:
    * **Tauros Charge:** Breaks boulders.
    * **Stoutland Search:** Functions as an Itemfinder/Dowsing Machine.
    * **Charizard Glide:** Functions as the move Fly.
    * **Lapras Paddle/Sharpedo Jet:** Functions as the move Surf.
    * **Mudsdale Gallop:** Traverses rocky terrain.
    * **Machamp Shove:** Functions as the move Strength.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or flung in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility-based progression item for the overworld and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts with the world's navigation triggers (e.g., small boulders, water currents) that previously required specific HM moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Gifted to the player by **Kahuna Hala** in Iki Town after completing the first Grand Trial of the Island Challenge. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. This is a unique, one-of-a-kind device provided to participants of the Alolan Island Challenge.
* **Context:** The Ride-Pager represents a significant shift in Pokémon game design, prioritizing "Quality of Life" by decoupling environmental progression from a Pokémon's move set. It highlights Alola's cultural lore of human-Pokémon cooperation through the Poké Ride service.
