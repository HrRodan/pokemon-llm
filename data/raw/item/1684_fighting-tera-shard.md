## Identity & Utility
**Fighting Tera Shard** is a **Tera Shard** introduced in **Generation 9 (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A peculiar, crystalline shard that glows with Fighting-type energy. It functions as a specialized currency or crafting material used to alter the fundamental Terastal energy of a Pokémon. It is a **Consumable Resource** that cannot typically be purchased in standard Poké Marts, though it has a nominal sell value.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard sell value; primarily acquired through gameplay rather than purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When 50 Fighting Tera Shards are collected, they can be traded to the chef at the **Treasure Eatery in Medali**. This process changes a Pokémon's **Tera Type** to Fighting. This is a permanent change unless overwritten by another 50 shards of a different type.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Meta Significance.** Changing a Pokémon's Tera Type to Fighting is a core strategic element in VGC and Smogon formats. It is often used defensively to resist Dark, Rock, and Bug-type moves, or offensively to grant a Pokémon STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) on powerful Fighting moves like Close Combat or Focus Blast.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Terastal Phenomenon** mechanic. It cannot be used by Pokémon with the ability **Klutz** in any meaningful way during battle, as it is a pocket item, not a held item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained as rewards for completing **Tera Raid Battles** (specifically against Fighting-type Raid Bosses). They can also be found as sparkling dropped items in the overworld across the **Paldea** region, **Area Zero**, and the **Land of Kitakami**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Shards are gathered through environmental exploration and defeating Tera-crystallized wild encounters. Significant quantities are often rewarded during limited-time **7-Star Tera Raid events**.
