## Identity & Utility
**Bruxish Tooth** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Gnash Teeth Pokémon, Bruxish. It is categorized as a crafting component used at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. As a material, it is a consumable resource specifically for move-teaching utility.
* **Cost:** 100 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, its primary value lies in its conversion into League Points (LP) or its use as a reagent in crafting.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a mandatory ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. Specifically, it is used to craft moves associated with Bruxish's typing or physical characteristics, such as **TM063 (Psychic Fangs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** No direct tactical application in battle. Its utility is purely preparation-based, allowing trainers to customize the move-sets of their competitive roster by crafting high-value physical or psychic-type attacks.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a crafting resource and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward after defeating or catching wild **Bruxish**. In the Paldea region, these are typically found in the coastal waters of the East and South Paldean Seas.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a traditional "held item" that can be stolen with Thief or Covet, it is a guaranteed drop (1-3 units usually) upon the conclusion of an encounter with its namesake Pokémon. It is a vital resource for players looking to optimize Physical Psychic-type attackers.
