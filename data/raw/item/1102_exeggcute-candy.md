## Identity & Utility
**Exeggcute Candy** is a **Species-specific Stat Booster** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized candy packed with energy. Unlike standard stat-specific candies (like Health or Mighty Candies), this item is tailored to the unique biological makeup of the Exeggcute evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item that can be sold but is not typically purchased through standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by an **Exeggcute** or **Exeggutor** (including its Alolan Form), it increases **all six of the Pokémon's stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point simultaneously in the form of Awakening Values (AVs).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling move and held item mechanics are absent in the titles where this item exists).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is vital for "Unrestricted" competitive formats within the *Let's Go* meta, where Awakening Values are permitted. It allows a Pokémon to reach its maximum mathematical potential (up to +200 in every stat). It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats for Gen 8 or 9.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** There is no level requirement for using species-specific candies. It is the most efficient way to power up an Exeggcute or Exeggutor compared to using individual stat candies, which have tiered size requirements (Regular, L, and XL) based on the Pokémon's level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!* through the following methods:
    * **Catching:** Catching many Exeggcute in a row (Catch Combos) frequently rewards Species Candy.
    * **Transferring:** Sending caught Exeggcute to **Professor Oak** will reward the player with these candies.
    * **Walking:** Using the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory to take an Exeggcute for a "stroll" in the real world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense; rather, it is "dropped" as a reward for successful captures. It is a core mechanic for players looking to optimize their team for the "Master Trainer" post-game battles.
