## Identity & Utility
**Pasta** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** These flour noodles are specialized cooking components used at a Pokémon Camp. It is a **Consumable** ingredient that can be purchased in-game for the specific purpose of completing the Curry Dex.
* **Cost:** 150 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively in the cooking mini-game at Pokémon Camp. When combined with various Berries, it creates different tiers of **Pasta Curry**. Consuming the resulting curry restores Pokémon HP, PP, and increases Friendliness (Happiness) and Experience Points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; provides no secondary status effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a cooking ingredient, it provides no tactical advantage in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. It is a "flavor" item used for party maintenance and Pokédex completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** No direct evolution utility. It interacts with the **Curry Dex** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Ingredients Sellers** located throughout the Galar Wild Area and in various city markets. It is part of a rotating inventory of culinary items.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike traditional battle items, this is a commercial commodity in the Galar region and is generally obtained through purchase rather than the **Pickup** ability or wild encounters.
