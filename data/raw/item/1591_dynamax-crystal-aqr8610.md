## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal AQR8610** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** (Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A single-use consumable used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. It is an event-exclusive item that serves as a beacon to summon a predetermined Dynamax Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, though practically invaluable as it is typically obtained through external promotional codes rather than in-game shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Ruins of Watchtower in the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon to appear in a Max Raid Battle. This encounter remains active until the end of the day the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item designed for Raids. Its primary value is providing access to specific Pokémon, potentially with Hidden Abilities or high IVs, which can then be trained for competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It specifically interacts with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar Wild Area. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which trigger random raids, Dynamax Crystals are hard-coded to specific encounters.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed via **Serial Codes** or special promotions (such as retail distributions or pre-order bonuses for the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield* Expansion Pass). This specific alphanumeric ID (AQR8610) identifies the unique promotional encounter assigned to the crystal.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item that cannot be farmed via the Pickup ability or Thief.
* **Context:** In the lore of the Galar region, these crystals contain high concentrations of Galar Particles, allowing a trainer to force a Dynamax phenomenon to occur at a dormant Power Spot.
