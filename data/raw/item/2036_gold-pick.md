## Identity & Utility
**Gold Pick** is a **Picnic** item introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A decorative pick used in the sandwich-making process during a Picnic. It serves as the final component to secure the sandwich's ingredients. It is a **Consumable** item that is consumed upon the completion of a sandwich.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When crafting a sandwich at a Picnic, the Gold Pick is used to pin the bread and fillings together. While the pick choice is largely cosmetic and does not alter the numerical values of the "Meal Powers" (such as Sparkling Power or Encounter Power), it is a required item to finish the minigame.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as it is strictly a mechanical component for the overworld Picnic system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. Its primary interaction is with the **Sandwich-making mechanic**, contributing to the duration and strength of Meal Powers that affect egg discovery, shiny rates, and experience gains.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at specialized grocery and supply stores throughout the Paldea region, most notably at **Sure Cans**, **Daily Ice**, and **Aguirre's Delicatessen**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is a mass-produced culinary tool designed for trainers. Unlike rare ingredients, the Gold Pick is readily available for purchase once the trainer has access to major hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, or Levincia.
