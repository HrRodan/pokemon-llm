## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CAS168)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-exclusive consumable used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. This specific crystal variant (CAS168) is a promotional item tied to serial code distributions. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Placeholder value; technically **Not for sale** in standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone structure in the East Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon to appear in a Max Raid Battle. The encounter persists until the end of the calendar day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in a standard battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is entirely focused on the "catch phase" of the game, allowing players to access rare encounters, Gigantamax forms, or Pokémon with Hidden Abilities that may otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon the successful activation of the raid den.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through normal exploration. It was distributed via **special promotions, pre-order bonuses, or retail serial codes** (such as those from GameStop, Best Buy, or CoroCoro). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard Raid Dens which require Wishing Pieces, Dynamax Crystals guarantee a specific, often high-rarity encounter designated by the "CAS" (Campaign) number.
* **Location:** Must be taken to the **Watchtower Lair** in the Wild Area to be activated. Once the crystal is used, a large pillar of red light appears, signaling the start of the special Max Raid Battle.
