## Identity & Utility
**Butter** is a sandwich-ingredient introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A smooth, creamy condiment used as a secondary ingredient in the Picnic sandwich-making mechanic. It is a consumable seasoning that is easily purchased from specialized food vendors in the Paldea region.
* **Cost:** 250 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a condiment during the sandwich-making mini-game. It contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**, which provide temporary overworld bonuses. Butter is specifically noted for its contribution to **Egg Power**, **Catching Power**, and **Item Drop Power** in various recipes.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. It has no utility in direct VGC or Smogon combat. Its value lies entirely in "Prep-Work"—specifically using **Egg Power** to accelerate the breeding of competitive-grade Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution or interact with battle-related abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Butter is a common commercial item. It can be purchased at **Deli Cioso** locations and the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia. It is typically available as soon as the player begins their Treasure Hunt.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is strictly a human-made culinary ingredient sourced through retail shops.
