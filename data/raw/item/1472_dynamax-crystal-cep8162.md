## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CEP8162** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A promotional consumable item used specifically in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon that persists until midnight of the day it was activated. It is an **Event-Exclusive Consumable** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Special Acquisition**). While it has a defined internal price, it is not sold in shops and was distributed via serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activation at the Watchtower Ruins (Watchtower Lair) causes a specific Raid Pokémon to appear. In the case of **CEP8162**, this crystal was historically used to encounter **Larvitar** (typically a *Shield* exclusive) or **Jangmo-o** (typically a *Sword* exclusive) depending on the version and specific code distribution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate rare encounters or capture Pokémon with Hidden Abilities/High IVs early in a playthrough.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not evolve Pokémon directly, but it provides access to pseudo-legendary evolution lines (Larvitar/Jangmo-o) that are otherwise restricted by version or progression.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was a **Pre-order Bonus** for players who purchased the *Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack*. It was delivered as a digital serial code. It is currently unavailable through legitimate modern means as the distribution codes have expired.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is categorized as a "Special Item" intended for the Galar region's Max Raid mechanic. 
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles that can "force" a Power Spot to activate, even if it is not currently glowing with a natural raid beam.
