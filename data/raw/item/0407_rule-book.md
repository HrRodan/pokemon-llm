## Identity & Utility
**Rule-book** is an **Unused / Key Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** It is intended to list the specific rules for various battle formats. According to its flavor text, it was designed to allow players to choose and review rule sets for linked battles. However, in the final release of the games, it is categorized as an "unused" item.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale / Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In theory, the item provides a list of battle types and their corresponding regulations (such as level caps, item bans, or species restrictions). In practice, it has no effect on gameplay as it cannot be legally obtained.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items and Unused items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. The item serves no functional purpose in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon; the "rules" it would describe are now handled by built-in game menus or tournament software.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not interact with any Pokémon evolution lines, nor is it affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** While the item exists within the internal data of *Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum*, it was never distributed through events or placed in a specific location for players to find. It remains a "dummy" item within the game code.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon.
* **Lore Context:** The Rule-book represents a period in the franchise (the transition to the Nintendo DS) where developers were formalizing wireless link battle rules. It was likely intended to be a digital manual provided to players to explain the new global and local communication features before these tutorials were integrated directly into the Battle Frontier and Union Room interfaces.
