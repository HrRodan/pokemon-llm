## Identity & Utility
**TM126 (Dragon Cheer)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
*   **Description:** This machine is a single-use (in Gen IX) or repeatable-crafting instruction used to teach a Pokémon the move **Dragon Cheer**. It is categorized as a specialized support tool for double battles.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not available for direct purchase; must be crafted or obtained via story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Cheer**. When used in battle (primarily Double Battles), the user lets out a cry that raises the critical-hit ratio of its allies. If the ally receiving the effect is a **Dragon-type**, its critical-hit ratio is increased by **two stages**; otherwise, it is increased by one stage.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be Flung in Gen IX or have no specific combat effect).
    *   **Competitive Use:** This is a **VGC/Doubles-focused niche item**. It is highly effective when paired with Dragon-type sweepers or Pokémon with the *Sniper* ability (like Kingdra or Intelion) to guarantee critical hits, bypassing an opponent's defensive stat boosts.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its effectiveness is strictly tied to the **Dragon-type** classification of the target ally.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Specifically tied to the **Blueberry Academy** in the Unova region (Indigo Disk DLC). It is obtained as a reward for defeating the Elite Four member **Drayton**. 
*   **Crafting Requirements:** Once obtained, it can be replicated at a TM Machine using:
    *   1,500 League Points (LP)
    *   2x Tatsugiri Scales
    *   2x Lapras Teardrops
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made technical disc specific to the Blueberry Academy curriculum.
