## Identity & Utility
**Nymble Claw** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A raw material dropped by the Nymble evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Component** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. Within the Paldean economy, it serves as a specialized currency for the creation of Technical Machines.
* **Cost:** 60 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Nymble Claw is used as a specific ingredient at the **TM Machine** (located at any Pokémon Center) to craft TMs. It is consumed along with League Points (LP) to produce permanent move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, as it is strictly an out-of-battle resource for move-set customization.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Pokémon Materials" inventory system used to manage the crafting economy in *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a guaranteed drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Nymble family. It is not sold in standard Poké Marts but can be exchanged for small amounts of League Points (LP) at the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is dropped by wild **Nymble** and **Lokix**. Players often farm these in the early-game areas of the Paldea region (such as South Province Area One) to stock up on materials for Bug-type TMs.
