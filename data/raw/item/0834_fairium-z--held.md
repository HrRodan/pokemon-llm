## Identity & Utility
**Fairium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item is a crystallized manifestation of Z-Power specifically attuned to Fairy-type energy. When held by a Pokémon that knows at least one Fairy-type move, it enables the use of powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Special Held Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or consumed.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; acquired through story progression).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held, the Pokémon can upgrade its Fairy-type moves. 
    * **Attacking Moves:** Converts Fairy-type damaging moves into the Z-Move **Twinkle Tackle**. The power of the resulting Z-Move scales based on the base move's power.
    * **Status Moves:** Enhances Fairy-type status moves with additional "Z-Effects" (e.g., Z-Belly Drum or Z-Geomancy), often boosting the user's stats or restoring HP in addition to the move's normal effect.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Generation VII Meta).** Fairium Z was a defining item in the Sun/Moon era. It allowed Fairy types like **Mimikyu**, **Tapu Lele**, and **Magearna** to break through defensive walls using a one-time high-damage burst. 
    * **Immunity:** Z-Crystals are unique in that they **cannot be removed** by *Knock Off*, stolen via *Thief* or *Covet*, or swapped using *Trick* or *Switcheroo*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not required for any known Pokémon evolutions. It interacts strictly with the **Z-Ring** or **Z-Power Ring** held by the Trainer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it is obtained from the Trial Captain **Mina** in Vast Poni Canyon. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is rewarded after completing Mina’s trial.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard held items, Z-Crystals are treated as Key Items in terms of acquisition but must be equipped in the held item slot to function. They are generally gathered through the **Island Challenge** rite of passage.
