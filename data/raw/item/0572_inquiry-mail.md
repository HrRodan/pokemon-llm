## Identity & Utility
**Inquiry Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Stationery specifically designed to facilitate questions between Trainers. It is a **Consumable/Stationery** item that can be bought at most Poké Marts. Once a message is composed and given to a Pokémon, it serves as a communication tool during trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a predetermined list of words and phrases. The item is then held by a Pokémon to be delivered to another player via trading. Once the recipient reads the message, they can choose to erase it (making the stationery reusable) or store the message in their PC's Mailbox.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While primarily a social tool, Mail has a niche defensive utility: a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot have its item removed or stolen** by moves like *Thief*, *Covet*, *Knock Off*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo*. This makes it a permanent item slot that protects against item-manipulation strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **PC Restriction:** A Pokémon holding Inquiry Mail cannot be placed into a PC Box; the Mail must be removed first.
    * **Sticky Mechanics:** Unlike most items, Mail is "sticky" and remains with the Pokémon even during transformations or certain battle mechanics, serving as a hard counter to item-theft.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Poké Marts and specialized Stationery shops throughout the Unova region (Gen V) and Kalos region (Gen VI). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased by the Trainer to be utilized. 
* **Lore Context:** Inquiry Mail represents the era of Pokémon communication before integrated global chat systems, emphasizing the "Inquiry" theme through its specific background art (usually featuring a question mark or inquisitive aesthetic).
