## Identity & Utility
**Explorer Kit** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized bag containing tools (including a hammer and pickaxe) used to access the Sinnoh Underground. It is a **Key Item** that is used exclusively in the overworld to transition the player from the surface to the subterranean map. It **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Key Item/Special Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag while standing outside in the Sinnoh region, it transports the player to the **Underground** (or **Grand Underground** in Gen VIII). This area allows for base-building, fossil hunting, and multiplayer interactions.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no application in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be held by a Pokémon and provides no combat bonuses.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While the kit itself does not evolve Pokémon, it is the primary engine for obtaining **Evolution Stones** (Fire, Thunder, Water, etc.) and **Fossils** in the Sinnoh region through the digging minigame. It also facilitates the acquisition of **Shards** used for move tutoring and **Heart Scales** for move relearning.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically obtained in **Eterna City**. The player must speak with the **Underground Man** (located in the house next to the Pokémon Center), who provides the kit as a gift and offers a series of tutorials on its use.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is unique and is **never** held by wild Pokémon. It cannot be obtained through the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The kit represents a trainer's entry into the Sinnoh mining culture, allowing them to excavate ancient treasures and participate in the region's unique underground ecosystem. In the *Brilliant Diamond* and *Shining Pearl* remakes, this kit was updated to include access to Pokémon Hideouts, significantly expanding its utility for catching rare species.
