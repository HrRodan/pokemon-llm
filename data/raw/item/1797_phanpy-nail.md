## Identity & Utility
**Phanpy Nail** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by the Phanpy evolutionary line. It is categorized as a crafting resource used exclusively at the TM Machine in the Paldea region. As a raw material, it is a **Consumable** item that can be sold for a small amount of currency or converted into League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). At the TM Machine, players combine Phanpy Nails with League Points (LP) to create permanent move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "Materials" pocket of the bag).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the preparation phase of competitive play, allowing trainers to teach essential moves to their team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Generation IX crafting ecosystem and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a battle context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild **Phanpy** or **Donphan**. It is frequently found in the grassy and rocky biomes of the Paldea region where these Pokémon reside (such as West Province Area Two or South Province Area Four).
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop upon the conclusion of an encounter with the **Phanpy** line. It is a staple resource for players looking to teach heavy-hitting or elemental-fang moves to their Pokémon.
* **Crafting Applications:** Specifically used to craft moves such as:
    * **TM010 (Ice Fang)**
    * **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**
