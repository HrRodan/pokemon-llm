## Identity & Utility
**Amaze-Mulch** is a **Mulch** (agricultural consumable) introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized fertilizer designed to optimize Berry growth. It is a consumable item used on soft soil patches before or after planting a Berry. While highly effective in its debut region, flavor text indicates it is incompatible with the soil of the Hoenn region (Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire), making it a region-specific farming tool.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A multi-purpose fertilizer that combines the benefits of several other mulches. It increases the final Berry harvest by **2 units**, significantly boosts the chance of **Berry Mutations** (cross-breeding two different Berries), and causes the soil to dry out quickly (every **4 hours**), allowing for more frequent watering and faster growth cycles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats, as it cannot be used in battle and provides no benefit when held. Its value is strictly for the "Berry Master" or players engaged in resource farming and Nuzlocke preparation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is a key component for players looking to obtain rare Berries through the **Mutation mechanic** in the Kalos Berry Fields (e.g., obtaining Maranga or Kee Berries).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon X and Y*, it is primarily obtained at the **Berry Fields** on Route 7 by mixing different Berries in the composters. It can also be purchased from the **Medal Office** or the **Poké Mile Shop** on the Global Link (now legacy).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries which can be farmed via **Pickup** or found on wild creatures, Amaze-Mulch must be crafted or purchased by the player.
* **Regional Context:** Its inability to work in Hoenn is a mechanical distinction; Generation VI's Berry Mutation system was exclusive to the Kalos region, while Hoenn's Berry system in the remakes followed more traditional growth rules.
