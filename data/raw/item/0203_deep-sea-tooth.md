## Identity & Utility
**Deep-Sea Tooth** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn Region)**.
* **Description:** A sharp, silver-gleaming fang intended for Clamperl to hold. It is a **Held Evolution Item** that serves a dual purpose: it provides a massive stat boost to a specific Pokémon in combat and triggers a trade-based evolution. 
* **Cost:** 2,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Affordable**; though typically found rather than purchased in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** 
    * **Combat:** When held by **Clamperl**, it doubles the holder's Special Attack stat.
    * **Evolution:** If a Clamperl holding the Deep-Sea Tooth is traded, it evolves into **Huntail**. The item is consumed upon evolution.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage; an effective choice for the move Fling if the user needs a high-base-power Dark-type physical hit).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily used in **Little Cup (LC)**. Because it doubles Clamperl's Special Attack, it transforms Clamperl into one of the most powerful—albeit slow—special wallbreakers in the format. Outside of LC, it is considered niche as Clamperl's base stats (other than Special Attack with the boost) are too low for higher-tier play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is the specific branch-evolution trigger for **Huntail** (contrasting with the Deep-Sea Scale, which evolves Clamperl into Gorebyss).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically obtained from Captain Stern in Slateport City (Gen III/VI) in exchange for the Scanner. In later generations, it is often found in underwater areas using the Move/Field move **Dive**.
* **Wild Held Item:** It can be farmed from wild populations. It is occasionally held by wild **Carvanha**, **Sharpedo**, **Basculin (Red-Striped)**, and **Huntail**. Using a Pokémon with the **Frisk** ability to identify the item and **Covet** or **Thief** to steal it is the most efficient acquisition method.
