## Identity & Utility
**Dropped-item--yellow** is a **Key Item / Quest Item** categorized as "unused" in the provided data, though it originates in context from the Unova region (Generation V) and appears as a legacy entry in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** This item is an Xtransceiver (a communication device) discovered at the Nimbasa City amusement park. Based on the flavor text, it specifically belongs to a girl (Yancy). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In its original context (Pokémon Black 2 and White 2), picking up this item initiates a long-running sidequest. The player must carry the item to trigger calls from the original owner (Yancy). After several interactions and meetings, the player eventually returns the device, leading to the ability to trade for rare Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a story-progression item with no utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual battle formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, completing the quest associated with this item allows the player to trade for Pokémon with **Hidden Abilities**, which are otherwise difficult to obtain.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found on the ground at the **Nimbasa City Amusement Park** (near the Ferris Wheel). In the data provided for Generation VII, it exists as a non-functional or "unused" asset, likely maintained for internal indexing or legacy compatibility.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique, one-time world object. It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The "Yellow" variant of the Dropped Item is exclusive to players who chose the **Male protagonist**, as the item belongs to the female NPC **Yancy**. (The "Red" variant belongs to Curtis for female protagonists).
