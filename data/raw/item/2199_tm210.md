## Identity & Utility
**TM210 (Supercell Slam)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX** as part of the *The Indigo Disk* expansion for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
* **Description:** A machine used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumables that can be reproduced using a TM Machine with League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials. It is a **Consumable Teaching Item** that **cannot be bought** with standard Poké Dollars at traditional Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; requires crafting via 10,000 LP and specific Pokémon materials).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Supercell Slam** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Supercell Slam is a high-power Physical Electric-type move (Power: 100 / Accuracy: 95). 
    * **Risk Mechanic:** Similar to High Jump Kick, if the move misses or is neutralized (e.g., used against a Ground-type or a target using Protect), the user takes "crash damage" equal to 50% of its maximum HP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Modern TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** High-risk, high-reward Physical Electric coverage. It is frequently considered by physical attackers who lack strong Electric STAB options without recoil (like Wild Charge), such as **Pawmot**, **Electivire**, or **Iron Hands**. However, its usage is risky in VGC and Smogon formats due to the prevalence of Ground-type switch-ins and the *Protect* move, both of which trigger the self-damage penalty.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a key tool for expanding the movepools of physical attackers in the Generation IX meta.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found within the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy (*The Indigo Disk* DLC). It is typically located as a collectible item ball in the **Canyon Biome**. Once obtained, it can be crafted infinitely at any TM Machine.
* **Crafting Recipe:** 
    * 10,000 LP
    * Elekid Fur ×5
    * Shinx Claw ×3
    * Pincurchin Spines ×3
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Materials must be gathered by defeating or catching the **Elekid**, **Shinx**, and **Pincurchin** evolutionary lines.
