## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Dra6688** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. When used at the Watchtower Lair, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a single-use consumable that functions similarly to a "Key Item" for initiating localized events.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Placeholder value; typically distributed via external promotional codes rather than standard Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player stands before the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific stone structure in the West Lake Axewell region of the Galar Wild Area) and uses this item, a massive pillar of light is activated. This forces a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, typically a **Gigantamax Duraludon** (implied by the "dra" prefix in the internal ID).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This item has no impact on competitive PvP battles; its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of catching rare or powerful Pokémon for a player's roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, the Pokémon caught through this crystal's raid often possess the **Gigantamax Factor**, unique Hidden Abilities, or high individual values (IVs), making it highly valuable for competitive teambuilding.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available through regular gameplay or NPC shops. It was distributed as a **Special Event/Serial Code** item (often through retail partnerships or CoroCoro promotions). Once the code is redeemed and the item is used, the pillar of light remains active only until midnight of the day it was used.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to facilitate specific "Max Raid Battle" encounters that are otherwise rare or time-gated in the base game.
