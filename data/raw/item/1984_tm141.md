## Identity & Utility
**TM141 (Dragon Cheer)** is a **Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** A Technical Machine used to teach the move **Dragon Cheer** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, TMs are single-use consumables that can be replicated at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not available for traditional purchase; requires crafting or event acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dragon Cheer**. This is a Dragon-type Status move that motivates the user's allies. In Double Battles, it raises the critical-hit ratio of an ally. If the ally is a **Dragon-type**, its critical-hit ratio is boosted by **two stages**; otherwise, it is boosted by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be effectively used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Synergistic.** It is primarily designed for VGC (Double Battles). It pairs exceptionally well with "Sniper" ability users or Pokémon holding a Scope Lens to guarantee critical hits. It sees play in specific "crit-fish" strategies.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** **Mandatory Evolution Tool.** TM141 is the unique catalyst for evolution for the Applin line. **Dipplin** will only evolve into **Hydrapple** when it levels up while knowing the move taught by this TM (Dragon Cheer).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically found in the **Terarium** of Blueberry Academy (*The Indigo Disk* DLC). It is typically gifted to the player by the Elite Four member **Drayton** after he is defeated. 
* **Crafting Requirements:** Once obtained, it can be crafted at any TM Machine. Standard materials required typically include:
    * 1,500 LP
    * Tatsugiri Scales
    * Lapras Tears
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. As a TM, it is a manufactured technological item rather than a natural resource.
