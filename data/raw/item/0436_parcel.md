## Identity & Utility
**Parcel** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh Region)**.
* **Description:** A specific package entrusted to the player by the Rival's mother in Twinleaf Town. It is a **Key Item** intended for delivery to the player's childhood friend (the Rival). It cannot be sold, tossed, or given to a Pokémon to hold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a narrative trigger. Upon reaching **Jubilife City**, the player delivers this item to their Rival inside the Trainers' School. The parcel contains **two Town Maps**; as a reward for the delivery, the Rival provides one of the maps to the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and holds no utility in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) or battle facilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle-related abilities. It is strictly a "Plot-advancement" tool used to unlock the World Map interface for the player.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained automatically during the early-game sequence in **Twinleaf Town**. The Rival's mother asks the player to deliver it after the Rival forgets it in his haste to begin his journey.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time-use story item.
* **Lore Context:** The Parcel highlights the frantic and forgetful nature of the Sinnoh Rival (Barry), establishing his character archetype and providing the player with their first primary objective after leaving the starting town. Once delivered, it is removed from the player's "Key Items" pocket.
