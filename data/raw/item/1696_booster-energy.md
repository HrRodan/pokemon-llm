## Identity & Utility
**Booster Energy** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized high-tech capsule containing concentrated energy. It is a **consumable, single-use held item** that cannot be purchased in standard Poké Marts. It is designed specifically to interface with the unique biologies of Paradox Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; not available for sale).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon with the Ability **Protosynthesis** (Past Paradox Pokémon) or **Quark Drive** (Future Paradox Pokémon), the item is consumed upon entering battle to automatically activate the Ability. This boosts the Pokémon's most proficient stat (excluding HP) by 30%, or by 50% if the highest stat is Speed.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (However, it is almost always consumed by the holder’s ability before Fling can be utilized).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** It is an essential item in VGC (Doubles) and Smogon (Singles) formats for Paradox Pokémon such as **Flutter Mane, Roaring Moon, Iron Valiant,** and **Iron Hands**. It allows these Pokémon to reach peak power or speed immediately without requiring Sunny Day or Electric Terrain support.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the signature abilities of Paradox Pokémon. Because it is consumed immediately, the holder becomes vulnerable to effects like *Poltergeist* (which will fail) or can benefit from the *Unburden* ability (if applicable via Mimic/Transform) or *Acrobatics* (doubling power after consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found within **Area Zero (The Great Crater of Paldea)**. It is often located near the Research Stations or deep within the crystal caverns. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Occasionally found on wild Paradox Pokémon encountered in Area Zero. In the game's narrative, it represents the artificial or ancient energy source used to sustain these "displaced" Pokémon outside of their natural environments or time periods. Management of this item is critical in Nuzlocke runs, as it is a finite resource until the post-game.
