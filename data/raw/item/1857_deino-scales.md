## Identity & Utility
**Deino Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by the Deino evolutionary line. As a part of the TM Machine ecosystem, it is categorized as a consumable resource used for move acquisition rather than direct battle utility. It is a **Consumable Crafting Item** that can be sold for a modest amount of currency.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars/League Points (Cheap/Standard material value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used exclusively as an ingredient at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) in the Paldea region. Players combine these scales with League Points (LP) and other materials to craft specific TMs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** While the item itself has no competitive presence, it is a vital "gatekeeper" resource for competitive team building. It is required to teach powerful moves (typically Dragon-type or Dark-type moves associated with the Hydreigon line) to other Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a currency/material for move-learning mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching members of the Deino family in the wild or through Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a traditional held item. Instead, it is automatically rewarded after encounters with wild **Deino**, **Zweilous**, or **Hydreigon**. In *Pokémon Scarlet*, these are found in caves and mountainous regions; in *Pokémon Violet*, they are typically acquired via trading or Raids due to version exclusivity.
* **Lore Context:** Deino Scales represent the rough, unrefined nature of the "Irate Pokémon." These materials allow the TM Machine to replicate the specific energy or techniques used by the Hydreigon line.
