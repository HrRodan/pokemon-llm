## Identity & Utility
**Nidoran♂ Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable energy snack designed for the Nidoran♂ evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be bought in standard Poké Marts but can be sold for a nominal fee. It is used exclusively in the overworld to permanently enhance a Pokémon's potential.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Nidoran♂ family, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously via the **Awakening Value (AV)** system. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used in battles where Fling is an active mechanic).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is a **staple for "Let's Go" format competitive play**, as maximizing a Pokémon's AVs is required to reach peak performance. However, it has **no utility in traditional Smogon or VGC formats** (Generations VIII and IX), as the AV system was replaced by the return of the standard EV (Effort Value) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is restricted to the **Nidoran♂, Nidorino, and Nidoking** evolutionary line. It does not trigger evolution but is the most efficient way to maximize the stats of these specific Poison-types compared to generic candies (like Health Candy or Courage Candy).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained by catching wild Nidoran♂ in high volumes, sending Nidoran♂ to Professor Oak, or by walking with a Pokémon in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory. It is a reward for dedicated "chaining" (Catch Combos) of the species.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily gathered through **Catch Combos** or as a reward for transferring species to the Professor, reflecting the "grind" mechanic of the Kanto re-imagining.
