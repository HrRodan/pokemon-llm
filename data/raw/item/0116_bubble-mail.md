## Identity & Utility
**Bubble Mail** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring a decorative print of a blue underwater world. It is a **Consumable/Social** item designed for communication between players. It is holdable by Pokémon but functions differently than standard combat items, as it is primarily used to facilitate the delivery of handwritten messages during trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a short message from a pre-defined list of words and attach it to a Pokémon. When that Pokémon is traded, the recipient can read the message. Once read, the message can be erased to make the item reusable or stored in the Trainer's PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move **Fling**).
    * **Item Protection:** While a Pokémon is holding Mail, it **cannot be placed in the PC**. Furthermore, moves that manipulate items—such as **Knock Off**, **Thief**, **Covet**, **Trick**, or **Switcheroo**—will automatically fail against the holder. 
    * **Competitive Use:** In historical competitive formats (specifically Gen IV), Mail was occasionally used as a niche strategy to "sticky" a Pokémon's item slot, preventing the loss of an item to *Knock Off* or the unwanted receiving of a *Choice* item via *Trick*. Outside of this specific utility, it is considered a **flavor/story item** with no impact on stats or move power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the game's UI for message composition rather than battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** throughout the Sinnoh region and other compatible regions (Generations IV and V). It is typically found in the specialized "Mail" section of larger department stores.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not known to be held by wild Pokémon. It must be purchased by the Trainer to be used.
* **Lore context:** Bubble Mail is part of a series of regional stationery (like Bloom Mail or Flame Mail) used to personalize the social experience of trading Pokémon before the advent of more advanced global communication features in later generations.
