## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (ERI1464)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a special consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that lasts until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-type item** that technically has a cost associated with it, though it is not typically found in standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; likely a placeholder price for an item distributed via serial codes or promotional events).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (a specific Pokémon Den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon (referenced by the internal ID ERI1464) to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. This allows players to encounter Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** None (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. This is a utility item used exclusively in the overworld to facilitate Raids. It has no application in VGC or Smogon formats, though the Pokémon caught from the resulting raid may be competitively viable.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals are generally **Event-only items**. They were primarily distributed via serial codes through retailers (such as Target, GameStop, or Amazon) as pre-order bonuses or special promotions. They are not available through normal gameplay or Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild species; they are strictly digital distribution items designed to provide "instant" access to specific Dynamax encounters.
