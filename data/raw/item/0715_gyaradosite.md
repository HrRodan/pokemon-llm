## Identity & Utility
**Gyaradosite** is a **Mega Stone** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, mysterious stone designed to interact with a Trainer's Key Stone. When held by a Gyarados, it enables the Pokémon to undergo Mega Evolution during battle. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Not for sale** through standard vendors.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In most regions, it must be found through exploration or earned through high-level battle facilities rather than purchased.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by a Gyarados, the trainer can trigger a Mega Evolution. This transformation boosts the Pokémon's base stats (specifically Attack, Defense, and Special Defense) and changes its typing from **Water/Flying** to **Water/Dark**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 80 (Base damage). Note: Mega Stones generally cannot be removed or stolen from the holder if the Pokémon is capable of Mega Evolving with it.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple** (Generations VI–VII). Mega Gyarados is a premier physical sweeper. The transformation grants the **Mold Breaker** ability, allowing it to bypass defensive abilities like *Multiscale*, *Unaware*, or *Levitate*. The type change to Water/Dark provides a crucial immunity to Psychic and resistance to Dark/Ghost, though it introduces a weakness to Fairy, Bug, and Fighting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger a permanent evolution; it facilitates a temporary, mid-battle form change. It is unaffected by the ability *Klutz* regarding the transformation itself, but the item is essential for the "Mega" mechanic to function.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Kalos (X/Y):** Located in Couriway Town near the waterfalls (Post-game).
    * **Hoenn (ORAS):** Found in Sootopolis City near the Tree of Life.
    * **Alola (Sun/Moon):** Purchased at the Battle Tree for 64 BP.
