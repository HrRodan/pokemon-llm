## Identity & Utility
**Bagon Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A biological material dropped by members of the Bagon evolutionary line. It functions primarily as a crafting ingredient at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. It is a **consumable resource** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged for League Points (LP).
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard material value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required component for crafting specific **Technical Machines (TMs)**. Players must combine a specific quantity of Bagon Scales with League Points (LP) to create high-value moves, typically those associated with the Dragon type (such as **TM078 Dragon Claw** or **TM115 Dragon Pulse**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard TM materials generally lack specialized Fling effects and are not intended for held-item use).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in battle and cannot be held by a Pokémon to provide a statistical or tactical advantage. Its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it bears the name of the Bagon line, it is not an evolution item (like a Dragon Scale). It does not trigger evolution for Bagon or any other species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Bagon family. It is predominantly found in the **Paldea** region.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is automatically rewarded after encounters with wild **Bagon**, **Shelgon**, or **Salamence**. In *Pokémon Violet*, Bagon is a common sight in cave biomes, making these scales relatively easy to farm for players looking to teach powerful Dragon-type moves to their team.
