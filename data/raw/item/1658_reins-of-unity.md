## Identity & Utility
**Reins of Unity** is a **Plot-Advancement / Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar - *The Crown Tundra*).
* **Description:** Described as shining cords once presented to the King of Bountiful Harvests as a symbol of gratitude. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It is designed for infinite use once acquired to manage specific legendary transformations.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; cannot be purchased).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Reins of Unity act as a **fusion catalyst**. When used from the bag, they allow the player to fuse **Calyrex** with either **Glastrier** (to become Calyrex Ice Rider) or **Spectrier** (to become Calyrex Shadow Rider). Using the item again on a fused Calyrex will separate the two Pokémon back into their base forms.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself cannot be brought into battle, it is **mechanically essential** for competitive play (VGC/Ubers). It is the only way to access Calyrex-Ice and Calyrex-Shadow, both of which are dominant Restricted Legendaries known for their signature "As One" Ability and high base stat totals.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution but functions as a **form-change mechanism** similar to the DNA Splicers for Kyurem or the N-Solarizer/N-Lunarizer for Necrozma. It requires an empty slot in the party to separate the Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively during the *Crown Tundra* expansion storyline. The player must facilitate the crafting of the reins using a **Radiant Petal** (from Calyrex) and a **Mane Hair** (from either Glastrier or Spectrier) at the wooden statue in Freezington.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. This is a unique story-related item tied to the lore of the "King of Bountiful Harvests" and his bond with his loyal steed.
