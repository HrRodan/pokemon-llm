## Identity & Utility
**Drifloon Gas** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item represents a collection of trace gases or residue shed by the Drifloon evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or, more importantly, exchanged at the TM Machine. It **cannot be bought** from standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific crafting component used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. In Generation IX, it is a required ingredient for moves such as **TM052 (Snowscape)**, **TM054 (Pounce)**, and **TM092 (Imprison)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the "TM Materials" pocket).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the out-of-battle economy and move-pool customization. It has no effect on stats, healing, or Pokémon performance during a match.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the crafting loop introduced in the Paldea region, where materials are gathered from wild encounters to facilitate move teaching.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a drop from defeating or catching members of the Drifloon family in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense (like a Leftovers), it is automatically rewarded after encounters with wild **Drifloon** and **Drifblim**. Because Drifloon is a Ghost-type typically found at night, farming this material is time-dependent in the overworld. In Pokémon Scarlet, it is more readily available due to Drifloon's status as a version-specific encounter (though it can be found in Tera Raids in both versions).
