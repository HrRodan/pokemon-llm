## Identity & Utility
**Pidgey Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with energy. It is designed to be fed exclusively to members of the Pidgey evolutionary line (Pidgey, Pidgeotto, and Pidgeot). It is a **Consumable** item that is generally earned through gameplay mechanics rather than purchased in bulk at marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Cheap**; though its primary value is in its stat-boosting utility rather than its resale price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a Pidgey, Pidgeotto, or Pidgeot, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously by **1 Awakening Value (AV)**. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and has no Fling mechanics).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format-Specific.** This item is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon tiers. Its utility is restricted to the *Let's Go* series' "No Restrictions" competitive battles and "Master Trainer" challenges, where maximizing a Pokémon's 200-point AV cap per stat is required for optimal performance.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is a "Species Candy." It does not trigger evolution but is the most efficient way to maximize the potential of the Pidgey line, as generic candies (like Quick Candy) only raise a single stat and have level requirements, whereas Pidgey Candy has no level restriction and raises all stats.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in traditional Poké Marts. It is primarily acquired through the **Catch Combo** mechanic (catching multiple Pidgey in a row), transferring Pidgey-line Pokémon to **Professor Oak**, or by walking a Pidgey in the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found as a held item. It is a reward for the player’s proficiency in catching and managing wild Pokémon populations. In the context of the Kanto "Let's Go" ecosystem, it represents the specialized nutrition required to push a specific species to its physical peak.
