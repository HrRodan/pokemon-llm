## Identity & Utility
**Shaderoot Carrot** is a **Plot-advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (specifically in the *Crown Tundra* expansion of Pokémon Sword and Shield).
* **Description:** A specialized produce grown in a "gloomy field" that serves as the preferred food for the King of Bountiful Harvests’ ghost-type steed. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Shaderoot Carrot is used as a quest item to summon **Spectrier** at the Crown Shrine. Once obtained, it is placed in the "Small Basket" alongside the Radiant Petal to create the **Reins of Unity**, allowing Calyrex to fuse with Spectrier into **Calyrex (Shadow Rider)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself has no battle utility, it is the mandatory gatekeeper for obtaining **Spectrier** and **Calyrex-Shadow**, the latter of which is a defining "Restricted" legendary in VGC and Smogon Uber formats due to its incredible Speed and Special Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item represents a branching path in the story. Choosing to grow the Shaderoot Carrot (by planting Carrot Seeds in the **Old Cemetery**) permanently locks the player into obtaining the Ghost-type Spectrier instead of the Ice-type Glastrier.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained during the *Legendary Clue 1* questline in the Crown Tundra. Players must trade 8 pieces of **Dynite Ore** for Carrot Seeds and choose to plant them in the **Old Cemetery** (a "gloomy field") rather than the Snowslide Slope.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique quest-related object granted by the NPC Calyrex to test the player's bond with the land.
* **Lore context:** The Shaderoot Carrot draws its power from the spiritual energy of the cemetery, which is why it appeals specifically to the spectral nature of Spectrier. Its existence is tied to the restoration of Calyrex's full power.
