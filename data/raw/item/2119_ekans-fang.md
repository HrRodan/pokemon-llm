## Identity & Utility
**Ekans Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This item represents a biological sample (a shed fang) obtained from members of the Ekans evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon. While it has a technical buy/sell price, it is primarily used as a currency at the TM Machine.
* **Cost:** 15 Poké Dollars (Extremely Cheap/Nominal value; primarily sold for League Points (LP) or used in crafting).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the **out-of-battle crafting economy**, allowing players to teach moves to their competitive roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Technical Machine system introduced in the Paldea region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild **Ekans** or **Arbok**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; rather, it is automatically added to the player's "TM Materials" pocket upon successfully battling the corresponding Pokémon in the wild or through the "Let's Go!" auto-battle feature.
* **Context:** In the ecology of the Pokémon world, these materials represent the traces left behind by Pokémon (scales, claws, fangs), which the Pokémon League has standardized into a crafting system for move distribution.
