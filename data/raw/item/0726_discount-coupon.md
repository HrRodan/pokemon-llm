## Identity & Utility
**Discount-coupon** is a **Loot/Misc. Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** A special promotional voucher used specifically for purchasing high-end apparel. It is a **Consumable** item that is used during a transaction at a clothing boutique to drastically reduce the price of fashion items. While it technically has a registered cost, it is generally acquired through gameplay rewards rather than purchased.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, its value lies in the savings it provides on expensive luxury items).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When shopping at a boutique (specifically in the Kalos region), this coupon provides a **50% discount** on a single total purchase. The item is **consumed** immediately upon use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles (VGC/Smogon) as it pertains strictly to the trainer customization economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions and has no interaction with Pokémon abilities. It functions purely as a trainer-centric economic tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily found in **Pokémon X and Y**. It is famously obtained from an NPC in the **Lumiose City** juice bar or via the **PokéMileage Club** (Global Link) in older generations. It is designed to help players afford the "Expensive" clothing lines in Lumiose City, where single items can cost hundreds of thousands of Poké Dollars.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not held** by any wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gifted by NPCs or earned through out-of-game service rewards, making it a finite and valuable resource for players interested in character customization.
