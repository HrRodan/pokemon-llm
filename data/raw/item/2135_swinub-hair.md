## Identity & Utility
**Swinub Hair** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet)**.
* **Description:** This item is a biological sample dropped by members of the Swinub evolutionary line. It is categorized as a crafting ingredient specifically used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create various TMs. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount, though its primary value lies in TM production.
* **Cost:** 35 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Crafting Currency**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient in the creation of specific Technical Machines (TMs) in Paldea and Kitakami. When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, it is consumed to produce moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held by a Pokémon to provide a stat boost or effect. Its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle TM crafting system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution itself, it is fundamentally linked to the Swinub, Piloswine, and Mamoswine evolutionary family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Swinub family. It can also occasionally be found as a sparkling pickup on the ground in snowy biomes where these Pokémon reside.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a "held item" in the traditional sense, it is guaranteed to drop from:
    * **Swinub**
    * **Piloswine**
    * **Mamoswine**
* **Context:** In the ecological lore of the Paldea and Kitakami regions, these hairs are shed by the Pokémon as they burrow through ice and snow, making them easily collectable for trainers looking to synthesize powerful Ice or Ground-type moves.
