## Identity & Utility
**Petaya Berry** is an **In-a-pinch Consumable Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized Berry designed for held-item use in combat. It belongs to the elite "pinch" tier of Berries (alongside Salac, Liechi, and Ganlon) that trigger a stat boost when the user is critically weakened. It is a **Consumable/Holdable** item that is technically purchasable but rarely found in standard Marts.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible, though primarily acquired through cultivation rather than commerce).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP drops to **25% (1/4) or less** of its maximum, the Berry is consumed to raise the holder's **Special Attack by one stage (+1)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Consumption effect: If flung at an ally or opponent, the target receives the +1 Special Attack boost).
    * **Natural Gift:** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Poison-type** attack with **100 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** Historically used in "SubPetaya" sets, where a Special Sweeper uses **Substitute** three times to safely reach the 25% HP threshold, triggering a Sp. Atk boost to sweep. It is highly synergistic with the **Gluttony** ability (allowing consumption at 50% HP) and the **Unburden** ability (doubling Speed upon consumption).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its effectiveness is negated by the **Klutz** ability or the move **Embargo**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually acquired through the **Berry Master**, late-game Berry patches, or as a high-tier reward in Battle Facilities (e.g., Battle Frontier, Battle Maison). In its debut generation, it was famously rare, found primarily on the elusive **Mirage Island**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly found on wild Pokémon. It must typically be cultivated from a single seed or obtained via special NPCs. In certain generations, it may be gathered via the **Pickup** ability at very high levels (Level 91-100).
