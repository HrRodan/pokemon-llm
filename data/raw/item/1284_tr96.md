## Identity & Utility
**TR96 (Pollen Puff)** is a **Machine (Technical Record)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use Technical Record (TR) used to teach the move **Pollen Puff**. Unlike the TMs of the Galar region which are infinite-use, TRs are consumed upon use, mirroring the mechanics of classic TMs from earlier generations. It is a **Consumable** utility item.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). While it has a high monetary value, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) at Watt Traders in the Wild Area rather than purchased with standard currency at Poké Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Pollen Puff** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Logic:** Pollen Puff is a Bug-type Special move with 90 Base Power. It features a unique dual-utility mechanic: when targeted at an opponent, it deals damage; when targeted at an ally (in Double Battles), it restores up to 50% of that ally's maximum HP.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High). Using Fling with this item deals significant physical damage but consumes the TR.
    * **Competitive Use:** **VGC/Doubles Staple.** Pollen Puff is one of the most valuable support moves in competitive doubles formats. It allows offensive pressure against Dark, Psychic, and Grass types while providing reliable healing for a teammate. It is commonly taught to Pokémon like Amoonguss, Ribombee, and various "butterfly/moth" themed Pokémon to increase their utility.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a move-teaching tool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR96 is primarily acquired by defeating Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** (typically Bug-type dens) or by purchasing it from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (usually 3,000–8,000 Watts). It can also be generated via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is an artificial data storage device specifically manufactured for Pokémon training.
