## Identity & Utility
**Magikarp Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** (Medicine) introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).

*   **Description:** A specialized, energy-packed candy designated for the Magikarp evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be purchased from standard Poké Marts, but can be sold for a nominal fee. 
*   **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Nominal value; primarily used for farming/selling in bulk).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** When administered to a **Magikarp** or **Gyarados**, it increases all of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. This contributes to the **Awakening Value (AV)** system unique to the Let's Go series.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (This item exists only in games where the move Fling is not present).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** In the *Let's Go* competitive format, stat candies are essential for reaching the "AV cap." A Pokémon can receive up to 200 points in every stat via these candies, making them mandatory for optimizing a competitive Gyarados. It has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats that utilize the traditional EV/IV system.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is strictly limited to the **Magikarp** and **Gyarados** species. It cannot be used on any other Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** These candies are primarily earned through the **Catch Combo** mechanic (catching multiple Magikarp in a row). They are also rewarded for transferring Magikarp to **Professor Oak** or by walking with a Magikarp stored in the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon in the traditional sense. Instead, it is "harvested" from wild **Magikarp** through capture rewards and the Professor's research exchange, reflecting the game's emphasis on catching over battling for growth.
