## Identity & Utility
**TR80 (Electro Ball)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use move-teaching item that allows a compatible Pokémon to learn the move **Electro Ball**. Unlike the TMs of its generation, TR80 is consumed upon use. It represents a return to the classic "disposable" machine mechanic, balanced by its availability via specialized currencies.
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Mid-range/Standard for high-power technical records; frequently traded for Watts in its debut region).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Electro Ball**, a Special Electric-type attack. The move's power is dynamic: the higher the user's Speed is compared to the target's Speed, the greater the move's base power (ranging from 40 to a maximum of 150).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; provides no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** A niche but high-ceiling offensive option. It is most effective on Pokémon with top-tier Speed stats, such as **Regieleki**, or in strategies involving **Paralysis**, which effectively quarters the opponent's Speed and maximizes Electro Ball's damage output. It is generally preferred over Thunderbolt only if the user can consistently maintain a 4x Speed advantage over the meta-game's defensive cores.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. As a TR, it is subject to the **Cram-o-matic** recipes in the Isle of Armor DLC for recycling into other items.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Galar Wild Area** by exchanging Watts with **Watt Traders**. Its availability rotates daily. It is also a common reward for defeating Electric-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Its distribution is limited to Galar's unique "Technical Record" system, making it a regulated resource rather than a naturally occurring object.
