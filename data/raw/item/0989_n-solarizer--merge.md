## Identity & Utility
**N-Solarizer (Merge)** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in certain internal indices) introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A specialized scientific machine designed to fuse **Necrozma**, a Pokémon that thrives on light, with the Sunne Pokémon, **Solgaleo**. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon for trade.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique story item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, it initiates the fusion of a Necrozma and a Solgaleo in the player's party. This process transforms Necrozma into its **Dusk Mane** form. The Solgaleo is consumed by the fusion and is removed from the party until the "N-Lunarizer--Split" function is used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be thrown using Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself cannot be held in battle, it is the **mandatory gateway** for accessing **Dusk Mane Necrozma**. In competitive formats like **Ubers** and **Anything Goes (AG)**, Dusk Mane Necrozma is a top-tier threat, valued for its incredible physical bulk, the "Prism Armor" ability, and its role as a premier check to Xerneas and Zacian-Crowned.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Fusion Logic:** Only one Necrozma can be fused with Solgaleo (or Lunala) at a time per save file.
    * **Move Granting:** Upon fusion, Necrozma learns Solgaleo's signature move, **Sunsteel Strike**. It also allows Necrozma to use the Z-Move **Searing Sunraze Smash** if it holds Solganium Z.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Ultra Sun* and *Ultra Moon*, this item is acquired during the post-game narrative after the player captures Necrozma at Mount Lanakila. Colress provides the device to the player to facilitate the restoration/control of Necrozma's power.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique technological artifact tied to the Ultra Recon Squad and Aether Foundation's research into Ultra Space.
