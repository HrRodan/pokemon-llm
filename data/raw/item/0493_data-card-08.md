## Identity & Utility
**Data Card 08** is a **Data Card** (Key Item) introduced in **Generation IV** (specifically within the Johto-based *HeartGold and SoulSilver* titles).
* **Description:** A specialized record-keeping device used to track specific performance metrics within the Pokéathlon Dome. It functions as a permanent log for the player's achievements in a specific event. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought with standard currency.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired via Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Records and displays the cumulative number of times the Trainer has secured a first-place finish in the **Block Smash** Pokéathlon event. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None**. This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard battle formats; its value is strictly limited to the Pokéathlon mini-game completion and record tracking.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon or interact with battle-based abilities. It interacts solely with the Pokéathlon data interface located in the Pokéathlon Dome.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Purchased at the **Pokéathlon Dome's Athlete Shop** (found to the right of the registration desk) for **500 Athlete Points (AP)**. It is typically available for purchase on Mondays and Thursdays, though availability can vary by game progression.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon. This is a unique, man-made electronic card specifically designed for the Johto region's Pokéathlon competition.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of Data Cards (01 through 27), this specific card targets the **Power** and **Stamina** categories, as Block Smash is a primary event for Pokémon specializing in those stats. Collectibles of this type are essential for players aiming to achieve "Medalist" status for their Pokémon or to unlock the final rooms of the Pokéathlon Dome.
