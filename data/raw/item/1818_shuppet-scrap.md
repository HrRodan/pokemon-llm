## Identity & Utility
**Shuppet Scrap** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A specialized crafting material dropped by members of the Shuppet evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Component** that cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon. It is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TMM) found at Pokémon Centers.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible). While it can be sold for a small amount, its value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldean ecosystem, it is combined with League Points (LP) to create reusable move-teaching discs. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held; therefore, it cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Indirect).** The item itself has no presence in competitive VGC or Smogon formats. However, it is vital for the "prep-work" of competitive play, as it is required to craft essential Ghost-type or utility moves that Shuppet is known for (such as **TM092 Imprison** or **TM151 Phantom Force**).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the TM crafting mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the **Paldea** region and other Gen IX locales. It is obtained by defeating or catching wild Shuppet or Banette.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item. Instead, it is a **guaranteed drop** from:
    * **Shuppet**
    * **Banette**
* **Context:** This item represents the "spoils" of battle, reflecting a shift in Generation IX toward a resource-gathering loop where players must hunt specific species to build their move repertoires. Shuppet Scraps are often farmed in areas where Ghost-types congregate at night, such as the areas surrounding Artazon or the ruins within the South Province.
