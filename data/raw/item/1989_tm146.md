## Identity & Utility
**TM146 (Grass Pledge)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** (specifically within the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** This machine is used to teach a Pokémon the move **Grass Pledge**. In the context of the Paldea/Blueberry Academy ecosystem, it is a craftable, single-use item (consumable) that can be reproduced at any TM Machine using League Points and specific Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration or crafting rather than direct purchase from a Poke Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Grass Pledge** to compatible Pokémon. Grass Pledge is a Special Grass-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs generally cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** Primarily a **VGC/Doubles niche staple**. While its solo damage is outclassed by Energy Ball, it is used for **Pledge Combos**. When used in the same turn as *Water Pledge*, it creates a "Swamp" on the opponent's side, reducing their Speed by 75% for four turns. When combined with *Fire Pledge*, it creates a "Sea of Fire" that deals 1/8th of the opponent's max HP at the end of every turn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This move is historically restricted to **Starter Pokémon** from all generations. It represents the "bond" between the trainer and their starter.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically available in the **Terarium at Blueberry Academy** (*The Indigo Disk*). It can be found as a collectible item on the ground or unlocked for crafting at the TM Machine.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate TM146, the trainer typically requires:
    * **5,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Fomantis Leaf**
    * **3x Petilil Leaf**
* **Context:** Prior to Generation IX, the "Pledge" moves were taught by dedicated Move Tutors. TM146 marks the transition of this "tutor-only" move into a standardized, craftable machine format.
