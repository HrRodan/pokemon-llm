## Identity & Utility
**Magmar Candy** is a **Species Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable candy packed with concentrated energy. Unlike generic candies, this is tailored specifically to the Magmar evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable** item used to bypass traditional training by bolstering a Pokémon's raw potential.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**). While it has a sell price, these are primarily acquired through gameplay mechanics rather than being purchased at a standard Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a member of the Magmar family (Magmar), it increases **all stats simultaneously** (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. In the *Let's Go* engine, this contributes to **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item does not exist in generations where Fling is a usable mechanic with this item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Format Specific.** In the *Let's Go* competitive meta (where AVs are permitted), Species Candies are the most efficient way to "max out" a Pokémon, as they do not have the level requirements or stat-specific caps that smaller generic candies (like Courage Candy) possess. It is irrelevant in standard VGC or Smogon formats which use the Effort Value (EV) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is specifically restricted to the **Magmar** evolutionary line. While Magby and Magmortar exist in the wider franchise, in the games where this item is present, it applies solely to Magmar.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Gen VII) by:
    1. **Catch Combos:** Catching multiple Magmar in succession.
    2. **Professor Oak:** Transferring caught Magmar to the Professor.
    3. **Walking:** Using the Poké Ball Plus accessory to take a Magmar for a stroll in the real world.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is a reward for **Catch Mechanics** rather than a farmable loot item like a Magmarizer. It represents the "essence" or specialized nutrition for that specific species.
