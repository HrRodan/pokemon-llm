## Identity & Utility
**Red Bell Pepper** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A culinary ingredient used during the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It provides specific flavor profiles—primarily Sweet and Spicy—to the meal. It is a consumable item that can be purchased in bulk from specialized grocery vendors.
* **Cost:** 240 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in sandwich making, it contributes to the "Meal Power" of the resulting dish. Specifically, it provides a balance of **Sweet** and **Spicy** flavors. In the Paldean sandwich meta, Red Bell Pepper is a core component for recipes targeting **Fire-type** and **Bug-type** bonuses.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Sandwich ingredients are stored in a separate pocket and cannot be held by Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** None (Directly). However, it is vital for the "pre-game" competitive loop, as sandwiches containing this ingredient are used to increase **Egg Power** (for faster breeding) and **Encounter/Sparkling Power** (for hunting competitive-grade shiny Pokémon).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. Its primary interaction is with the **Picnic / Sandwich-making** mini-game and the **Meal Power** system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Sure Cans** and **Aquiesta Supermarket** locations throughout the Paldea region. It is available to the player early in the game.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is exclusively obtained through retail purchase or occasionally as a reward from **Tera Raid Battles**.
