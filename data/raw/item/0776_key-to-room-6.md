## Identity & Utility
**Key to Room 6** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (associated with the Hoenn region in ORAS).
* **Description:** A specific utility key designed to open a locked door within the Sea Mauville facility. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or traded. It is essential for navigating the non-linear exploration of the shipwreck.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Unlocks the door to **Room 6** in Sea Mauville. This allows the player to access the contents of that specific cabin, which typically contains items or leads to subsequent keys in the Sea Mauville quest chain.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no battle application and exists solely for overworld progression and completionism.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon. Its only interaction is with the environment (the locked door in Sea Mauville).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within the derelict facility of **Sea Mauville** (Hoenn). In the internal logic of the location, players usually find this key by searching sparkling spots or trash cans in previously unlocked rooms (such as Room 4), creating a "scavenger hunt" progression.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. As a unique Key Item, it cannot be held by wild Pokémon or gathered via the Pickup ability.
* **Context:** Sea Mauville is a decommissioned natural resources research platform. The keys represent the administrative history of the facility; obtaining the Key to Room 6 is a prerequisite for eventually obtaining the **Scanner**, which is vital for encountering legendary Pokémon (Ho-Oh in Omega Ruby or Lugia in Alpha Sapphire).
