## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Cen5460)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. It triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. This specific variant (Cen5460) is designated for encountering **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**). While it has a nominal price in the data, it cannot be purchased through standard in-game vendors.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (a specific den in the Wild Area), it causes a pillar of red light to appear, initiating a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon (in this case, Centiskorch). The encounter remains active until defeated or until the Nintendo Switch clock reaches midnight.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate rare captures and is not used in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the "Event Crystal" mechanic. Using it guarantees a Gigantamax-capable encounter, which is otherwise subject to low spawn rates or specific den rotations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed via **serial codes** through real-world retail partnerships (such as Target, GameStop, or Pokémon Center promotions). They are not available through natural gameplay or the Pokémon Center Mart.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. This is an event-exclusive item that serves as a physical "key" to unlock limited-time content.
* **World Knowledge:** The "Cen" in the internal name (Cen5460) refers to **Centiskorch**. These items allowed players to obtain Gigantamax forms earlier in their journey than normally possible through standard Max Raid den progression.
