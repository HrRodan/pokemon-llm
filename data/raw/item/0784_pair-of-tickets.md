## Identity & Utility
**Pair of Tickets** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VII** (though its narrative context is tied to the Hoenn region's Mossdeep Space Center).
*   **Description:** These are special admission tickets for two individuals to attend an astronomical show. As a Key Item, it cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon. It exists solely to facilitate a specific narrative event between the player and an NPC.
*   **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Grants the player and their mother access to a special "star show" held at the **Mossdeep Space Center**. In the context of the games, this item serves as a flag to trigger a specific post-game cutscene or dialogue sequence.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no mechanical impact on Pokémon stats, moves, or abilities. It is strictly a narrative tool used for world-building and character development.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve any Pokémon and has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** This is a **special event item**. In *Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire* (referenced by the Mossdeep location), it is traditionally given to the player by their father, Norman, at the Petalburg Gym after completing certain post-game requirements (the Delta Episode). 
*   **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind item that is deposited directly into the Key Items pocket of the bag.
*   **Lore Context:** The tickets represent a rare moment of family interaction in the Pokémon series, specifically intended for the player to spend time with their mother at the Space Center—a location central to the Hoenn region's lore regarding Deoxys and Rayquaza.
