## Identity & Utility
**TR67 (Earth Power)** is a **Technical Record (Move Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** TR67 is a single-use consumable item used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. Unlike the Technical Machines (TMs) of its debut generation, a Technical Record is consumed upon use and disappears from the bag. It teaches the move **Earth Power**, a high-tier Special Ground-type attack.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it can be sold for a high price, it is more commonly traded via non-standard currencies like Watts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Earth Power** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** Earth Power is a Special Ground-type move with 90 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. It has a 10% chance to lower the target's Special Defense by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90 (High damage output when used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Highly Essential.** Earth Power is the premier Special Ground-type coverage move in competitive formats (VGC and Smogon). It is a staple for powerful Special Attackers such as **Nidoking**, **Landorus-Therian**, **Heatran**, and **Gastrodon** because it offers perfect accuracy and hits common Steel, Rock, and Electric types for super-effective damage without the contact-risk or accuracy-checks of other moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a one-time teaching tool that is essential for optimizing the movesets of special-attacking Ground types or Pokémon requiring Ground-type coverage.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In Pokémon Sword and Shield, TR67 is primarily obtained through two methods:
    1. **Watt Traders:** Sold by various NPCs in the Wild Area for Watts (currency earned from Max Raid dens). The inventory of these traders rotates daily.
    2. **Max Raid Battles:** Dropped as a reward for defeating Ground-type Pokémon in Max Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered through the **Max Raid Battle** economy or by spending Watts, making it a resource-intensive item to "farm" compared to permanent TMs.
