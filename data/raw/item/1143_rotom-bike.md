## Identity & Utility
**Rotom Bike** is a **Gameplay/Key Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech bicycle powered by a Rotom that serves as the primary method of rapid overworld transportation in the Galar region. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Unique Acquisition**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Significantly increases the player's movement speed while exploring the overworld. Unlike previous generations' bicycles, this model features a **Turbo Boost** mechanic: as the player pedals, the Rotom generates electricity, allowing for a temporary burst of extreme speed when triggered (cooldown applies).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility-only item designed for overworld traversal and has no impact on competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Mode Shifting:** The bike eventually gains the ability to travel across the surface of water (Water Mode) upon reaching Route 9, replacing the need for the HM "Surf."
    * **Customization:** The bike's appearance can be modified by NPCs (Bike Gourmets) found in the Wild Area to change its color or the player's cycling outfit.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a mandatory story event on **Route 5** in *Pokémon Sword and Shield* after the player assists a doctor being harassed by Team Yell. It is later upgraded to cross water on **Route 9**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not available on wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of technology that utilizes Rotom’s ability to inhabit and power electronic appliances, marking a shift from HMs (Hidden Machines) to Rotom-integrated utility tools.
