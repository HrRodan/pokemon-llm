## Identity & Utility
**Hoothoot Feather** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A feather dropped by members of the Hoothoot evolutionary line. It is a consumable crafting resource used exclusively at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any tactical advantage.
* **Cost:** 15 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Fodder value; generally more valuable as a crafting ingredient than as a source of income).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient to craft Technical Machines (TMs). Players must combine these feathers with League Points (LP) to manifest specific moves. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats; its value is strictly limited to the "Pre-Battle" preparation phase where players customize move-sets for their team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the Gen IX crafting ecosystem designed to replace the infinite-use TM system of previous generations.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dropped by wild **Hoothoot** and **Noctowl** upon being defeated or captured in battle. It is also a common reward for defeating these Pokémon in Tera Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not traditionally "held" by the Pokémon in the overworld. Instead, it is added directly to the player's "TM Materials" inventory pocket upon the successful conclusion of an encounter with the Hoothoot line. It is effectively gathered through hunting or farming specific habitats where Hoothoot appear at night.
