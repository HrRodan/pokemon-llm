## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (CnC3268)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a special, consumable event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a single-use consumable that functions as an encounter trigger rather than a traditional battle item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Placeholder**). While it has a internal cost value, these items are generally not available for purchase in-game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair. Specifically, this crystal (CnC3268) was distributed via serial code to facilitate a raid against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) utility item used solely to encounter Pokémon with potential Hidden Abilities, high IVs, or Gigantamax factors. It has no application in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** node in the Wild Area. It does not evolve Pokémon or interact with battle abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Event Only.** These crystals were primarily distributed through promotional serial codes (such as those from retail partners like GameStop, CoroCoro, or Target). They cannot be obtained through standard gameplay or Pokémon Marts. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only distribution item meant to drive engagement with the Max Raid Battle mechanic.
