## Identity & Utility
**Ketchup** is a **Sandwich-Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A classic, tangy condiment used primarily during the Picnic mechanic. It is a **Consumable** ingredient that can be purchased in bulk for culinary experimentation.
* **Cost:** 110 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a condiment in a sandwich, Ketchup alters the resulting **Meal Powers**. Specifically, it contributes to several Power types, most notably providing boosts toward **Flying-type** or **Poison-type** meal attributes depending on the other ingredients paired with it.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively used in battle as a held item).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly restricted to the "overworld" Picnic mechanic. It is essential for players looking to optimize "Egg Power" (for breeding) or "Sparkling Power" (for Shiny hunting) through specific sandwich recipes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of many culinary items used to interact with the **Sandwich-making minigame**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized grocery retailers across the Paldea region, such as **Deli Cioso**, **Sure Cans**, and **Aquiesta Supermarket**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased or occasionally received as a reward from NPC sandwich enthusiasts. Unlike berries or medicine, it cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability.
