## Identity & Utility
**TM215 (Scorching Sands)** is a **Technical Machine** introduced in **Generation IX** as part of the *The Indigo Disk* DLC for Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
* **Description:** A Move Machine that provides a Pokémon with the knowledge of the move **Scorching Sands**. It is a **Consumable/Single-use** machine (within the context of the TM Machine crafting system) that allows for the permanent teaching of a powerful Ground-type move to compatible Pokémon.
* **Cost:** **0 Poké Dollars**. In the Paldean and Blueberry Academy economies, this item is **Not for sale** via traditional marts; instead, it must be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials, or found as a collectible item in the Terarium.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Scorching Sands**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Scorching Sands is a **Special Ground-type move** with a Base Power of 70 and 100% Accuracy.
    * **Secondary Effect:** It has a **30% chance to burn the target**, making it the Ground-type equivalent to the move *Scald*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; TMs are generally not used for Fling strategies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility.** This move is a staple for Special-attacking Ground types and various Fire or Psychic types that lack physical Ground coverage. It is highly valued in both VGC and Smogon formats because it provides a reliable way to spread burns against physical attackers that would otherwise switch into Ground-type threats (such as Zacian-C or Great Tusk).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a teaching tool. It is part of the expanded TM library introduced in the late-game content of Generation IX.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in the **Blueberry Academy (Terarium)** region. It can be found as a physical Poké Ball item on the ground in the **Savanna Biosphere** or unlocked for crafting after defeating specific trainers or progressing through the *Indigo Disk* storyline.
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM at a TM Machine, the player typically requires:
    * **LP (League Points)**
    * **Sandile Scales**
    * **Silicobra Sand**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a human-made (or Academy-made) technological device used for training.
