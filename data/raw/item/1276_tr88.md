## Identity & Utility
**TR88 (Heat Crash)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a single-use move-teaching item that grants a Pokémon the move **Heat Crash**. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, reflecting a return to the classic consumable mechanic for high-value moves. 
* **Cost:** 6,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate). While it has a sell value, it is most commonly acquired through the **Watt Economy** in the Wild Area for approximately 3,000–5,000 Watts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Heat Crash** to compatible Pokémon. Heat Crash is a Physical Fire-type move that calculates damage based on the weight difference between the attacker and the defender. The heavier the user is compared to the target, the higher the base power (ranging from 40 to 120).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low). Using Fling with this item provides negligible utility.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Specific.** Heat Crash is a staple for exceptionally heavy physical attackers such as **Copperajah**, **Coalossal**, and **Snorlax**. However, its viability is limited by the fact that it fails against Dynamaxed targets (in Gen VIII) and deals minimal damage to other heavy-weight Pokémon (like Heavy Slam users).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon successful teaching.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR88 is primarily obtained by defeating Fire-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles** within the Wild Area. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** whose inventories rotate daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It is primarily "farmed" through the **Max Raid Battle** system or by accumulating Watts through Power Spots.
