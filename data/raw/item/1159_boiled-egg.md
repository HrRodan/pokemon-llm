## Identity & Utility
**Boiled Egg** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized culinary item used exclusively for cooking at a Pokémon Camp. It is a consumable ingredient that enhances dishes within the Curry Dex mechanic. While it cannot be used as a medicine or held item for battle benefits, it is essential for flavor completion.
* **Cost:** 2200 Poké Dollars (Moderately expensive for a single-use ingredient).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as the key ingredient in the Pokémon Camp cooking minigame, it results in the creation of **Boiled-Egg Curry**. Depending on the quality of the cooking and berries used, this dish restores Pokémon HP and PP, provides Experience Points, and increases the sociability/friendliness of the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low damage; no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no viability in competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) as it cannot be used during battle and provides no passive buffs. It is strictly an overworld/playthrough mechanic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is purely a component for the **Curry Dex** completionist mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Ingredients Sellers** located throughout the Galar Wild Area, the Isle of Armor, and the Crown Tundra. Their inventory rotates daily, making it a "common-but-cycling" acquisition.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which can be farmed via trees or the Pickup ability, the Boiled Egg must typically be purchased from vendors or occasionally received as a reward from NPCs after participating in a Camp.
