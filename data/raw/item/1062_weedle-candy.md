## Identity & Utility
**Weedle Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable packed with energy tailored to the biological makeup of the Weedle evolutionary line. When fed to a compatible Pokémon, it provides a permanent boost to all six primary stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed). It is a **Consumable Growth Item** that is generally not purchased through standard Marts but has a nominal sell value.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Increases all of a Pokémon's stats by 1 point per candy. In the context of *Let's Go* mechanics, this contributes to **Awakening Values (AVs)**. Unlike traditional Effort Values (EVs), there is no 510-point cap; a Pokémon can gain up to 200 points in every stat via these candies, making them significantly more powerful than their standard counterparts.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The item does not exist in games where the move Fling is compatible with species-specific candies).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Game-Specific.** This item is mandatory for competitive play within the *Let's Go* series (LGPE) and for completing "Master Trainer" challenges. However, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as the AV system and species-candies were not carried over to Generation VIII or IX.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted to the **Weedle evolutionary family**. It can only be used on **Weedle, Kakuna, and Beedrill**. 

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained primarily through the **Catching Loop** mechanics. Players receive these candies by catching many Weedle in a row (Catch Combos) or by transferring caught Weedle to **Professor Oak**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is a reward for wildlife management and research. It can also be obtained by walking a Weedle, Kakuna, or Beedrill using the **Poké Ball Plus** accessory.
* **Lore Context:** Unlike Rare Candies, which stimulate a level jump, Weedle Candies represent concentrated nutritional supplements that bring out the "hidden potential" of a specific species, reflecting the more streamlined training system of the Kanto reboot.
