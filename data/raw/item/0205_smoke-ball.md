## Identity & Utility
**Smoke Ball** is a **Competitive Held Item (Utility)** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** An item to be held by a Pokémon that creates a tactical distraction. It guarantees that the holder can flee from any encounter with a wild Pokémon, regardless of speed stats or trapping effects. It is a **Holdable** item that is **Active** during battle.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard Price**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by the active Pokémon, any attempt to "Run" from a wild battle will succeed with a 100% success rate. This bypasses the standard escape calculation which usually compares the Speed of the player's Pokémon to the wild opponent.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no effect in Trainer battles, VGC, or Smogon formats. Its value is strictly limited to overworld exploration and wild encounters.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is particularly valuable for bypassing "trapping" abilities in the wild, such as **Arena Trap**, **Shadow Tag**, or **Magnet Pull**, which would otherwise prevent a player from escaping. It is a staple for **Nuzlocke** challenges to safely navigate high-level grass patches.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually available for purchase at major Department Stores (like Celadon or Lilycove) or found in locations associated with ninjas, smog, or industrial areas (e.g., Mauville City or the Burned Tower).
* **Wild Held Item:** It is naturally associated with Pokémon that produce smoke or gas. It can be found held by wild **Koffing**, **Weezing**, **Salandit**, and **Salazzle** (5% chance). Players can farm these using the **Frisk** ability or **Thief/Covet** moves.
* **Thematic Context:** The item represents a traditional smoke bomb, allowing a trainer to "vanish" from a confrontation, mirroring the moves *Smokescreen* or *Teleport*.
