## Identity & Utility
**Thick Club** is a **Species-Specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A hard, mysterious bone specifically designed to be wielded by the Cubone lineage. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that serves as a massive force multiplier for its specific users. While it has a technical cost, it is rarely obtainable through traditional commerce.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap**, though primarily obtained through wild encounters rather than retail).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by **Cubone** or **Marowak** (including Alolan Marowak), it **doubles** the holder’s raw Attack stat. This boost is applied to the stat itself, not as a move modifier, allowing it to stack with other buffs.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** **90** (High). Dealing significant physical damage when thrown, though this consumes the item and removes the Attack boost.
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche Powerhouse.** The Thick Club is mandatory for any competitive Marowak set. It elevates Marowak’s Attack to levels exceeding most Legendary Pokémon, making Alolan Marowak a premier "Wallbreaker" in formats like Trick Room. Its primary weakness is its reliance on the item; if the Thick Club is removed via **Knock Off** or swapped via **Trick**, Marowak's offensive presence is neutralized.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is one of the few items that specifically targets a single evolutionary line for a percentage-based stat increase.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Generally unavailable for purchase in Poké Marts. It is typically found as a rare treasure in mountainous or cavernous regions where ground-type Pokémon reside.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is famously farmed from wild **Cubone** and **Marowak** (including Alolan and Totem variants). Experienced trainers often use Pokémon with the **Compound Eyes** ability (to increase hold rates) and the move **Thief** or **Covet** to harvest these clubs from wild populations.
