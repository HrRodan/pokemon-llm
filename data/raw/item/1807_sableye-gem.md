## Identity & Utility
**Sableye Gem** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A fragment or jewel dropped by the Darkness Pokémon, Sableye. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** used at the TM Machine. Unlike traditional held items, this item is stored in a dedicated materials pocket and is used as currency for move acquisition. It cannot be bought from standard Marts but can be sold.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard material value).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine located at Pokémon Centers. Players must combine these gems with League Points (LP) to create moves like **TM094 (Dark Pulse)**, **TM114 (Shadow Ball)**, or other gems/dark-themed techniques compatible with Sableye's movepool.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists purely within the crafting economy of the Paldea region and has no impact on competitive battle stats or strategy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is not an evolution stone and does not trigger any form changes. It is a static resource item.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained by defeating or catching wild **Sableye**. 
* **Wild Held Item:** While not a held item in the traditional sense of past generations, it is a guaranteed or high-probability drop awarded at the end of an encounter with wild **Sableye**. It is most commonly farmed in cave biomes, ruins, or underground areas where Sableye are known to dwell. It does not interact with the **Pickup** ability, as it belongs to the Gen IX specific "Materials" loot table.
