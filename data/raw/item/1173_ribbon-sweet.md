## Identity & Utility
**Ribbon Sweet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A delicate, ribbon-shaped confectionary designed for a specific evolutionary process. It is a **Held Item** that serves as a catalyst for Milcery's transformation. While it has a nominal value, it is primarily obtained through gameplay challenges rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap, though its value lies in its rarity as a reward rather than its purchase price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by **Milcery**, the Ribbon Sweet allows the Pokémon to evolve into **Alcremie**. The evolution is triggered when the trainer performs a "Spin" (rotating the movement stick) in the overworld. The Ribbon Sweet determines the specific "decoration" on the resulting Alcremie's head.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item has **no competitive utility in battle**. Its function is purely for evolution. Once Milcery evolves, the Ribbon Sweet is consumed, and the resulting Alcremie's form (specifically its decorative ornament) is permanent. Alcremie itself is used in competitive VGC as a niche support (utilizing the move *Decorate*), but the sweet choice is purely aesthetic.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is one of seven "Sweet" varieties. Unlike the common Strawberry Sweet, the Ribbon Sweet (along with the Star Sweet) was historically rarer, often restricted to special Max Raid Battle events or specific RNG-based rewards like the Cram-o-matic or Item Printer.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, it is primarily rewarded by defeating **Battle Café** masters (random drop). In the Paldea region (DLC), it can be obtained via the **Item Printer** in the Blueberry Academy.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a crafted or specialty item.
* **Evolutionary Context:** The Ribbon Sweet is the final touch for "Ribbon Cream" variants of Alcremie. Because Alcremie has 63 possible flavor/sweet combinations, the Ribbon Sweet is a critical component for collectors seeking to complete the "Alcremie Dex."
