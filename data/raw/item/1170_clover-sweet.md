## Identity & Utility
**Clover-sweet** is an **Evolution Item** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A decorative, clover-shaped confection. It is a specialized evolution catalyst that, when held by the Pokémon **Milcery**, triggers a unique evolutionary process based on the trainer's movements. It is a consumable evolution item that is generally acquired through gameplay rewards rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 500 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard, though acquisition is usually via specific NPCs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Facilitates the evolution of **Milcery into Alcremie**. While a Milcery holds the Clover Sweet, the player must perform a "Spin" (rapidly rotating the joystick) in the overworld. The resulting Alcremie will permanently wear **Clover-shaped decorations** in its cream. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very Low damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item provides no stat boosts or tactical advantages in battle; its utility is strictly limited to the evolution and cosmetic customization of Alcremie.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This is one of seven "Sweets" used to determine Alcremie's decoration. The evolution is unique because it consumes the item and depends on the time of day, spin direction, and spin duration to determine the cream flavor (e.g., Vanilla, Ruby Cream, Matcha, etc.), while the Clover Sweet specifically dictates the "topping."

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, Clover Sweets are primarily obtained as rewards for defeating the **Battle Café Master** in Motostoke, Hammerlocke, or Wyndon (once per day). They can also be produced via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor or found as rewards in specific Max Raid Battles.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is an artificial item crafted for Pokémon consumption and aesthetic appeal.
