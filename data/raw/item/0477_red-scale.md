## Identity & Utility
**Red Scale** is a **Plot Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in Generation II (featured here in its Generation IV remake context).
* **Description:** A vibrant, glowing scale shed by the Red Gyarados of the Lake of Rage. It emits a flame-like radiance. As a Key Item, it is **Consumable (via trade)** and **Cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Red Scale serves as a trade token. When delivered to **Mr. Pokémon** at his house north of Cherrygrove City, he will exchange it for an **Exp. Share**, a vital utility item that allows a non-participating Pokémon to gain experience points in battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **N/A**. This item exists purely for single-player progression and to provide the player with an early-to-mid-game experience management tool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution directly, it is the physical proof of the encounter with the **Shiny Gyarados**, a Pokémon famously forced into premature evolution by Team Rocket’s radio waves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Automatically obtained by the player after battling (catching or defeating) the **Red Gyarados** at the Lake of Rage in the Johto region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a fixed encounter drop. It cannot be found via the **Pickup** ability.
* **Context:** In the Johto narrative, the Red Scale is a significant artifact that draws the interest of researchers like Mr. Pokémon and Professor Oak, as it represents the first major canon appearance of "Shiny" (alternately colored) Pokémon in the series.
