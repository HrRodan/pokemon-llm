## Identity & Utility
**Houndour Fang** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fragment of a fang dropped by a member of the Houndour evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Ingredient** that can be sold for small amounts of currency or used at the Technical Machine Machine.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Resource-grade). In Paldea, it is primarily valued at **40 League Points (LP)** when exchanged.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific crafting component required to create Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists outside of the competitive hold-item meta; its value is strictly tied to the Paldean crafting economy and move-pool expansion for a trainer's roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed during the crafting process for the following TMs (recipe-dependent):
    * **TM003 (Fake Tears)**
    * **TM006 (Scary Face)**
    * **TM030 (Snarl)**

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Pokémon in the Houndour family.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is not a held item, but a guaranteed or high-probability drop from:
    * **Houndour**
    * **Houndoom**
* **Lore Context:** In the Paldea region, the biological remains of Pokémon (like fangs, fur, or scales) are repurposed into digitized move-teaching data. As Houndour is a Dark/Fire-type, its fangs are essential for crafting TMs that involve intimidation, biting, or vocal-based debuffs.
