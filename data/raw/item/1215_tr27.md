## Identity & Utility
**TR27 (Sleep Talk)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon the move **Sleep Talk**. Unlike Technical Machines (TMs) in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) are consumable and break after one use. 
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). While it has a sell price, it is primarily traded for Watts (W) in its debut generation.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Sleep Talk**. While the user is asleep, this move allows them to randomly execute one of their other three known moves.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low damage; no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High (Strategic Staple).** TR27 is the cornerstone of the "RestTalk" strategy. By pairing Sleep Talk with the move *Rest*, a Pokémon can fully restore its HP and status, then continue to attack or set up while asleep, effectively nullifying the loss of momentum usually caused by the Sleeping status condition.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** No direct evolution properties. It is highly valued on bulky walls or "tank" Pokémon (e.g., Snorlax, Milotic, or Hippowdon) that rely on longevity.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR27 is frequently found as a reward for defeating Normal-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for 2,000 Watts (price fluctuates based on daily inventory).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured mechanical item and must be obtained through raids or specialized vendors.
