## Identity & Utility
**Primarium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** A crystallized form of Z-Power that acts as a specialized held item. It is specific to the final evolution of the Water-type starter from the Alola region. Unlike standard items, it is a **Special Acquisition** that cannot be bought, sold, or consumed.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; unique story/event item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a **Primarina** that knows the move **Sparkling Aria**, it allows the Pokémon to upgrade that move into the exclusive Z-Move: **Oceanic Operetta**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with the move Fling).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple (Gen 7)**. In Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Ultra Moon, this item was the primary reason to use Primarina in competitive singles and doubles. It transforms a standard base 90 power move into a massive base 195 power Water-type nuke that ignores traditional damage reduction mechanics associated with standard moves.
    *   **Immunity:** While held, this item cannot be removed by moves like *Knock Off* or *Thief*, and cannot be traded away via *Trick* or *Switcheroo*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is exclusive to **Primarina**. It has no effect when held by its pre-evolutions, Popplio or Brionne.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, the player receives this crystal from **Hau** (if the player chose Popplio) or from the Trial Captain **Lana** after defeating the Elite Four. In *Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*, it is obtained during the post-game after defeating Lana in her house in Konikoni City.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. As a Z-Crystal, it is a unique item tied to the trainer's Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring.
* **Lore context:** The move it creates, *Oceanic Operetta*, depicts Primarina using its voice to control a massive orb of water, which it then detonates over the target—emphasizing Primarina's role as the "Soloist Pokémon."
