## Identity & Utility
**Poltchageist Powder** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Teal Mask).
* **Description:** A fragment of tea-like dust dropped by Poltchageist or Sinistcha. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency or exchanged at the TM Machine. It is not intended for use as a medicine or a held item in battle.
* **Cost:** 30 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). While it can be sold, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting reagent.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item serves as a specific ingredient required to craft Technical Machines (TMs) at the TM Machine found at Pokémon Centers. It is consumed during the crafting process alongside League Points (LP).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be effectively used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no direct impact on competitive stats, abilities, or moves. Its value is purely preparatory, allowing players to teach powerful moves to their roster.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it is a material dropped by the Poltchageist line, it is **not** used to evolve Poltchageist (which requires the Unremarkable Teacup or Masterpiece Teacup). It has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained in the **Kitakami** region. It is rewarded to the player after defeating or catching wild **Poltchageist** or **Sinistcha**.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item does not appear as a standard held item. Instead, it is a **guaranteed drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter with the Poltchageist evolutionary line.
* **Lore Context:** Poltchageist is a convergent species resembling Sinistea, but it is actually a ghost inhabiting a container of matcha powder. The "powder" collected is the residue of this haunted matcha, highly sought after for its unique properties in generating move-teaching data for the TM Machine.
