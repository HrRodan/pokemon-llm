## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Cap7776** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. When used, it triggers a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon (indicated by the internal ID `cap7776`) that remains active until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that is generally not available through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this item is typically distributed via serial codes or special events rather than sold in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to spawn a red beam. This initiates a Max Raid Battle with a specific, often rare or Gigantamax-capable Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld to facilitate encounters and cannot be used in ranked or VGC battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon directly, but often provides an encounter with a Pokémon possessing the **Gigantamax Factor**, which cannot be obtained through normal evolution without the Max Soup (DLC).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is an **Event-Exclusive Distribution**. In *Pokémon Sword and Shield*, Dynamax Crystals were primarily distributed through physical retail partnerships (such as GameStop or Target) or as pre-order bonuses.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally received via the **Mystery Gift** function using a specific serial code.
* **Lore Context:** The item serves as a beacon, focusing Galar Particles into a specific den to force a Dynamax encounter. The "Cap" designation in the name typically refers to promotional tie-ins or specific serial code batches used during the Generation VIII live-service period.
