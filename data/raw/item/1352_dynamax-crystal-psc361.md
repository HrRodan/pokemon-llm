## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal PSC361** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A rare, single-use event item used at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. Once consumed, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Inexpensive/Nominal**; while it has a defined internal cost, it is technically an event-exclusive item and not sold in Poké Marts).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch sub-area of the Wild Area), this crystal activates a Max Raid Battle. Specifically, the **PSC361** variant was distributed via serial codes to encounter a **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is used exclusively in the overworld to facilitate a raid encounter. It has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or standard trainer battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, it provides a guaranteed method to encounter and catch a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which otherwise requires significant RNG or Max Soup from the Isle of Armor DLC.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed as a promotional event item. Specifically, this crystal was often part of retail collaborations (such as those with GameStop or Micromania) or pre-order bonuses to give players early access to Gigantamax encounters. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly tied to external distribution methods.
