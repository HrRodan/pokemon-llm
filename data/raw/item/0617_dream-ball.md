## Identity & Utility
**Dream Ball** is a **Special Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** Originally a specialized tool that appeared automatically in the player's Bag when entering the Entree Forest to capture Pokémon from the Pokémon Dream World. It is a **Consumable Catching Item** that **cannot be bought** via standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition/Event Only**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** 
    * **In Generation V:** It has a 100% catch rate (guaranteed capture) but is strictly limited to encounters within the Entree Forest. 
    * **In Modern Generations (World Knowledge):** Its mechanics were updated for standard gameplay. It now functions as a specialized capture tool with a **4× Catch Rate modifier** if the target Pokémon is currently **Asleep** (SLP). Otherwise, it has a standard 1× modifier.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard Poké Balls cannot be used with the move Fling for damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it provides no combat stats, it is highly prized in the competitive and trading communities as a **"Rare Ball" or "Bank Ball."** Pokémon in Dream Balls are often sought after because, historically, they were the only way to obtain certain species with their **Hidden Abilities**. 
    * **Aesthetics:** Upon being sent into battle, it releases a signature pink smoke and hazy purple mist effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of the few balls (alongside the Master Ball) that historically bypassed the standard catch rate calculation entirely in its debut generation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Legacy:** Automatically obtained in the Entree Forest (Black/White, Black 2/White 2) when encountering Pokémon transferred from the Global Link Dream World.
    * **Modern:** Extremely rare. In recent titles (Gen VIII & IX), it is typically obtained as a one-time reward (e.g., from the Pokédex completion tasks), through the Porto Marinada Auction as a high-priced rarity, or via the Cram-o-matic.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a "Specialty Ball" that must be gifted to or found by the trainer. Documented as a "non-commercial" ball produced for specific inter-dimensional research contexts.
