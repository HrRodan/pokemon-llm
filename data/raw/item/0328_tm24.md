## Identity & Utility
**TM24** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** categorized under **All-Machines**. While its metadata associates it with Generation III, it has been a staple item across every major region from Kanto to Paldea.
* **Description:** A data-encoding disc used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Depending on the game version, it teaches high-value offensive or utility moves. It is a **Consumable** (in older generations) or **Reusable** (in mid-to-late generations) utility item.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). In games where TMs are reusable, this price is often associated with the TM's value in shops or its resale price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a Pokémon. 
    * **Thunderbolt:** In most generations (Gen I, III–VII, and Gen IX), TM24 teaches **Thunderbolt**, a premier Electric-type move with 90 Power and 100% Accuracy, featuring a 10% chance to paralyze the target.
    * **DragonBreath:** In Generation II, this TM teaches the Dragon-type move DragonBreath.
    * **Snore:** In Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), as indicated by the flavor text, it teaches **Snore**, a 50-power Normal-type move that can only be used while the user is asleep and has a 30% flinch chance.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling, or have no base power if they can).
    * **Competitive Use:** When teaching **Thunderbolt**, this item is a **Top-Tier Essential**. Thunderbolt is the gold standard for Electric-type coverage, utilized by nearly every Special Attacker capable of learning it (e.g., Starmie, Gengar, Magearna) to threaten Water and Flying types. When teaching **Snore**, its utility is **Niche**, restricted to specific "Sleep Talk" or "Rest" defensive sets.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a wide array of Pokémon, primarily Electric, Normal, and "Special Attacker" archetypes.

## Acquisition & Lore

* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be found, earned, or purchased by the Trainer.
* **Lore:** TMs represent the technological advancement of Pokémon training, allowing trainers to bypass natural level-up limitations to customize their team's movepools for competitive advantage.
