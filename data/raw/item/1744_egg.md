## Identity & Utility
**Egg** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A common culinary ingredient used exclusively in the sandwich-making mechanic during Picnics. It is a consumable food item and should not be confused with the "Pokémon Egg" used for breeding. It is primarily used to craft recipes that provide specific Meal Powers to the player.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When added to a sandwich, the Egg ingredient contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. Specifically, it is a key component for boosting **Exp. Point Power**, **Encounter Power**, and **Raid Power** (often associated with Flying, Rock, or Ice types depending on the combination of other ingredients).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Non-competitive. Its utility is restricted to the overworld Picnic system to facilitate shiny hunting, experience grinding, or Tera Raid preparation.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no interaction with Pokémon evolution. It interacts solely with the **Picnic/Sandwich** UI mechanic.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Mass-market grocery item. It can be purchased at **Sure Cans** outlets and **Aquiesta Supermarkets** found in major cities like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Unlike organic items found in the wild, this is a processed ingredient gathered via the Paldean retail economy.
