## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Cen5267)** is a **Specialized Consumable** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** This is a rare, event-exclusive item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. By offering it at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, a beacon of light is activated, allowing players to face a specific Gigantamax Pokémon. It is a **Consumable** item that, once used, persists only until the end of the day. 
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**). While the JSON indicates a low cost, this item is not available in standard Poké Marts; the value is a placeholder for an item primarily obtained through external serial codes.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Triggers a Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area). Specifically, the **Cen5267** crystal is associated with an encounter with **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an acquisition-oriented item used to catch Pokémon with Rare Marks, Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax factors. It has no utility in a competitive VGC or Smogon battle setting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not trigger evolution but provides access to a Pokémon capable of the Gigantamax transformation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed as a **promotional event item**. In various regions, these crystals were given away via serial codes at retailers (such as GameStop or EB Games) to celebrate specific expansions of the Trading Card Game (TCG) or movie releases. 
* **Location-Specific:** It can only be used at one specific location: the empty raid den in the **Watchtower Ruins** of the Galar Wild Area. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it is strictly an event-tier distribution item.
