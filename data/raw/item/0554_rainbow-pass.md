## Identity & Utility
**Rainbow Pass** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (specifically *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*).
* **Description:** An upgraded ferry ticket for the Seagallop High-Speed Longliner, featuring a colorful rainbow illustration. It serves as a permanent permit for travel between the Kanto mainland (Vermilion City) and all regions of the Sevii Islands. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Grants the player unrestricted access to all seven of the **Sevii Islands**. While the initial *Tri-Pass* only allows travel between Islands 1, 2, and 3, the Rainbow Pass unlocks the post-game content found on Islands 4, 5, 6, and 7.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for world navigation and plot progression. It cannot be held by Pokémon in a competitive setting.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The Rainbow Pass is the mechanical gatekeeper for the post-game "Network Machine" quest. Obtaining it is a prerequisite for finding the Sapphire plate, which eventually enables cross-regional trading with the Hoenn region (Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald versions).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Acquired as a story-essential item. It is gifted to the player by **Celio** at the Pokémon Network Center on One Island. This occurs after the player has defeated the Elite Four, obtained the National Pokédex, and returned the **Ruby** to him.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is a unique, one-of-a-kind key item tied to the player's trainer ID.
* **Lore Context:** The item represents the player's expanded influence and recognized heroism in the Kanto region, providing the means to explore the more dangerous and remote reaches of the Sevii archipelago, including the habitat of legendary Pokémon like Mewtwo (Cerulean Cave access is often tied to this questline progression) and the legendary birds.
