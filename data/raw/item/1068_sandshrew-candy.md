## Identity & Utility
**Sandshrew Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine designed for the Sandshrew evolutionary line. Unlike generic stat boosters, this candy is "packed with energy" that targets the specific genetic makeup of a single species family. It is a **Consumable** item that can technically be sold, though it is rarely bought.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**). Its primary value lies in its growth utility rather than its resale price.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Sandshrew** or **Sandslash** (including their **Alolan forms**), it increases all six of the Pokémon’s stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by **1 point** simultaneously. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is exclusive to the **Awakening Value (AV)** system used in the *Let's Go* series. It is not used in traditional Smogon or VGC formats. Within the *Let's Go* competitive meta, species-specific candies are the most efficient way to reach the maximum cap of +200 in every stat, as they bypass the level requirements and attribute limits of standard size-based candies (Quick Candy, Tough Candy, etc.).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is functionally a "super-vitamin" that provides a balanced spread of permanent stat boosts.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (LGPE) by **transferring Sandshrew or Sandslash to Professor Oak**. It is also frequently rewarded for achieving high "Catch Combos" of wild Sandshrew or by walking with a Sandshrew in the Poké Ball Plus accessory.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. Instead, it is gathered through the **Capture/Research mechanic**, representing the byproduct of studying the species. In the context of the game's economy, it serves as the primary reward for "farming" the Sandshrew line to optimize a single powerful team member.
