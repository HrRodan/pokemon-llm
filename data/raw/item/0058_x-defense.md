## Identity & Utility
**X-Defense** is a **Stat-Boosting Consumable** introduced in **Generation I** (metadata indicates persistent availability through Generation IV and beyond).
* **Description:** A battle-only supplement designed to reinforce a Pokémon's physical durability. It is a **consumable** item that is **bought and sold** at standard Poké Marts. While it can be held by a Pokémon, it provides no passive benefit; it must be manually used by the Trainer during a turn.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Priced**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag during a battle, it raises the active Pokémon's **Defense stat**. 
    * *Mechanical Evolution:* Traditionally, this item raised the stat by **one stage**. However, as noted in the Sun/Moon flavor text, modern iterations (Generation VII onward) "sharply" boost the stat, increasing it by **two stages** (+100%).
    * **Happiness:** Using this item also provides a minor boost to the Pokémon's friendship/happiness level (1/1/0 scale).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Non-existent in standard Competitive Play** (e.g., VGC, Smogon), as Trainers cannot use items from their Bag during these matches.
    * **Nuzlocke/Playthrough Utility:** Highly valuable in **Nuzlocke challenges** or difficult boss fights (like Totem Pokémon or Elite Four) to allow a Pokémon to "setup" and tank physical hits that would otherwise result in a knockout.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is countered by the ability **Unaware** (which ignores the stat boost) and can be cleared by the move **Haze** or by switching the Pokémon out of battle.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at **Poké Marts** and **Department Stores** (such as the Celadon Dept. Store or Goldenrod Dept. Store) once the player has earned a specific number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily a manufactured pharmaceutical item. It is frequently found as a hidden item or "Poké Ball" loot in caves and mountainous routes where physical attackers are prevalent.
* **Economic Value:** At 2000 Poké Dollars, it is more expensive than basic healing items but serves as a strategic investment for surviving "sweepers" in the mid-to-late game.
