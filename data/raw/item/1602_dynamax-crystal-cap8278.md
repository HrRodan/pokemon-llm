## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Cap8278** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that lasts until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap, though typically acquired via external promotional codes rather than shops).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Activating this crystal at the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell sub-region of the Wild Area) causes a specific Dynamax Pokémon to appear as a Max Raid Battle boss. Unlike standard dens, this raid is guaranteed and specific to the crystal's ID (in this case, code 'Cap8278').
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no function in trainer-vs-trainer battles and cannot be held by a Pokémon. Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of catching rare or promotional Pokémon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is consumed upon the successful spawning of the raid, regardless of whether the Pokémon is defeated or caught.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail promotions (such as those from GameStop, Target, or international equivalents) or as bonuses for purchasing specific merchandise/expansion passes.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a "Special Acquisition" item meant to bridge the gap between real-world promotions and in-game encounters.
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals represent concentrated Galar Particles. While most Wishing Pieces attract random entities from the Power Spot network, these specific crystals act as "beacons" for specific, high-value targets.
