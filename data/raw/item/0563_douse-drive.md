## Identity & Utility
**Douse Drive** is a **Species-specific Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A high-tech cassette designed specifically for the Mythical Pokémon Genesect. When held, it modifies the appearance of the light on Genesect’s back (the "buster") to a distinct blue color. It is a **Held Item** that **cannot be bought** in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; typically obtained as a Key Item or via a special NPC event).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held by Genesect, its signature move, **Techno Blast**, changes from a Normal-type move to a **Water-type** move.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (The item is consumed upon use, but provides no additional secondary effect beyond damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **niche item**. While it provides Genesect with valuable Water-type coverage to hit its primary 4x weakness (Fire) and Ground-types, it is often overlooked in competitive play (Smogon/Ubers) in favor of items that boost Genesect's overall power or speed, such as *Choice Scarf*, *Choice Band*, or *Life Orb*.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is functionally useless if not held by **Genesect**. It does not trigger evolution; rather, it acts as a form-augmenting item similar to Silvally’s Memories or Arceus’s Plates.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually obtained through specific story events or NPCs when Genesect is shown to them. In its debut region (Unova), it is found at the **P2 Laboratory** after defeating a specific scientist. In later generations, it is typically handed out by "Item Maniacs" or special vendors in markets (e.g., Stow-on-Side in Galar).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique laboratory-developed artifact linked to Team Plasma's experimentation on Genesect.
