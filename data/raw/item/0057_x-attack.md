## Identity & Utility
**X-Attack** is a **Stat-Boost** consumable introduced in Generation I (refined in Generation IV and VII).
* **Description:** An item designed for temporary tactical enhancement during a Pokémon battle. It is a **Consumable** item used from the Trainer's bag that provides an immediate offensive surge. While it can be "held," it has no effect when held by a Pokémon and must be manually activated by the Trainer.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Mid-range/Accessible**). It is a standard inventory staple for mid-to-late game progression.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag during battle, it raises the target Pokémon's **Attack stat**. 
    * *Generational Shift:* While early data cites a one-stage increase, as of Generation VII (Sun/Moon), this item **sharply boosts** the Attack stat by **two stages (+2)**.
    * *Secondary Effect:* Using this item also increases the Pokémon’s **Happiness/Friendship** by a small margin (1 point in most scenarios).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage, no additional status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Playthrough/Nuzlocke Essential.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), items used from the bag are prohibited. However, in "Items-On" single-player runs, it is a core tool for "sweeping" Gym Leaders or the Elite Four by allowing a physical attacker to bypass defensive walls.
* **Interaction:** The stat boost is temporary and is lost if the Pokémon is switched out of battle or if the battle ends. It interacts with the ability **Simple** (doubling the boost to +4) or **Contrary** (causing an Attack drop instead).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly purchased at **Pokémon Marts** (after obtaining a certain number of Gym Badges) and **Department Stores** (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove, Veilstone). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is generally not held by wild Pokémon; it is a manufactured pharmaceutical item. It is frequently found as a "hidden item" in the overworld using the Itemfinder or Item Dowsing machine.
* **Strategic Context:** Part of the "X-Item" family (including X-Defense, X-Speed, etc.), the X-Attack is the primary choice for physical "Glass Cannons" who need to secure One-Hit-KOs (OHKOs) to avoid taking damage in return.
