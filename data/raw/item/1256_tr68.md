## Identity & Utility
**TR68 (Nasty Plot)** is a **Technical Record (Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach the move **Nasty Plot**. The user stimulates its brain by thinking "bad thoughts," which sharply raises its Special Attack stat (+2 stages). Unlike traditional TMs in most generations, a TR is a **Consumable** item that breaks after one use.
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Significant). While it has a defined currency value, it is primarily acquired via non-standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Nasty Plot** to a compatible Pokémon. Nasty Plot is a non-damaging Dark-type move that increases the user's Special Attack by two stages (100% increase), making it one of the premier setup moves in the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Nasty Plot is essential for Special Sweepers (such as Gengar, Togekiss, Hydreigon, and Thundurus-Therian) to bypass defensive walls. In the Gen VIII VGC and Smogon metas, access to this TR was a defining factor in a Pokémon's offensive viability.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Consumed upon use. It cannot be used to trigger evolutions. It is categorized under "All-Machines," specifically functioning within the Galar region's machine system.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR68 is primarily obtained by trading **Watts (W)** with Watt Traders located throughout the Wild Area (typically costing 3,000–5,000 Watts depending on the trader and daily rotation). It is also a common reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Dark or Psychic-type Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through Max Raid Battles or specific vendors, making it a resource that requires active "farming" in the Wild Area or Crown Tundra.
