## Identity & Utility
**Moomoo-cheese** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** A specialty culinary item used exclusively in the Pokémon Camp "Curry Dex" mechanic. It is described as a rich, meltable cheese that enhances the flavor and texture of curries. It is a **Consumable** item that can be bought from specific vendors.
* **Cost:** 2200 Poké Dollars (**Moderately Expensive** for a single-use cooking ingredient).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as the main ingredient in Pokémon Camp, it produces **Cheese Curry** variants. The outcome depends on the Berry selection used alongside it, resulting in various ratings (Koffing-class up to Charizard-class). Consuming the resulting curry restores HP, PP, and increases the Pokémon's Friendliness and Experience Points.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 20 (Low utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no viable application in VGC or Smogon formats, as its primary function is restricted to the Camp sub-menu and provides no benefit when held in a standard battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It is purely a social and restorative mechanic item. It interacts with the **Curry Dex**, filling entries #73 through #78 depending on the flavor profile of the Berries used.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily purchased from **Ingredient Sellers** located in the Galar Wild Area (e.g., Meetup Spot, Hammerlocke Hills). Their inventory rotates daily, making it a semi-common but inconsistent find. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Moomoo Milk, which is often associated with Miltank, Moomoo-cheese is a processed good and must be acquired through commerce rather than foraging or the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore Context:** The name "Moomoo" identifies this as a dairy product derived from Moomoo Milk, produced by Miltank. This establishes a brand consistency that spans from the Johto region to Galar, suggesting a robust inter-regional agricultural trade for dairy products.
