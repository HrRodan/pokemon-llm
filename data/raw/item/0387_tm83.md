## Identity & Utility
**TM83** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A data-encoding disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. In its debut generation, it contained **Natural Gift**, but from Generation V onwards, it was reassigned to teach **Work Up**. It is a **Consumable** item in its earliest and most recent iterations (Gen IV, VIII-BDSP, IX), while it was **Infinite Use** between Generations V and VII.
* **Cost:** 100,000 Poké Dollars (**Extremely Expensive**). This high price point typically reflects its status as a high-tier TM found in Department Stores or late-game Battle Facilities.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Generation IV:** Teaches **Natural Gift**, a physical attack where the power and type are determined by the user's held Berry (the Berry is consumed upon use).
    * **Generation V-VIII:** Teaches **Work Up**, a status move that raises both the user's Attack and Special Attack stats by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Standard for most Technical Machines).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Work Up:** A staple for **Mixed Attackers** (Pokémon that utilize both physical and special moves) like Lucario or Porygon-Z. It is highly valued in lower-tier competitive formats or during playthroughs to set up sweeps.
        * **Natural Gift:** Historically used as a "lure" or surprise coverage move. For example, a Grass-type using a Fire-type Natural Gift (via a Watmel Berry) to knock out an incoming Steel-type.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is subject to the **Klutz** ability (preventing use if the Pokémon were to hold it, though TMs are rarely held) and can be recycled/crafted in newer generations via the TM Machine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * In **Diamond/Pearl/Platinum**, it is available for purchase at the **Veilstone Department Store**.
    * In **Black/White**, it is gifted by a clerk in the **Straiton City** Trainer School after defeating the Gym Leaders.
    * In **Scarlet/Violet (The Indigo Disk)**, it can be found in the Terarium or crafted using the TM Machine.
* **Wild Held Item:** TM83 is never found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained through fixed world spawns, NPC rewards, or high-end retail locations within the Pokémon world.
