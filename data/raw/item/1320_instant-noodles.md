## Identity & Utility
**Instant Noodles** is a **Curry Ingredient** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized cooking ingredient used exclusively at Pokémon Camps. Described as having a "junk-food sort of taste," it is a consumable item used to influence the resulting dish in the Curry Dex. It cannot be used in battle or held for any passive effect.
* **Cost:** 150 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as the main ingredient in the Pokémon Camp cooking minigame, it produces **Instant Noodle Curry**. Depending on the berries added and the cooking performance, this restores the party's HP and PP, provides Experience Points, and increases the Pokémon's Friendliness/Sociability.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats; it is strictly a "Playthrough" mechanic for team maintenance and ribbon collecting (Curry Connoisseur).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is one of the many ingredients required to complete the 151-recipe Curry Dex in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold by **Ingredient Sellers** found throughout the Galar Wild Area, particularly at the Entrance and in the North Lake Miloch area. The inventory of these NPCs rotates daily.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike berries or medicine, these are primarily sourced through currency-based transactions or as rewards for interacting with other players' camps.
* **Context:** It represents a modern, convenience-food element of the Galar region’s culture, contrasting with more traditional ingredients like Moomoo Cheese or Boiled Eggs.
