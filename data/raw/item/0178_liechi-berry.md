## Identity & Utility
**Liechi-berry** is a **Stat-Raising Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A consumable botanical item that acts as a reactive held item. If a Pokémon holds this berry, it will be consumed automatically to boost the user's Attack stat when their health drops to a critical level (25% or less). It is a **Consumable Held Item** that is generally cultivated rather than bought in bulk.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars (**Inexpensive/Cheap**). Note: In most regions, this item cannot be purchased at standard Poké Marts and must be grown via soil patches or obtained through special encounters.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder's HP falls below **25%** (or 50% for Pokémon with the **Gluttony** ability), the berry is consumed to increase the Pokémon’s **Attack stat by one stage** (+1).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Triggers the Attack-raising effect on the target if hit).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Grass-type** move with **100 Base Power**.
    * **Competitive Use:** A high-tier **Competitive Staple** for "Pinch" sweepers. It is frequently paired with the moves **Substitute** or **Endure** to manually lower the user's HP to the activation threshold, enabling a sweep. It is particularly effective on physical attackers with high Speed but average Attack.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is significantly influenced by the ability **Unburden** (doubling Speed after consumption) and is countered by **Unnerve** (preventing consumption).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically rare; famously found on the elusive **Mirage Island** in the Hoenn region. In later generations, it is acquired through berry mutations (Gen VI), the Poke Pelago (Gen VII), or high-tier Raid Battles (Gen VIII).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not commonly found on wild Pokémon according to current records. Most trainers acquire it through **Berry Trees** or specialized cultivation mechanics. In Gen III, it was the rarest of the stat-boosting berries.
