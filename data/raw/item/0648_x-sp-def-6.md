## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Def 6** is a **Miracle Shooter Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** An advanced, high-potency battle booster used exclusively within the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic. Unlike standard X-Items which provide a single-stage boost (or two-stage in later generations), this item is designed to maximize a Pokémon's defensive profile instantly. It is a **Consumable Battle Item** that **Cannot** be bought or sold in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired via point accumulation during active Wonder Launcher battles).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a party Pokémon during battle, it raises the target’s **Special Defense by six stages**. This is the maximum possible stat stage increase (+300% of the base stat), effectively making the Pokémon nearly impervious to special attacks.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Restricted/Niche.** This item is only available in the "Wonder Launcher" battle sub-format of Generation V. Because it is a "Battle Item" (like Potions or standard X-Items), it is prohibited in standard VGC and Smogon competitive formats, which rely strictly on Held Items.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item has no impact on evolution. Like all stat boosts, the effect is cleared if the Pokémon is withdrawn from battle or if the move *Haze* is used.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in **Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2**. It does not occupy a space in the standard player bag for use in the overworld; instead, it is selected from the Wonder Launcher menu during multiplayer battles once the player has accumulated enough points over the course of the turns.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is a digital-only construct within the context of the Unova region's advanced battle technology.
