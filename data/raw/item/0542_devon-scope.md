## Identity & Utility
**Devon Scope** is a **Key Item** (Gameplay category) introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A specialized high-tech sensory device developed by the Devon Corporation. It is designed to signal the presence of Pokémon that are otherwise invisible to the naked eye. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot be bought or sold**.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Devon Scope allows the player to detect and unmask invisible **Kecleon** that block paths throughout the overworld. When the player interacts with an "invisible" space occupied by a Kecleon, the device reveals the Pokémon, initiating a battle and allowing the player to clear the obstruction.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item serves strictly as a narrative progression tool and has no utility in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The item is a mandatory progression tool. Its most famous use is to unmask the invisible Kecleon blocking the entrance to the **Fortree City Gym**, granting the player access to the Gym Leader, Winona.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Hoenn region (*Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, Omega Ruby, and Alpha Sapphire*), the Devon Scope is given to the player by **Steven Stone** on Route 120. This occurs after the player encounters Steven near a bridge and uses the device to reveal a Kecleon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is unique and is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a one-of-a-kind technological achievement by the Devon Corporation, the same entity responsible for the PokéNav and various experimental Poké Balls.
