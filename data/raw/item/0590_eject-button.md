## Identity & Utility
**Eject Button** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** A specialized strategic tool designed to be held by a Pokémon. If the holder is struck by a damaging move, it is immediately swapped out of battle for another team member of the Trainer's choosing. It is a **Consumable** item (single-use per battle) that can typically be purchased through specialized vendors rather than standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate/Special Acquisition—often associated with Battle Point [BP] exchanges in post-game facilities).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the holder takes direct damage from an attack and survives, it immediately switches out for another non-fainted Pokémon in the party. This effect does not activate if the holder is "trapped" by moves like *Mean Look* or abilities like *Shadow Tag*, or if the damage comes from indirect sources (status conditions, weather, or entry hazards).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Competitive Staple.** In VGC and Smogon formats, it is used for "pivoting." It allows a player to soak a hit and immediately bring in a counter or a "sweeper" without wasting a turn manually switching. It is frequently seen on bulky support Pokémon or Pokémon with the *Intimidate* ability to cycle debuffs quickly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is a single-use item; once triggered, it is consumed and removed from the holder for the remainder of the battle (unless recovered via the move *Recycle* or the ability *Harvest*).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Rarely found in the overworld. It is most commonly obtained via **Battle Facilities** (such as the Battle Subway, Battle Maison, or Battle Tower) using points earned through competitive wins. In later generations, it can occasionally be purchased at Delibird Presents or similar high-end boutiques.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** currently known to be held by any wild Pokémon species. It must be acquired through currency exchange or found as a specific hidden item in the game world. Generally unavailable via the **Pickup** ability.
