## Identity & Utility
**Careful Mint** is a **Nature-mint** consumable introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** When used on a Pokémon, it realigns its stat growth patterns to match the **Careful** nature. Specifically, it causes the Pokémon's **Special Defense** to increase more rapidly while its **Special Attack** increases more slowly. It is a consumable medicine that, while technically having a internal cost value of 20, is traditionally an exclusive endgame item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Extremely cheap in raw data, but traditionally acquired via high-value Battle Points [BP] or special rewards, making it a **High-Value/Exclusive** acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Modifies the stat modifiers of a Pokémon. It applies a **1.1x multiplier to Special Defense** and a **0.9x multiplier to Special Attack**. 
    * *Note:* The Pokémon’s actual Nature (e.g., Adamant, Jolly) remains unchanged on the status screen, but the stat highlights (blue/red text) and calculation logic will reflect the Careful Mint’s influence.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Negligible damage; no additional Fling effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Priority / Essential Staple.** The Careful Mint is vital for "bulky physical attackers" or "dedicated walls" that do not utilize special moves. It allows players to optimize Pokémon that were caught with sub-optimal natures (like Shinies or Legendaries) for competitive play in VGC or Smogon formats (e.g., making a **Corviknight** or **Snorlax** more resilient against Special moves).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is a "Quality of Life" item designed to bypass the need for intensive breeding for Natures.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained through the **Battle Tower** (purchasable for BP), found as rare drops in the **Wild Area**, or rewarded through **Max Raid Battles** and **Tera Raid Battles** (Gen IX). In the Isle of Armor, it can be generated via the **Cram-o-matic**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries or standard Medicines, these are processed herbal remedies used by high-level trainers to "fine-tune" a Pokémon's latent potential. It is generally gathered through endgame progression rather than the **Pickup** ability.
