## Identity & Utility
**Calm-mint** is a **Nature Mint** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized herbal item that, when consumed, alters a Pokémon's stat growth patterns. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that mimics the effects of the Calm nature. While it changes the Pokémon's stat highlights (Red for increase, Blue for decrease), the Pokémon's original innate Nature remains unchanged for breeding purposes.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible** in raw data, though historically rare and requiring Battle Points (BP) or high-level gameplay to acquire in-game).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Permanently modifies the Pokémon's stat growth to increase **Special Defense** by 10% and decrease **Attack** by 10%. This is ideal for defensive Pokémon that rely on special moves or support roles and do not utilize their physical Attack stat.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Essential Competitive Staple.** Mints revolutionized the competitive scene by allowing players to "fix" the stats of Legendary Pokémon, Shiny Pokémon, or gift Pokémon that were obtained with non-ideal Natures. The Calm Mint is specifically used for **Special Walls** (e.g., Umbreon, Sylveon, or Toxapex) to maximize their bulk against special attackers while minimizing damage taken from "Confusion" or the move "Foul Play."
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It bypasses the need for traditional "Nature Synchronizing" or soft-resetting during legendary encounters.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In its debut (Sword/Shield), it was primarily available at the **Battle Tower** for 50 BP. In later titles (Scarlet/Violet), it became more accessible at **Chansey Supply** shops after reaching certain Gym Badge milestones and can occasionally be found as a sparkling overworld item in high-level areas like the Area Zero or the Crown Tundra.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is an artificial or highly refined herbal remedy rather than a wild-grown berry, making it a "manufactured" competitive resource.
