## Identity & Utility
**Sapphire** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** An exquisitely beautiful gem characterized by a distinct blue glow, said to symbolize honesty. It is a **Key Item** that is vital to the post-game progression of *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*. It cannot be bought, sold, or held by Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**; unique quest item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Sapphire serves as the final component required by the programmer **Celio** to complete the **Network Machine** on One Island. When combined with the Ruby, it enables the Link Multicord, allowing the player to trade Pokémon with the Hoenn region (*Ruby, Sapphire, and Emerald*) and Orre region (*Colosseum and XD: Gale of Darkness*).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used in battle or held).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists strictly for plot progression and to unlock out-of-battle connectivity features.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Completion of this item's quest is the trigger for obtaining the **Rainbow Pass**, which grants access to the remaining Sevii Islands (Four, Five, Six, and Seven).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found deep within the **Dotted Hole on Six Island** in the Sevii Islands. The player must solve a Braille-based puzzle to reach it, only to have it initially stolen by Scientist Gideon, requiring a second confrontation at the Rocket Warehouse on Five Island.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a one-of-a-kind artifact tied to the game's narrative.
* **World Knowledge:** The Sapphire, alongside its counterpart the Ruby, represents the bridge between the Kanto and Hoenn regions. Its recovery is the canonical explanation for why Kanto-based trainers can finally communicate with trainers from the Hoenn region in the Generation III era.
