## Identity & Utility
**Jangmo-o Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea/Kitakami)**.
* **Description:** A specialized crafting component shed by members of the Jangmo-o evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** that is primarily used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) to create TMs. It cannot be used directly in battle or overworld traversal.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Standard material value; more commonly exchanged for League Points).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a recipe ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). When combined with League Points (LP) and other monster-specific materials, it allows the player to "print" move-teaching items.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle via Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly restricted to the preparation phase of competitive play, enabling the acquisition of high-value moves for a Pokémon's kit.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is intrinsically tied to the **Jangmo-o, Hakamo-o, and Kommo-o** line. In the context of *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, it is a necessary resource for moves often associated with Dragon-type or sound-based archetypes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Jangmo-o line. In the Paldea region's expanded areas (such as the land of Kitakami), these are farmed by encountering these Pokémon in the wild.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not a held item in the traditional sense, but a guaranteed drop from **Jangmo-o**, **Hakamo-o**, and **Kommo-o** upon their defeat in the field. Players often use "Sandwich Effects" (Encounter Power: Dragon) to mass-farm these scales for bulk TM production.
