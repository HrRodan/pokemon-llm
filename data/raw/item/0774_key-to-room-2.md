## Identity & Utility
**Key to Room 2** is a **Plot-Advancement Key Item** introduced in **Generation VI** (specifically within the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire titles, though indexed in Gen VII data).
* **Description:** A specific key required to navigate the wreckage of **Sea Mauville**. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon. It is a vital tool for environmental puzzle-solving rather than battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Unlocks the door to **Room 2** in the Sea Mauville facility. This allows the player to access internal chambers and advance the "Key Hunt" side-quest.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or any battle-related mechanics; it exists solely for overworld progression and narrative completion.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of a **sequential chain**. Finding the Key to Room 2 is required to eventually locate the Key to Room 4, and subsequently the Key to Room 6, ultimately leading to the discovery of the Scanner or various rare TMs and items (like the Beedrillite).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found within **Sea Mauville** in the Hoenn region. Typically, the player must explore Room 1 to find this key (often given by an NPC or found as a hidden object) to progress deeper into the ship's interior.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind quest item found only in its designated overworld location.
