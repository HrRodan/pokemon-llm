## Effect & Mechanics

* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held in battle and has no Fling utility).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely recreational item used for flavor and friendship-building in the overworld/camp UI. It holds no mechanical value in Smogon or VGC formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution directly, the friendship points gained from playing can help Pokémon that evolve via high friendship (e.g., Eevee into Sylveon/Espeon/Umbreon or Riolu into Lucario).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, the Yarn Ball is typically purchased from **Sure Cans** or **Ciclowd** branches across the Paldea region (e.g., in Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, or Levincia). 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not found** on wild Pokémon. It is a man-made recreational product intended for domestic Pokémon care and training. Unlike items found via the **Pickup** ability, this must be sourced through commerce or specific NPC interactions.
