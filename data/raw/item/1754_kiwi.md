## Identity & Utility
**Kiwi** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A sliced fruit ingredient used exclusively within the Picnic mechanic to craft sandwiches. It is a **Consumable** item that can be purchased in bulk for culinary crafting. As a raw ingredient, it has no direct utility in battle or the overworld outside of the sandwich mini-game.
* **Cost:** 180 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used as a sandwich topping, Kiwi contributes specific values to **Meal Powers**. In the Paldean culinary system, Kiwi is primarily associated with the **Dragon-type** and provides a balance of **Sweet and Sour** flavors. It is a key component for recipes aiming to increase:
    * **Catching Power:** (Specifically for Dragon-types).
    * **Raid Power:** (Specifically for Dragon-types).
    * **Exp. Point Power:** (Specifically for Dragon-types).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients generally cannot be used with the move Fling in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Non-Battle.** While it has zero utility in a standard VGC or Smogon match, it is "competitively viable" for **Shiny Hunters** and **Breeders** who use specific Kiwi-based recipes to trigger Sparkling Power or Egg Power.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts solely with the **Picnic** mechanic and is ignored by abilities like Pickup or Honey Gather.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at specialized grocery retailers across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Deli Cioso** outlets and the **Aquiesta Supermarket** in Levincia once the player has obtained a certain number of Gym Badges.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike Berries, which are foraged, Kiwi is treated as a processed commercial good within the Paldean economy.
