## Identity & Utility
**TM77** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A data disc used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. As an "all-machines" category item, its portability and utility depend on the specific generation: it transitioned from a single-use consumable (Gen 4) to an infinite-use tool (Gens 5-7), and back to a craftable/consumable resource (Gen 9).
* **Cost:** 1000 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Psych Up** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * *Move Description:* Psych Up is a Normal-type status move that resets the user's stat changes and copies the target's current stat stages (positive and negative).
    * *Note on Discrepancy:* While the item is traditionally associated with Psych Up, the provided flavor text from *Sword & Shield* describes the move **Hex** (which deals massive damage to targets with status conditions). This reflects the TM reshuffling in Generation VIII where TM77 taught Hex instead.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Psych Up:** Highly niche but potent in **VGC/Doubles**. It is used to copy an ally's massive stat boosts (e.g., from *Belly Drum* or *Weakness Policy*) or to nullify an opponent's *Calm Mind* or *Iron Defense* setup.
        * **Hex:** If teaching Hex (Gen 8 context), it is a staple for Ghost-type attackers on "status-spread" teams (e.g., paired with Will-O-Wisp or Toxic).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use (except in Generations V through VIII).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically available for purchase at major Department Stores (like Veilstone or Goldenrod) and the Battle Frontier. In *Scarlet & Violet (The Indigo Disk)*, it is craftable at the TM Machine using specific Pokémon materials.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is typically found as overworld loot in Poké Ball canisters or rewarded by NPCs.
* **Historical Context:** TM77 has been a mainstay in the series' data across 12 different version groups, making it one of the most consistently indexed TMs in the franchise.
