## Identity & Utility
**Ilima's Normalium Z** is a **Key Item** (categorized as "unused" in general item data due to its quest-specific nature) introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This is a specific, plot-relevant Z-Crystal entrusted to the player by the Trial Captain Ilima. Unlike standard Z-Crystals, this is a **Key Item** that cannot be held by Pokémon to trigger Z-Moves. It is used exclusively for a post-game or specific side-quest event in *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Unique plot item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The item serves as a quest objective. The player is tasked with returning this crystal to the pedestal at the back of **Verdant Cavern** on Melemele Island. Placing it triggers an encounter or completes a specific trial-related side quest involving Captain Ilima.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. This item exists solely for overworld progression and story completion. It does not provide the "Breakneck Blitz" Z-Move; that functionality is reserved for the standard Normalium Z.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve any Pokémon. It interacts specifically with the environment (the pedestal in Verdant Cavern).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained directly from **Captain Ilima** in Hau'oli City after certain conditions are met in the Alola region (specifically in the *Ultra* versions of the games).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon and cannot be obtained via the **Pickup** ability. It is a unique, one-of-a-kind artifact representing the traditions of the Alolan Island Challenge.
