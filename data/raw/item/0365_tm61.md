## Identity & Utility
**TM61** is a **Technical Machine** (Machine) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh Region).
* **Description:** This item is used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. In most iterations of the franchise, TM61 teaches **Will-O-Wisp**, a Fire-type status move. However, specifically in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, the TM contains **Guard Swap** (as reflected in the flavor text). It is a **consumable** teaching tool (single-use in Gen 4 and Gen 8/9; multi-use in Gen 5–7).
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive**). Its high price point typically reflects its status as a high-tier utility move found in late-game department stores or specialized shops.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a move to a compatible Pokémon.
    * **Will-O-Wisp (Standard):** Inflicts the **Burn** status condition on the target. This deals chip damage every turn and, crucially, **halves the target's Physical Attack stat**.
    * **Guard Swap (Sword/Shield):** The user employs psychic power to switch its current changes to Defense and Sp. Def stats with the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in most generations, or they have no base power/effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Will-O-Wisp:** A **Competitive Staple**. It is essential for defensive "walls" (e.g., Rotom-Wash, Dusclops, Arcanine) to shut down physical sweepers.
        * **Guard Swap:** Highly **Niche/Gimmick**. Occasionally used in Doubles to transfer defensive boosts from a "setup" Pokémon to a bulky partner.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Compatibility is determined by the Pokémon's move pool; most Fire, Ghost, and Psychic types are compatible with the respective moves.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** 
    * **Standard:** Usually purchasable at large-scale retailers like the **Veilstone Department Store**, **Lilycove Department Store**, or via **TM Machines** in the Paldea region (requiring LP and materials like Shuppet Scrap or Litwick Soot).
    * **Special Location:** Often found in "spooky" or graveyard-themed areas such as Mt. Pyre, Lost Tower, or Celestial Tower.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased, found as an overworld item, or received as a reward from NPCs. In newer generations, it can be crafted using the TM Machine.
