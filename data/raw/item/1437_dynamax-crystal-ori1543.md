## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (Ori1543)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized event item used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area (Galar). When used, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle encounter that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that cannot be bought through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal Value**; essentially not for sale as it is typically distributed via serial codes or special promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the empty Pokémon Den at the Watchtower Lair, the crystal is consumed to spawn a specific Pokémon (encoded as "Ori1543") for a Max Raid Battle. This allows players to access rare encounters, often featuring Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or those with Hidden Abilities, regardless of the current weather or natural den rotations.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** Its utility is strictly limited to the overworld for the purpose of catching Pokémon or farming Max Raid rewards (Exp. Candies, TRs, etc.).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It is a single-use trigger mechanism for the Dynamax/Gigantamax mechanic unique to the Galar region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** These crystals were primarily distributed as **Event Rewards** or **Pre-order Bonuses** (such as the dual-pack purchase bonus for Pokémon Sword and Shield). They are not available in Poké Marts or through natural gameplay.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is an artificial or "manufactured" item within the game’s lore, representing a concentrated shard of Dynamax energy used to attract specific powerful entities to the Watchtower Lair.
