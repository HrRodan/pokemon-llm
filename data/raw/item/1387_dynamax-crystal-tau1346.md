## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Tau1346** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This is a single-use consumable item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon will appear in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Special Acquisition; effectively priceless as it is distributed via serial code).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it emits a pillar of light that initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon. For **Tau1346**, this crystal specifically summons **Larvitar**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This item has no utility in competitive Pokémon battles; its value lies entirely in providing access to specific Pokémon encounters, often those that are version-exclusive or rare, allowing players to catch them with specific IVs or Hidden Abilities.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The encounter triggered by this crystal allows players to obtain a Pokémon early in the game that may otherwise be locked to late-game areas (e.g., Larvitar is typically found in the Lake of Outrage).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was primarily made available as a **pre-order bonus** or special distribution for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield* (specifically the Dual Pack). It is obtained by entering a unique serial code in the Mystery Gift menu.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a strictly digital distribution item. 
* **Lore Context:** Dynamax Crystals are rare fragments containing concentrated Galar particles. Unlike Wishing Pieces, which summon random encounters from the local den's pool, a "Tau" series crystal guarantees a specific, predetermined encounter regardless of the den's natural spawn table.
