## Identity & Utility
**Mega-Charm** is an **Unused Key Item** (categorized as a Key Stone variant) introduced in **Generation VII**.
* **Description:** This item is an aesthetic variant of the Key Stone. While its flavor text describes it as containing "untold power" to enable Mega Evolution, it serves as a specific asset for the female player character's Mega Evolution accessory (often seen in Pokémon Contests). It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Unique/Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** In terms of gameplay logic, it functions as a **Key Stone**. When a player possesses a Key Stone accessory and a Pokémon holds its corresponding Mega Stone, the "Mega Evolve" button becomes available in the battle menu. However, this specific iteration (Mega-Charm) is coded as an **unused asset** and is not obtainable through normal gameplay in the Gen VII titles.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be held or thrown in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** While Mega Evolution was a **central pillar** of the competitive meta in Generations VI and VII (VGC and Smogon), the "Mega-Charm" itself is a background item. The functional equivalent used by players is typically the Mega Ring, Mega Bracelet, or Z-Ring/Z-Power Ring.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts with any Pokémon capable of **Mega Evolution** (e.g., Charizard, Mewtwo, Lucario), provided they are holding their specific Mega Stone. It does not trigger permanent evolution but rather a temporary, mid-battle transformation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** **Unobtainable.** This item exists within the game data of *Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon* as a leftover or specific script-trigger for the female protagonist's model, but it is not added to the player's inventory through standard means.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is traditionally granted as a **plot-related gift** from a Key NPC (such as Professor Sycamore, Steven Stone, or Sina/Dexio).
* **Lore Context:** In the Hoenn region (ORAS), the Mega Charm is specifically the accessory worn by the female player character (May) on her wrist/hand. Its inclusion in Gen VII data represents the game's internal library of items required to support Mega Evolution mechanics and legacy character assets.
