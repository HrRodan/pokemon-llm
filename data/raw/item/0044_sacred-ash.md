## Identity & Utility
**Sacred Ash** is a high-tier **Revival Medicine** introduced in Generation II (with refined data tracking since Generation IV).
* **Description:** This legendary, ultra-rare powder possesses immense restorative properties. It is a **Consumable** item that functions as a "Full Team Reset," reviving every fainted Pokémon in the player's party and restoring them to 100% HP. While technically holdable, it must be used manually from the bag to trigger its primary effect.
* **Cost:** 50,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Special Acquisition**). Although it has a high price tag, it is rarely, if ever, found in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained through special events or legendary encounters.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, it revives **all** fainted Pokémon in the current party to full health. It is the most powerful revival item in the game, surpassing the Max Revive in scope.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None/Restricted.** In standard competitive formats (VGC, Smogon, Battle Tower/Subway), the use of items from the Bag is prohibited. As a held item, Sacred Ash provides no passive benefit, making it non-viable in a competitive meta.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. Its primary lore interaction is with the legendary Pokémon **Ho-Oh**, representing the bird's cycle of rebirth and its ability to grant life.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually limited to one or two per game. It is often found at the **Bell Tower (Tin Tower)** or given as a reward for high-level endgame challenges (e.g., Battle Frontier or Mount Battle). 
* **Wild Held Item:** Historically found held by wild **Ho-Oh** (100% encounter rate). Because Ho-Oh is a static legendary, this item cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or common wild encounters, making it one of the rarest "consumables" in the franchise.
* **Context:** In Nuzlocke challenges, the Sacred Ash is often banned or treated as a "Mercy" item due to its ability to undo a total party wipe (White Out).
