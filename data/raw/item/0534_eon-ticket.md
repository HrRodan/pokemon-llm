## Identity & Utility
**Eon Ticket** is an **Event-item (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation III** (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** A special ferry ticket required to board the S.S. Tidal and travel to the secluded **Southern Island**. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be sold, traded, or held by a Pokémon for use in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). This item is exclusively obtained through special distributions or events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When in the player's possession, it triggers a dialogue with the ferry captain (and potentially Norman in Petalburg City) to grant access to the Southern Island. Upon arrival, the player can encounter the legendary **Eon Pokémon**—either **Latias** or **Latios**—specifically the one that does not naturally roam the Hoenn region in that specific version of the game.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for world exploration and legendary acquisition; it provides no direct statistical benefit in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is required to encounter a Level 50 Latias (in Ruby/Omega Ruby) or Latios (in Sapphire/Alpha Sapphire) holding a **Soul Dew**. In the original Generation III games, it served as the only legitimate way to acquire the Soul Dew.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically distributed via the **Nintendo e-Reader** (Gen III) or via **StreetPass** (Generation VI / ORAS). It is never available for purchase in Poké Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is traditionally delivered to the player via a Deliveryman in a Pokémon Center or triggered by speaking to **Norman**, the Petalburg Gym Leader, after certain game conditions are met.
* **Lore context:** The flavor text implies a mystery surrounding Norman's knowledge of the ticket, positioning the item as a bridge between the mainland Hoenn region and the hidden nesting grounds of the Eon duo.
