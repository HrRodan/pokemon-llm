## Identity & Utility
**Power Weight** is an **Effort-training Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** A specialized weighted garment designed for Pokémon training. It is a **Holdable-Active** item that intentionally encumbers the holder to promote physical growth. While it significantly hinders performance during active combat, it is a foundational tool for trainers looking to optimize their Pokémon's durability.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Accessible**). In most core series games, this is a specialized item primarily purchased with Battle Points (BP) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Pokémon earns an additional **+4 HP Effort Values (EVs)** for every defeated opponent that awards experience. This bonus is applied *before* the doubling effect of **Pokérus**, potentially making training twice as efficient.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Moderate damage; no additional secondary effect).
    * **Speed Penalty:** The holder's **Speed is reduced by 50%** in battle. 
    * **Competitive Use:** It has **zero viability** in competitive VGC or Smogon formats due to the massive Speed penalty and lack of tactical advantage. It is strictly a **Preparation Staple** used by competitive players to "EV train" a Pokémon's HP stat before entering a tournament.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** 
    * **Breeding (World Knowledge):** Since Generation IV (specifically HeartGold/SoulSilver), if a Pokémon holds a Power Weight while in the Day Care or Nursery, it is guaranteed to pass down its **HP Individual Value (IV)** to its offspring.
    * **Abilities:** The Speed penalty is ignored if the Pokémon has the ability **Klutz**, but the Pokémon will also lose the EV-training benefits.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through **Battle Facilities** (Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, Battle Maison, or Battle Tree). It is rarely found in standard Poké Marts, representing its status as a professional trainer's tool. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is considered a man-made training tool.
* **Tiering:** It is part of the "Power Item" hexet (alongside the Power Bracer, Belt, Lens, Band, and Anklet), each corresponding to one of the six primary stats. The Power Weight is the specific tier for **HP optimization**.
