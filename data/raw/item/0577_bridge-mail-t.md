## Identity & Utility
**Bridge Mail T** is a **Mail** item introduced in **Generation V** (Unova Region).
* **Description:** A piece of stationery featuring an illustration of a high-tension steel suspension bridge (specifically themed after the Tubeline Bridge in Unova). It is a **Consumable/Held** item used to compose and send messages to other players during Pokémon trades. 
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** A Trainer can write a message using a predetermined list of words and give the Mail to a Pokémon to hold. The recipient can read the message and then either store it in their PC or erase it to make the item reusable.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Standard Mail typically has a Fling power of 10, but this specific data entry lists it as null/none).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Utility.** While primarily a social tool, Mail items have a unique mechanical property: a Pokémon holding Mail **cannot be placed in the PC**, and the item **cannot be removed or stolen** by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, or *Trick*. In certain historical competitive contexts, this was used to prevent item-swapping strategies, though it comes at the cost of not being able to hold a stat-boosting item.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts with the game's trading system and prevents the holder from being deposited into a PC box until the Mail is removed.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at Poké Marts in the Unova region, specifically in locations near the major bridges (such as the Village Bridge or Tubeline Bridge). In later generations, Mail items became increasingly rare or were removed from shops entirely as global communication features evolved.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a manufactured item intended for Trainer communication.
* **Lore context:** The "T" in Bridge Mail T stands for **Tubeline Bridge**, one of the iconic architectural landmarks of the Unova region, reflecting the Gen V focus on urban infrastructure and connectivity.
