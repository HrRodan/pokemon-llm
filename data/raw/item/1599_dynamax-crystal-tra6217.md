## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal TRA6217** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A consumable event-exclusive item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the **Watchtower Lair** in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Centiskorch**—appears as a raid boss until the end of the current day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Internal Value**). While it has a nominal price in the game's code, it is practically **Not for sale** and is obtained via serial codes or promotional events.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the empty Watchtower Lair (located in the North Lake Miloch area of the Wild Area), it generates a red beam that initiates a Max Raid Battle. This specific crystal (TRA6217) is coded to summon a **Gigantamax Centiskorch**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/External.** While the item itself has no battle utility, it provides a guaranteed encounter with a Pokémon possessing the **G-Max Factor**, which was historically relevant for VGC (Video Game Championships) before the introduction of Max Soup in the Isle of Armor DLC.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a "Spawn Trigger" for the Max Raid mechanic. It requires the player to have reached the Wild Area in *Pokémon Sword* or *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a promotional bonus. Specifically, **TRA6217** was often associated with retail-specific distributions (such as the Pokémon Pass app in the US or retail codes in Europe) to allow players early or guaranteed access to Gigantamax Centiskorch.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is an event-only delivery item that does not interact with the **Pickup** ability.
* **Lore context:** The "TRA" prefix stands for "Track," implying a tracked raid encounter. The Watchtower Lair is the only location in Galar capable of processing these high-energy crystals to manifest a Dynamax projection outside of standard den resets.
