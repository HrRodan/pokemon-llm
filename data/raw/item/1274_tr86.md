## Identity & Utility
**TR86 (Wild Charge)** is an **All-Machines (Technical Record)** item introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This item is a single-use Technical Record used to teach the move **Wild Charge**. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, TRs break after a single use, making them a consumable resource.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). While it has a high monetary value, it is most commonly traded for **Watts** (W) in the Wild Area rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a compatible Pokémon the move **Wild Charge**. 
    * **Move Profile:** Wild Charge is a Physical Electric-type move with 90 Power and 100% Accuracy. It deals recoil damage to the user equal to 1/4 of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 90. This is a high-damage value for the move Fling, making it a powerful one-time projectile if the user cannot naturally learn the move.
    * **Competitive Use:** **High/Staple.** Wild Charge is the primary physical Electric-type coverage move in the game. It is essential for physical attackers (such as Zacian, Arcanine, Luxray, and Electivire) who need to threaten Water and Flying-type opponents. 
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is single-use. Once the move is taught, the TR is consumed. It does not trigger any specific evolutions.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon Sword & Shield*, TR86 is primarily obtained by defeating Electric-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**. It can also be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area for a rotating price (typically 3,000–5,000 Watts).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is typically farmed through the Max Raid dens or acquired via the **Cram-o-matic** in the Isle of Armor expansion by combining specific items (often requiring Electric-type ingredients like Thunder Stones).
