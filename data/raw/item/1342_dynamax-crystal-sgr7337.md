## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR7337** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area. It is a single-use consumable that cannot be purchased through standard in-game marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Nominal/Placeholder cost; effectively **Not for sale** and distributed via external promotions).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When the player is at the **Watchtower Lair** (an otherwise inactive Pokémon Den in the Galar Wild Area), using this crystal causes a specific Dynamax or Gigantamax Pokémon to appear for a Raid Battle. Based on the "SGR" designation (often corresponding to internal Japanese naming or promotional codes), this specific crystal triggers a Max Raid Battle against **Gigantamax Sandaconda**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. This is a progression/event item. Its primary value is providing access to a Pokémon with the **Gigantamax Factor**, which was historically required for Sandaconda to use its signature G-Max Move, *G-Max Sandblast*, in competitive VGC or Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not evolve Pokémon. It serves as a "spawn trigger" for the Max Raid Battle system. The raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of limited-time retail or magazine promotions (such as those found in *CoroCoro* or through specific regional retailers like GameStop or GAME). It is not found through natural gameplay or the Pickup ability.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is classified as a "special acquisition" item meant to facilitate multiplayer raid encounters.
* **Lore context:** The "SGR" in the name is part of a series of alphanumeric codes (like *And15*, *SGR7337*) used to identify specific event-locked encounters in the Galar region's Wild Area.
