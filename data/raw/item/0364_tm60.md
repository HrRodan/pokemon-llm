## Identity & Utility
**TM60** is a Technical Machine (TM) introduced in **Generation IV** (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** It is a data-storage device used to teach a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. Unlike consumable medicines, TMs are instructional tools. In the context of the provided data, its function has shifted historically: it began as the source for **Drain Punch**, transitioned to **Quash**, and most recently taught **Power Swap** in the Galar region. 
* **Cost:** 30,000 Poké Dollars (Expensive). The high price indicates it is a late-game purchase usually found in major Department Stores rather than standard Marts.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. The move taught is generation-dependent:
    * **Gen IV:** Drain Punch (Fighting-type, HP-draining physical attack).
    * **Gen V–VII:** Quash (Dark-type, forces the target to move last in its priority bracket).
    * **Gen VIII (Sword/Shield):** Power Swap (Psychic-type, swaps the user's Attack/Special Attack stat stages with the target's).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Drain Punch (Historical):** A staple for bulky Fighting-types (e.g., Conkeldurr, Gallade) to provide offensive pressure and sustain.
        * **Quash (VGC/Doubles):** A high-level tactical move used to neutralize fast threats by forcing them to move last, often paired with a fast Prankster user.
        * **Power Swap:** A niche disruptive tool used to steal an opponent's setup boosts or to "offload" the user's stat drops (e.g., after using Draco Meteor).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in some generations (IV, VIII-IX) but was infinite-use in others (V–VII).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually purchased at large-scale retail hubs such as the **Veilstone Department Store** (Gen IV) or provided via specialized Move NPCs. The 30,000 cost reflects its status as a high-tier tactical upgrade.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon; as a manufactured machine, it must be found in the overworld or purchased from authorized vendors. It is not obtainable via the **Pickup** ability.
