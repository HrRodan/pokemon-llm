## Identity & Utility
**Iceroot Carrot** is a **Plot-Advancement (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword and Shield: The Crown Tundra DLC).
* **Description:** A specialized crop grown in frozen soil, specifically designed to attract the "King of Bountiful Harvests’" legendary steed. It is a **Key Item** that **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon in battle.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Iceroot Carrot serves as a summoning tool. When placed in the **Cradle of Destiny** at the **Crown Shrine**, it attracts the Legendary Pokémon **Glastrier**. This triggers the climactic encounter where Calyrex merges with Glastrier to become **Calyrex (Ice Rider)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be Flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for story progression and the acquisition of Legendary Pokémon. It does not provide any statistical or tactical advantage in competitive formats like VGC or Smogon.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Obtaining this item is mutually exclusive with the **Shaderoot Carrot**. Choosing to grow the Iceroot Carrot permanently locks the player into the Ice-type path for Calyrex's steed for that save file.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is obtained during the "The King of Bountiful Harvests" questline in the **Crown Tundra**. The player must obtain **Carrot Seeds** and choose to plant them in the icy soil of the **Snowslide Slope** field. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique, one-time quest item generated through the player's interaction with the environment and Calyrex's power.
* **Lore context:** The carrot is grown using the combined effort of the player's seeds and Calyrex’s "dance" to restore the land's fertility. Its icy properties are what specifically appeals to the gluttonous nature of the Ice-type steed, Glastrier.
