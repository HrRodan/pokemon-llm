## Identity & Utility
**Roto Stealth** is a **Rotom Power** (special consumable) introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** A specialized power-up granted by the Rotom Dex. It functions as a high-efficiency deterrent that prevents wild Pokémon encounters for a set duration. It is a **Consumable Overworld Item** that **cannot** be purchased in standard Poké Marts.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a gift-exclusive item obtained through gameplay mechanics.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When activated from the bag, it prevents the player from encountering wild Pokémon for a certain period of time. It acts as a specialized version of the "Repel" item family but does not depend on the level of the lead Pokémon in the party.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it has no Fling value).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is an overworld-only utility item. In the context of a "Nuzlocke" or speedrun, it is highly valuable for navigating dangerous tall grass or caves without depleting the team's HP or resources.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is part of the **Roto Loto** mechanic. It does not evolve any Pokémon and has no interaction with combat abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively available in **Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon**. It is acquired by participating in the **Roto Loto**, a minigame triggered by interacting with the Rotom Pokédex on the bottom screen of the Nintendo 3DS once its eyes flash gold. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is generated digitally by the Rotom Dex, reflecting the Alola region's unique technological integration with Pokémon spirits.
