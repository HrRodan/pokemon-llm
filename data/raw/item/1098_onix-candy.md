## Identity & Utility
**Onix Candy** is a **Species-Specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized nutritional supplement packed with energy. It is a **Consumable** medicine that can be used from the bag on specific Pokémon. While it has a technical internal cost, it is primarily an earned resource rather than a retail item.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal value**; typically sold rather than bought).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used on a member of the **Onix evolutionary line** (Onix or Steelix), it increases all six of the Pokémon's stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) by 1 point. This is achieved by increasing the Pokémon's **Awakening Values (AVs)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** This item is **Niche/System-Specific**. It is essential for maximizing a Pokémon's potential within the *Let's Go* series (especially for "Master Trainer" battles), but it has no effect and does not exist in the core series' EV/IV training systems (Gen VIII onwards).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item is restricted exclusively to **Onix** and its evolution, **Steelix**. It cannot be used on any other species.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available in standard Poké Marts. It is acquired primarily through the **Professor Oak Transfer** mechanic (sending caught Onix to the Professor) or by achieving high **Catch Combos** when hunting wild Onix in locations like Rock Tunnel or Victory Road.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is instead rewarded to the trainer for proficient catching or by walking with a Pokémon in the **Poké Ball Plus** peripheral.
