## Identity & Utility
**Luminous Moss** is a **Competitive Held Item** introduced in **Generation VI (Kalos)**.
* **Description:** An organic, light-emitting moss that reacts to moisture. It is a **consumable held item** that is used automatically in battle when the holder is struck by a specific move type. Once triggered, the item is consumed and removed from the holder for the duration of the battle (unless recovered via moves like *Recycle*).
* **Cost:** 4000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard**). While it can be purchased in certain late-game shops or Battle Facilities in various regions, its price reflects its specialized tactical nature.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** If the holder is hit by a **damaging Water-type move**, the Luminous Moss is consumed to raise the holder’s **Special Defense by one stage** (+1 SpD). 
    * *Note:* The boost occurs after the damage is dealt. It does not provide immunity to the Water-type move itself.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effect when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** This is a **niche tactical item**. In singles, it is rarely used because it requires a specific prediction. However, in **VGC/Doubles**, it is sometimes used in "Self-Proc" strategies, where a fast teammate hits an ally (often one with high HP but lower Sp. Def) with a weak Water move like *Water Shuriken* or *Surf* to instantly grant them a defensive boost and potentially activate other abilities (like *Weakness Policy* or *Stamina*).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger any evolutions. It is countered by the ability **Unnerve** (which prevents item consumption) and is ignored by Pokémon with the **Klutz** ability.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in coastal areas, caves with water features (like Reflection Cave in Kalos), or purchasable via BP (Battle Points) in post-game facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** It is famously associated with **Corsola**. In many regions, wild Corsola have a chance to be found carrying this item, making them the primary natural source for "farming" the moss.
* **World Knowledge:** The Luminous Moss is part of a duo of type-reactive consumable items introduced in Gen VI, the other being the **Snowball** (which raises Attack when hit by Ice moves). Both are designed to reward players for surviving specific elemental hits.
