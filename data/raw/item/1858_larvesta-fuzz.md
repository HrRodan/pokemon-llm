## Identity & Utility
**Larvesta Fuzz** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A clump of soft, flammable fuzz shed by Larvesta. It serves as a specialized crafting component used at the TM Machine found in Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible; primarily used for crafting rather than liquidity).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** This item functions as a "recipe ingredient" for the Technical Machine (TM) Machine. It is consumed alongside League Points (LP) to manufacture specific TMs containing moves associated with the Larvesta evolutionary line.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a material, it provides no tactical advantage in battle. Its value is purely "Meta-economical," allowing players to teach essential competitive moves like **Bug Buzz (TM162)** and **Flare Blitz (TM165)** to their team members.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource for the Generation IX move-learning mechanics.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained exclusively as a drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Larvesta line. 
* **Wild Source:** Dropped by wild **Larvesta** (commonly found in the Asado Desert) and **Volcarona** (found in Area Zero). Unlike traditional held items, this is a guaranteed or high-probability drop rewarded upon the conclusion of an encounter.
* **Context:** In the Paldean ecosystem, the fuzz is a byproduct of Larvesta's intense heat and growth. Trainers often farm this material in the desert regions to optimize the movepools of Fire and Bug-type special attackers.
