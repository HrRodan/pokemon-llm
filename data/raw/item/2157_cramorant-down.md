## Identity & Utility
**Cramorant Down** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A shed feather from the Gulp Pokémon, Cramorant. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. Unlike traditional held items or medicines, it serves as a currency-like ingredient for technical machine production.
* **Cost:** 30 Poké Dollars (**Very Cheap/Value for selling**). While it can be sold for a small amount of League Points (LP) or Poké Dollars, its primary value lies in its utility as a crafting component.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required ingredient for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs). In the Paldea and Kitakami regions, players exchange these materials along with League Points to create reusable moves for their Pokémon.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be flung in battle for damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item provides no tactical advantage in battle, cannot be held by a Pokémon for an effect, and cannot be used as a medicine. It is strictly a progression and customization item for the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any Pokémon evolutions and has no interaction with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a combat context.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the **Kitakami** region (The Teal Mask DLC). It is obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild Cramorant.
* **Wild Held Item:** While not "held" in the traditional sense, it is a guaranteed drop from wild **Cramorant**. It is most efficiently gathered by battling Cramorant near ponds and water sources in the Land of Kitakami or through the use of the **Let's Go!** auto-battle feature.
