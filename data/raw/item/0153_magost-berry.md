## Identity & Utility
**Magost Berry** is a **Baking-only Berry** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A rare, purple fruit known for its balanced flavor profile. Unlike medicinal berries, it is a **Consumable/Plantable** item used specifically for crafting **PokéBlocks** (Hoenn) and **Poffins** (Sinnoh). It has no direct overworld or battle-healing utility for the trainer.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a raw material in the creation of Contest snacks. In Generation III, it is blended into PokéBlocks to increase a Pokémon's **Cuteness** and **Toughness** stats. In Generation IV, it is cooked into Poffins for the same purpose. It provides no HP or status recovery when held.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Extremely low damage; no additional effect upon hit).
    * **Natural Gift (World Knowledge):** When used with the move Natural Gift, it becomes a **Rock-type** attack with **70 Base Power** (Gen IV-V) or **90 Base Power** (Gen VI+).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Negligible.** It is a "Contest Item" with zero viability in standard Smogon or VGC formats as it lacks a triggered held-item effect.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger any evolutions. It is primarily used to max out Contest conditions to earn Ribbons or qualify for high-rank Contest Spectaculars.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically acquired through berry masters (such as the Berry Master's wife in Hoenn by telling her specific phrases like "MAGICAL RECIPE") or found in the wild on various Berry Trees in the Sinnoh region.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not commonly held by wild Pokémon. Acquisition is almost entirely dependent on **cultivation** (planting in soft soil) or NPC gifts. In the Sinnoh region lore, it is a preferred ingredient for high-tier Poffins due to its unique sweetness and sourness.
