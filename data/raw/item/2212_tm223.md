## Identity & Utility
**TM223 (Metal Sound)** is an **All-Machines** item introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk)**.
* **Description:** A Technical Machine that teaches the move **Metal Sound** to compatible Pokémon. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TMs are single-use consumable data discs that can be crafted at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; requires crafting via the **TM Machine** or discovery in the Terarium).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Metal Sound**. This is a Steel-type Status move that emits a high-pitched, grinding noise to sharply lower the target's **Special Defense** stat (by 2 stages). It has an accuracy of 85%.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling in this generation).
    * **Competitive Use:** While niche in standard 6v6 or VGC due to its accuracy, TM223 is a **high-value utility item for Tera Raid Battles**. It is frequently used by support Pokémon to maximize the damage output of Special Attackers (like Gholdengo or Miraidon), enabling "One-Hit KO" (OHKO) strategies against Raid Bosses.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use but can be remade indefinitely if the player has the required materials.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Specifically associated with the **Blueberry Academy (The Indigo Disk)**. The recipe is typically unlocked after defeating a specific Trainer or finding the TM in the overworld of the **Terarium**. 
* **Crafting Requirements:** To replicate this TM, players generally require:
    * **LP** (League Points)
    * **Magnemite Screws**
    * **Shieldon Eyebrows** (or similar Steel-type Pokémon materials).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it must be crafted or found as a collectible item ball in the field.
