## Identity & Utility
**Jet Ball (lajet-ball)** is a **Poké Ball** introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus)**.
* **Description:** An advanced, high-performance Poké Ball engineered for long-range captures. It features a specialized aerodynamic design that allows it to be thrown in a fast, straight trajectory with minimal arc. It is a **Consumable Specialty Ball** used exclusively for catching Pokémon in the field.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). In its debut title, it is primarily obtained through crafting or specialized vendors rather than standard currency purchase in a traditional Poké Mart.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Jet Ball is the final tier of the Feather Ball and Wing Ball line. It has the fastest flight speed and the longest effective range of any Poké Ball. It provides a significant catch rate modifier when used against Pokémon that are flying high in the air or are located far from the player.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (The Fling mechanic does not exist in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, and the item cannot be transferred to games where Fling is present).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is exclusive to the Hisui region's unique overworld catching mechanics and is not used in VGC or Smogon formats, as it does not exist in the standard competitive item pool.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. Its performance is purely tied to the player’s aiming precision and the target's elevation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the **Hisui region**. Players can craft it using **1 Apricorn, 2 Sky Tumblestones, and 2 Iron Chunks**. The recipe is unlocked once the player reaches **Star Member Rank 8** in the Galaxy Expedition Team. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. In the context of Hisui, it is a human-crafted tool of the Survey Corps.
* **Context:** Within the lore of *Legends: Arceus*, the Jet Ball represents the pinnacle of ancient Poké Ball technology regarding aerodynamics, specifically designed to reach Pokémon that were previously considered "out of reach" by standard Feather or Wing Balls.
