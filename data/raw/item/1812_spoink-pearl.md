## Identity & Utility
**Spoink Pearl** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation 9** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** A crafting reagent dropped by members of the Spoink evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Material** used primarily at the TM Machine in Pokémon Centers. Unlike traditional held items, it is stored in the "TM Materials" pocket of the Bag and cannot be used directly in battle or on a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 140 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Reagent Value**). While it can be sold for a small amount of currency, it is more commonly exchanged for **League Points (LP)** or used as a component for move teaching.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient for crafting Technical Machines (TMs). Specifically, it is required to craft moves that align with Spoink’s Psychic-type nature or its pearl-bouncing theme.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** It has no utility in active combat. However, it is vital for the **metagame preparation phase**, as it is necessary to craft competitive TMs that allow Pokémon to learn specific coverage or utility moves.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Pokémon Materials" mechanic introduced in the Paldea region to facilitate the renewable acquisition of TMs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a reward for defeating or catching wild **Spoink** or **Grumpig**. It is a common drop found in areas where these Pokémon roam, such as the grassy biomes of the Paldea region.
* **Wild Drop:** Unlike traditional "Wild Held Items" from previous generations, this is a **guaranteed drop** upon the conclusion of a battle with a wild Spoink or Grumpig (including Tera Raid Battles). It is often gathered in bulk by players using the **"Let's Go!" Auto-Battle feature**.
