## Identity & Utility
**Power Belt** is an **Effort-training Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized training tool to be held by a Pokémon. It is a **Holdable Consumable-Alternative** (used for growth rather than immediate battle advantage) that can be purchased, though it is typically found in post-game battle facilities.
* **Cost:** 3000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Special Acquisition**). In most games, this "cost" translates to Battle Points (BP) rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, the Power Belt **reduces the holder's Speed stat by 50%**. In exchange, whenever the holder earns Defense Effort Values (EVs) from defeating a Pokémon, the Power Belt grants an **additional +4 Defense EVs**. This bonus is applied *before* the doubling effect of Pokérus, making it a cornerstone for efficient stat training.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 70 (Solid physical damage, but no secondary status effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Training Staple.** It is never used in actual competitive ladder matches (VGC/Smogon) because the Speed penalty is a massive liability. However, it is an **essential tool** for competitive players during the "breeding and training" phase to maximize a Pokémon's defensive bulk quickly.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is part of the "Power Item" series. It interacts negatively with the ability **Klutz** (which would negate the EV gain) and is unaffected by **Pickup**.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Usually unavailable in standard Poké Marts. It is typically acquired via **Battle Point (BP) Vendors** in locations like the Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, Battle Maison, or Battle Tree. 
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. It is a man-made training weight designed for rigorous conditioning.
* **Context:** The Power Belt is the Defense-specific counterpart to items like the *Power Bracer* (Attack) and *Power Lens* (Special Attack). In later generations (Gen VII onwards), the EV yield was buffed from +4 to +8, though it remains the primary method for "Power Training" defensive tanks.
