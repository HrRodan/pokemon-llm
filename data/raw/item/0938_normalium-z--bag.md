## Identity & Utility
**Normalium Z** is a **Z-Crystal** introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** This item represents the crystal stored within the player's Bag (specifically the Z-Crystal Case). It converts Z-Power into energy that upgrades a Pokémon's Normal-type moves into powerful Z-Moves. It is a **Key Item / Special Held Item** that **cannot** be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When held by a Pokémon that knows a Normal-type move, it allows the use of the Normal-type Z-Move: **Breakneck Blitz**. The power of the move scales based on the base move's power.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Z-Crystals cannot be used with Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** A **Competitive Staple** in the Generation VII meta. It is frequently used by wall-breakers to bypass defensive threats. It also provides unique secondary effects when paired with status moves (Z-Status); for example, **Z-Conversion** (Porygon-Z) boosts all stats by one stage, and **Z-Splash** (Magikarp/Mimikyu) boosts Attack by three stages.
    * **Mechanic Immunity:** Items like **Knock Off**, **Thief**, and **Covet** cannot remove or steal a Z-Crystal from a Pokémon in battle, and the ability **Sticky Hold** is redundant for this purpose.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. However, it is required for any Pokémon (most notably Silvally or Eevee-line) to access Normal-type burst damage in the Alola region.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This is typically the first Z-Crystal obtained by the player in the Alola region. It is awarded by **Trial Captain Ilima** after completing the trial at **Verdant Cavern** (Melemele Island).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique item tied to the "Island Challenge" rite of passage. In a gameplay context, once obtained, it is available infinitely for any number of compatible Pokémon in the party.
