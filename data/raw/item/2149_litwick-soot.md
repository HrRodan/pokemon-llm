## Identity & Utility
**Litwick Soot** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A fragment of soot shed by the Litwick evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** primarily used at the TM Machine to create Technical Machines. Unlike held items or medicine, it has no direct utility in battle or on the overworld outside of the crafting menu.
* **Cost:** 30 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Common Crafting Reagent**). While it can be sold for a small amount, its value lies in its use as currency for TM production.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient for crafting TMs at the TM Machine in Pokémon Scarlet & Violet. It is typically required for Ghost-type or Fire-type moves associated with the Litwick line's movepool (e.g., **TM092 Imprison**, **TM114 Shadow Ball**, or **TM198 Poltergeist**).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** As a crafting material, it does not impact competitive play (VGC/Smogon) directly. Its utility is strictly limited to the preparation phase of building a team (obtaining the necessary TMs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a resource gathered from the Litwick line and does not interact with abilities like Pickup or Klutz in a meaningful way.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a drop after defeating or catching members of the **Litwick line** (Litwick, Lampent, or Chandelure) in the wild. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not "held" in the traditional sense; it is a **guaranteed/random drop** upon the conclusion of an encounter. In the Paldea or Kitakami regions, trainers farm this material by locating Litwick outbreaks or encountering them in caves and ruins.
* **Lore Context:** The soot is a byproduct of the life-flecked flames that Litwick burns, symbolizing the eerie spectral energy the Pokémon radiates.
