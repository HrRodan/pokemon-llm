## Identity & Utility
**Full Heal** is a **Consumable Medicine (Status Cure)** introduced in Generation I (though indexed here in Generation III).
* **Description:** A versatile spray-type medicine designed for broad clinical application. It is a **consumable** item used to purge a Pokémon of debilitating conditions. It can be used both during battle and in the overworld. Unlike specific cures (e.g., Antidote, Parlyz Heal), it serves as a universal remedy for all major status conditions.
* **Cost:** 400 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**). It is significantly more cost-effective than buying individual status cures once player capital increases in the mid-game.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag, it immediately cures a single Pokémon of any primary status ailment (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep). Notably, it also cures the volatile status **Confusion**, making it more effective than a **Lum Berry** in certain scenarios (as Confusion does not always trigger a Berry immediately).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Provides no additional effect when thrown via Fling; purely deals minor damage).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None (Standard Play).** In official competitive formats (VGC, Smogon), trainers are prohibited from using items from the bag. In high-level play, the **Lum Berry** is the preferred held-item equivalent because it activates automatically without costing a turn.
    * **Nuzlocke/Playthrough Utility:** **High Tier.** It is a staple for mid-to-late game playthroughs and Nuzlocke challenges, saving inventory space and providing a "safety net" against RNG-heavy moves like Confuse Ray or Dynamic Punch.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It does not trigger evolution. It is a "Tier 2" status item—positioned above specific cures but below the **Full Restore**, which heals both status and HP simultaneously.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at most **Pokémon Marts** after the player has obtained a few Gym Badges. It is a standard stock item in all Department Stores (e.g., Celadon, Goldenrod, Lilycove).
* **Wild Held Item:** Not typically found on wild Pokémon. It is most commonly gathered by players through the **Pickup** ability at lower levels (Levels 11–30 depending on the game version) or found as a common overworld hidden item.
* **Context:** In the Pokémon world lore, the Full Heal represents an advancement in medical technology—combining the properties of various berries and specialized sprays into a single, high-pressure canister.
