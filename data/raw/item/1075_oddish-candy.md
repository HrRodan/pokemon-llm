## Identity & Utility
**Oddish Candy** is a **Species-specific Candy** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized consumable medicine packed with concentrated energy. Unlike standard Vitamins (like Protein) that boost a single stat, this candy is designed to increase all of a Pokémon's stats simultaneously. It is a **Consumable** item that can be sold for a small amount, though it is primarily acquired through gameplay rewards rather than traditional Mart purchases.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Specialized acquisition).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When fed to a Pokémon in the Oddish evolutionary line, it increases all stats—HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed—by 1 point. These points are applied as **Awakening Values (AVs)**, a mechanic exclusive to the *Let's Go* series that allows Pokémon to become significantly stronger than their base stats would suggest.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** Within the context of *Let's Go* competitive play, Species Candies are essential for "No Restrictions" formats. They allow an Oddish, Vileplume, or Bellossom to reach their maximum statistical potential. In standard competitive formats (VGC/Smogon) of later generations, this item does not exist, as the AV system was replaced by the traditional EV (Effort Value) system.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically targets **Oddish**, **Gloom**, **Vileplume**, and **Bellossom**. It does not trigger evolution but functions as a specialized "Super-Vitamin" for this specific family.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found exclusively in the Kanto region during the events of *Let's Go, Pikachu!/Eevee!*. It is obtained by catching large quantities of Oddish to build a **Catch Combo**, or by transferring Oddish to Professor Oak. It can also be rewarded for walking an Oddish in the **Poké Ball Plus**.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by wild Pokémon. It is traditionally gathered through the "Catching/Transferring" loop, rewarding trainers for focusing their research on the Oddish species.
