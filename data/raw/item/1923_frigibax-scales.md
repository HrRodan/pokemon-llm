## Identity & Utility
**Frigibax Scales** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** These are scales shed or harvested from the Frigibax evolutionary line. They serve as a specialized crafting ingredient used at the Technical Machine Machine (TM Machine) found at Pokémon Centers. It is a **Consumable Crafting Material** that can be sold for a small amount of currency but cannot be traditionally bought.
* **Cost:** 200 Poké Dollars (Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Used as a required component for crafting specific Technical Machines (TMs) in the Paldea region. When combined with League Points (LP) at a TM Machine, these scales allow the player to "print" moves. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** None. Its utility is strictly limited to the **overworld crafting economy**, facilitating move-pool customization for the player's team.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not trigger evolution, it is intrinsically linked to the **Frigibax, Arctibax, and Baxcalibur** line. It is specifically required to craft high-value TMs such as **TM115 (Dragon Pulse)** and **TM143 (Blizzard)** (Generation IX specific recipes).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Obtained as a loot drop after defeating or catching wild members of the Frigibax family.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held as a traditional item; instead, it is a guaranteed drop in the Paldea region.
    * **Primary Sources:** Found on wild **Frigibax**, **Arctibax**, and **Baxcalibur**, typically located in the high-altitude, snowy climates of **Glaseado Mountain**.
    * **Farming Context:** Players often farm these scales to teach Dragon and Ice-type coverage moves to their competitive roster during the post-game.
