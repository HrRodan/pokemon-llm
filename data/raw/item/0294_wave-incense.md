## Identity & Utility
**Wave Incense** is a **Type-Enhancement Held Item** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A fragrant incense with a "curious aroma" designed to be held by a Pokémon. It functions as a specialized offensive tool that amplifies elemental energy and acts as a biological catalyst for specific breeding patterns. It is a **Competitive Held Item** that is **Holdable** and **Active** during battle.
* **Cost:** 2000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Affordable**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** While held in battle, it increases the power of the holder’s **Water-type moves by 20%**. This effect is identical to the *Mystic Water* and the *Splash Plate*.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal damage; no additional secondary effects upon flinging).
    * **Competitive Use:** Generally considered a **Niche/Alternative** item. While the 20% boost is useful for Water-type attackers who want to avoid the recoil of a *Life Orb* or the move-locking of *Choice* items, it is often redundant if the player already possesses *Mystic Water*. It is primarily utilized in "Item Clause" formats (like VGC) where two Pokémon on the same team cannot hold the same item, allowing a second Water-type to benefit from a power boost.
* **Evolution/Interaction:**
    * **Breeding (Baby Trigger):** This is the essential catalyst for obtaining **Mantyke**. If a **Mantine** is left at the Pokémon Day Care or Nursery while holding this item, it will produce a Mantyke Egg. Without the incense, the Egg will hatch directly into a Mantine.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically found in specialized herb or incense shops (such as the market in Driftveil City or Hulbury). It is rarely found in standard Poké Marts. In its debut generation (Sinnoh), it was found as a field item on Route 210.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **not** found on wild Pokémon. It must be purchased from specialty vendors or found in the overworld. Because it is not held by wild species, it cannot be farmed using the **Pickup** ability or theft moves like **Thief/Covet**.
