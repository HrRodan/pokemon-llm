## Identity & Utility
**Wood Mail** is a **Mail Item** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**.
* **Description:** A stationary item featuring a decorative print of the Pokémon **Slakoth**. It is a **Consumable Social Item** that can be purchased at various Poké Marts. Once a message is written on it and given to a Pokémon, it becomes a held item intended for communication during trades.
* **Cost:** 50 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Allows a Trainer to compose a message from a predetermined list of words and phrases. This message is then attached to a Pokémon. When that Pokémon is traded, the recipient can read the message. The item can be reused if the message is erased, or the message can be archived in the Trainer's PC.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Mail items generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Obsolete.** While it provides no stat boosts, Mail items have a unique mechanical property: they **cannot be removed or stolen** by moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Covet*, or *Trick*. However, a Pokémon holding Mail cannot be deposited into the PC, making it impractical for standard competitive team management.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It acts as a "sticky" item that prevents the holder from being sent to the PC, effectively forcing the player to remove the item before organizing their boxes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold at **Poké Marts** in the Hoenn region (Generation III) and Kanto (FireRed/LeafGreen). In later generations, Mail items were gradually phased out and are now considered "Legacy" items that cannot be found in modern titles like Scarlet/Violet.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found on wild Pokémon. It is primarily obtained via purchase or by trading with NPCs who may have Pokémon holding various types of Mail.
* **Lore context:** The "Wood" designation refers to the forest-themed aesthetic, specifically highlighted by the **Slakoth** imagery, matching the lazy, forest-dwelling nature of the Pokémon featured on the stationary.
