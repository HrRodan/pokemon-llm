## Identity & Utility
**Dynite Ore** is a **Collectibles (Specialty Currency)** item introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** A mysterious ore found deep within the Max Lair of the Crown Tundra. It serves as a specialized exchange currency rather than a standard consumable or held item. While it can be sold at marts, its true value lies in trading with specific collectors for rare endgame resources.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Very low sell value; intended for trade-in utility rather than liquidation).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Functions as a **Unique Currency**. Players accumulate Dynite Ore by participating in and completing **Dynamax Adventures** in the Max Lair. It is traded to the Dynite Ore Merchant for high-tier competitive items, including:
    * **Ability Patches** (Changes a Pokémon to its Hidden Ability).
    * **Exp. Candies**, **Bottle Caps**, and **Mint Packs**.
    * **Competitive Held Items** (e.g., Weakness Policy, Life Orb).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects).
    * **Competitive Use:** While it has no utility *during* a battle, it is considered a **Mandatory Resource** for competitive players in Generation VIII to optimize Pokémon stats and abilities for VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** It is used to purchase **Max Honey** (required for G-Max Urshifu) and various evolution items from the merchant, making it a gateway to numerous evolutionary paths and form changes.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Exclusively obtained as a reward for completing **Dynamax Adventures**. The amount rewarded increases based on the number of Pokémon caught, if the player reaches the Legendary boss, and if they complete the run without any knockouts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. It is tied strictly to the Max Lair ecosystem.
* **Lore Context:** The ore is localized to the Crown Tundra region and appears to be a byproduct of the high concentrations of Dynamax energy found within the Max Lair, though its exact origin remains "mysterious" as per its flavor text.
