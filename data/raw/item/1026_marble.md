## Identity & Utility
**Marble** is a **Loot** item introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles).
* **Description:** A round glass marble containing internal colored glass patterns. It is a **Consumable Treasure** item that serves no functional purpose in battle or training; its primary design is to be sold to vendors.
* **Cost:** 300 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Value Item**). 

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** The Marble has no active effect on Pokémon. It is categorized as "Loot," meaning it is intended to be liquidated at Poké Marts for currency.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low-tier damage with no secondary effect).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item is purely for the in-game economy. It provides no stat boosts, recovery, or tactical utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual playthrough battles.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions and has no interactions with specific Pokémon species or abilities like Pickup or Klutz in its debut generation.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (Let's Go versions) as a hidden item. Players often find Marbles by interacting with background objects (like trash cans) or by observing their following Pokémon's reactions to hidden spots on the ground.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by any wild Pokémon. It is exclusively acquired through world exploration and environmental interaction.
