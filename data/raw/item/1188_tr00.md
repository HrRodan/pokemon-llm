## Identity & Utility
**TR00 (Technical Record 00)** is a **Technical Record (Consumable Machine)** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A specialized data recording used to teach the move **Swords Dance**. Unlike the permanent TMs (Technical Machines) found in the same region, TRs are single-use consumables that break after teaching the move to a compatible Pokémon. 
* **Cost:** 4,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate). In its debut region, it is more commonly traded for **Watts** (W) via Watt Traders rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Swords Dance**, a Normal-type status move. When used in battle, Swords Dance "sharply raises" the user's Attack stat by **two stages (+2)**, effectively doubling the Pokémon's physical damage output.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Very low; provides no secondary status effect when flung).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Swords Dance is one of the most important setup moves in competitive history (Smogon and VGC). It allows physical sweepers to bypass defensive walls and is a core component of "Setup Sweeper" archetypes.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is compatible with a vast array of Pokémon, ranging from physical attackers like Garchomp and Mimikyu to defensive utility Pokémon.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Galar region**. It can be purchased from **Watt Traders** in the Wild Area (stock rotates daily) or received as a reward for successfully completing **Max Raid Battles** against Normal-type or physical-attacker Pokémon.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not held by wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through trade, exploration, or raid participation, making it a resource that trainers often "farm" through the Max Raid Den system to ensure their competitive roster has access to optimal damage scaling.
