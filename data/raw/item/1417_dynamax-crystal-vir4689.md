## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (vir4689)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used within the Galar region's Wild Area. Specifically, it is used at the **Watchtower Lair** to force a Max Raid Battle to spawn. Once activated, the designated Pokémon remains available at the lair until the end of the day. It functions as a "Max Raid Trigger" for specific promotional encounters.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Special Acquisition**). While it has a nominal internal cost, this item is not sold in standard Poké Marts and is typically obtained through Mystery Gift serial codes or promotional distributions.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it summons a specific Dynamax Pokémon (the identity of which is determined by the specific crystal ID, in this case, a promotional encounter) for a Max Raid Battle.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for PvE (Player vs. Environment) content. Its value lies in providing access to specific Pokémon, potentially with Hidden Abilities, high individual values (IVs), or Gigantamax factors that could later be used in competitive play.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanic in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically distributed via **Serial Codes** as part of retail or magazine promotions (such as CoroCoro or retail pre-order bonuses). It is a one-time use item; once the raid is triggered, the crystal is consumed.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is strictly a promotional distribution item.
