## Identity & Utility
**Bronzor Fragment** is a **TM Material** introduced in **Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A physical material dropped by members of the Bronzor evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Crafting Resource** used primarily at the TM Machine to manufacture Technical Machines. It cannot be used directly in battle or held by a Pokémon for any tactical advantage.
* **Cost:** 80 Poké Dollars / League Points (**Cheap/Common**). While it cannot be bought, it can be sold or exchanged for League Points (LP).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as a specific ingredient in TM recipes. Players combine Bronzor Fragments with League Points (LP) and other materials to craft TMs such as **TM092 (Imprison)**, **TM104 (Iron Defense)**, and **TM121 (Heavy Slam)**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC, Smogon, or casual battle formats; its value is strictly limited to the out-of-battle crafting economy.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is stored in the "Materials" pocket of the bag and is not affected by abilities like Pickup or Klutz.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Not available for purchase at standard Poké Marts or Delibird Presents. It is acquired exclusively through overworld encounters.
* **Wild Held Item:** Dropped automatically after defeating or catching wild **Bronzor** or **Bronzong**. It is a common drop in the **Paldea** region, particularly in ruins or rocky areas where Bronzor congregate.
* **Lore Context:** The fragment represents a shard of the ancient, mechanical body of a Bronzor. Its metallic properties are utilized by the TM Machine's technology to encode specific steel-type or defensive moves into a usable disk.
