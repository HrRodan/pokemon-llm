## Identity & Utility
**Lettuce** is a **Sandwich Ingredient** introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** A fresh, leafy green used as a component for crafting sandwiches during Picnics. It is a consumable culinary ingredient that can be bought in bulk. Unlike traditional held items, it is stored in the "Ingredients" pocket of the Bag.
* **Cost:** 90 Poké Dollars (Very Cheap/Accessible).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used in a sandwich, Lettuce contributes to the calculation of **Meal Powers**. It is a primary ingredient for recipes targeting **Grass-type** Pokémon. Depending on the combination, it helps trigger:
    * **Encounter Power:** Grass
    * **Catching Power:** Grass
    * **Exp. Point Power:** Grass
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Ingredients cannot be held by Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats as it cannot be held in battle.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Lettuce does not trigger evolution. Its sole interaction is with the **Picnic mechanic** in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*, where it is placed manually onto bread to determine the sandwich's final buffs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Widely available at retail outlets across the Paldea region. It can be purchased at **Sure Cans**, **Deli Cioso**, and **Aguila Grocery** stores once the player has obtained a sufficient number of Gym Badges (though it is generally available very early in the game).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found held by wild Pokémon. It is sourced exclusively through human commerce and grocery vendors in urban hubs like Mesagoza, Cascarrafa, and Levincia.
