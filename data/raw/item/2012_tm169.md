## Identity & Utility
**TM169** is a **Machine** (Technical Machine) introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet)**.
* **Description:** This TM teaches the move **Draco Meteor**. It is a single-use teaching device in the Paldea region, though it can be reproduced using the TM Machine. It is a **Consumable** item used to permanently expand a Pokémon's move pool.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, it is obtained via crafting at the TM Machine or as a special reward.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Draco Meteor** to compatible Pokémon. Draco Meteor is a high-intensity Dragon-type Special move with **130 Base Power** and **90% Accuracy**. Its signature drawback is that it lowers the user's Special Attack by two stages (-2) immediately after use.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Draco Meteor is the definitive "Special Nuke" for Dragon-type Pokémon. It is widely used in both VGC and Smogon formats on powerful Special Attackers like **Miraidon**, **Walking Wake**, **Hydreigon**, and **Latios**. Its utility lies in its ability to secure OHKOs, often paired with a switch-out (Pivot) to reset the Special Attack drop.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. However, in previous generations, this move was exclusive to "Move Tutors" and restricted to high-friendship Dragon-types. Its transition to TM169 makes the move significantly more accessible to a wider variety of Pokémon, including those that become Dragon-type via Terastallization.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Craftable at the **TM Machine** in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. The recipe requires:
    * **14,000 LP** (League Points)
    * **3x Tatsugiri Scales**
    * **3x Goomy Mucus**
    * **3x Gible Scales**
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. The materials required to craft it must be farmed from wild **Tatsugiri**, **Goomy/Sliggoo/Goodra**, and **Gible/Gabite/Garchomp**.
* **Lore context:** Draco Meteor is lore-established as the ultimate Dragon-type move. Traditionally, it was only taught by a Move Tutor to trainers who had fully bonded with their Dragon Pokémon. Its inclusion as TM169 represents the technological advancement of the Paldean Pokémon League's training systems.
