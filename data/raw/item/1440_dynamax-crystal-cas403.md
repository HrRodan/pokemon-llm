## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CAS403** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** A special event-based consumable item used to trigger a Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears in a pillar of light, and the raid remains available until the end of the calendar day. It is a **Special Consumable** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (Technically cheap, but practically **Not for sale** as it is an event-exclusive item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it forces a specific Max Raid Battle to spawn. This allows the player to encounter a Pokémon that might otherwise be version-exclusive or rare. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no battle effect, it is used to farm high-IV Pokémon, specific Hidden Abilities, or Gigantamax-capable species essential for building VGC or Smogon competitive teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Interacts with the **Max Raid** mechanic. It does not trigger evolution but is the primary method for obtaining specific **Gigantamax** forms or rare species early in a playthrough.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item was distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** through promotional events (such as retail distributions or magazine tie-ins like *CoroCoro*). It is not available in Poké Marts or through natural exploration.
* **Wild Held Item:** None. This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it is strictly an event-tier distribution item.
* **Context:** In the hierarchy of Galar items, Dynamax Crystals serve as "on-demand" Raid Dens, bypassing the RNG usually associated with Wishing Pieces and Den resets.
