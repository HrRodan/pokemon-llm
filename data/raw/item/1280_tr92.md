## Identity & Utility
**TR92 (Dazzling Gleam)** is a **Consumable Machine** (Technical Record) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar).
*   **Description:** A single-use data disc used to teach a Pokémon a specific move. Unlike standard TMs in the Galar region, Technical Records (TRs) break after one use, functioning similarly to classic TMs from earlier generations. It teaches the move **Dazzling Gleam**, a powerful Fairy-type attack.
*   **Cost:** 6000 Poké Dollars (**Moderate/Standard**). In its debut region, it is frequently exchanged for **Watts** rather than standard currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
*   **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Dazzling Gleam** to compatible Pokémon. 
    *   **Move Profile:** Dazzling Gleam is a Fairy-type Special move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy.
    *   **Multi-Target:** In Double Battles, this move damages all adjacent opponents, making it highly valuable for spread damage.
*   **Battle Attributes:**
    *   **Fling Power:** 80 (High damage when used with the move Fling, though the item is consumed).
    *   **Competitive Use:** **High Viability.** Dazzling Gleam is the premier Fairy-type coverage move for many Special Attackers (Psychic, Ghost, and Electric types) that lack a natural Fairy-type STAB move. It is a staple in VGC (Doubles) due to its ability to bypass "Follow Me" by hitting both opponents simultaneously without triggering many contact-based abilities.
*   **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon successful use.

## Acquisition & Lore
*   **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the **Galar Wild Area**. It is sold by **Watt Traders** on a rotating daily inventory for 3,000 - 5,000 Watts or can be earned as a reward for defeating Fairy-type Pokémon in **Max Raid Battles**.
*   **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Acquisition is restricted to special vendors or Raid rewards, reflecting the Galar region's unique "Max Raid" economy.
*   **Lore Context:** TRs represent more "potent" or "rare" moves than standard TMs in the Sword & Shield era, often encompassing high-tier competitive attacks that require more effort to farm compared to permanent TMs.
