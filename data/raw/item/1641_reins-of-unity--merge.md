## Identity & Utility
**Reins-of-unity--merge** is a **Key Item** (classified as "unused" in general item indices but functional as a transformation tool) introduced in **Generation VIII** during the Crown Tundra expansion of the Galar region.
* **Description:** These are sacred reins crafted to restore the bond between the King of Bountiful Harvests and its loyal steed. It is a **Key Item** that cannot be consumed, sold, or held by a Pokémon in battle. It serves as the mechanical trigger for Pokémon fusion.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is a unique quest-related item.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the Bag, this item allows the player to fuse **Calyrex** with either **Glastrier** (to form Calyrex Ice Rider) or **Spectrier** (to form Calyrex Shadow Rider). The fusion process requires both Pokémon to be in the player's party and results in a single, powerful entity occupying one party slot.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the item itself is not a "held item" and does not occupy a slot in battle, it is **essential for competitive play** in Restricted formats (VGC) and Smogon Ubers. It is the only way to access Calyrex-Shadow and Calyrex-Ice, both of which are top-tier legendary threats due to their "As One" ability and high base stat totals.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item facilitates a reversible "fusion" mechanic. When used on a fused Calyrex, the Reins-of-Unity act as the "split" mechanism (often indexed as the `--separate` variant) to return Calyrex and its steed to their individual forms.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** The Reins of Unity are obtained strictly through the **Crown Tundra storyline**. The player must obtain a Radiant Flower and combine it with either a Shimmering Mane Hair (from Glastrier) or a Dark Mane Hair (from Spectrier) at the wooden pedestal in Freezington.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never found on wild Pokémon. It is a unique legendary artifact tied to the lore of the "King of Bountiful Harvests." It cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability or any other automated farming method.
