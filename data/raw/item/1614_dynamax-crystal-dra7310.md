## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (DRA7310)** is a specialized **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle. When used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it causes a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Duraludon**—to appear as a Raid Boss. It is a **Consumable Key-style item** that cannot be bought through traditional in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Nominal**; however, this item is typically obtained via serial codes or promotional distributions rather than currency).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon activation at the Watchtower Lair, the crystal emits a beam of light that initiates a Max Raid Battle with a specific Pokémon (Duraludon). This encounter remains active until the end of the day (midnight) or until the Pokémon is defeated/captured.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate rare encounters or acquire Pokémon with Hidden Abilities/High IVs for later competitive training.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use and is strictly tied to the **Max Raid Battle** mechanic unique to the Galar region's Wild Area.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Dynamax Crystals of this type were primarily distributed as **Pre-order Bonuses** (such as the Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield Dual Pack) or via special retail serial codes. They are not available through standard Mart inventory.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability; it is strictly an event-exclusive resource.
