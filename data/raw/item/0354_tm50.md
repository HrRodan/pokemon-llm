## Identity & Utility
**TM50** is a **Technical Machine (Machine)** introduced in **Generation III**.
* **Description:** A data disc used to teach a specific move to compatible Pokémon. Since Generation III, this TM has consistently taught the move **Overheat**. It is a **Consumable** item in older generations (one-time use) and became **Infinite Use** in Generation V, before reverting to a craftable consumable in Generation IX.
* **Cost:** 10,000 Poké Dollars (**Expensive/Standard** for high-tier TMs).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Overheat** to a compatible Pokémon. Overheat is a high-intensity Fire-type special attack with a Base Power of 130 (Gen IV–V) or 130 (Gen VI+). 
* **Move Drawback:** Upon successful use, the user’s Special Attack stat is lowered by two stages (-2 Sp. Atk), making it a high-risk, high-reward "nuke" move.
* **Legacy Note:** In Generation I, TM50 taught **Substitute**, and in Generation II, it taught **Nightmare**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Competitive Staple.** Overheat is a premier choice for Special Attackers and Fire-types (like Rotom-Heat, Overqwil, or Charizard). It is particularly effective on "Choice" item sets or "Pivot" builds where the user attacks and then immediately switches out to reset the Special Attack penalty.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Only usable on compatible Pokémon, primarily Fire-types or Pokémon capable of generating immense heat (e.g., Manectric, Luxray).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Historically, TM50 is the signature reward for defeating **Flannery**, the Lavaridge Town Gym Leader in the Hoenn region. In other regions, it is typically found in late-game areas, high-end Department Stores (like Lilycove or Celadon), or purchased via BP (Battle Points) in Battle Facilities.
* **Wild Held Item:** Never held by wild Pokémon; it must be obtained via Gym Leaders, overworld exploration, or specialized shops.
