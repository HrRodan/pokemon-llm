## Identity & Utility
**Powder Jar** is a gameplay-utility storage item introduced in **Generation III** (specifically featured in *Pokémon FireRed, LeafGreen,* and *Emerald*).
* **Description:** A specialized container used to store **Berry Powder**, a unique resource generated by the Berry Crusher mini-game. It functions as a "wallet" for a specific sub-currency rather than a consumable or held item. It is a **Key Item-style utility** that cannot be bought or sold.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**; acquired through NPC interaction).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Its sole purpose is to hold Berry Powder obtained through the **Berry Crusher** (a multiplayer communication feature using the Wireless Adapter or Link Cable). The jar can hold up to 99,999 units of powder.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used in battle; it resides in the Key Items or Berries pocket depending on the specific Gen III game version).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a purely administrative/resource management item for the overworld.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** While it does not evolve Pokémon directly, the Berry Powder it contains is exchanged with specific NPCs (such as the man in Cerulean City in *FireRed/LeafGreen* or the man in Slateport City in *Emerald*) for rare medicines, vitamins (for EV training), and herbal remedies.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In *Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen*, it is obtained from the **Berry Powder Man** in Cerulean City. In *Pokémon Emerald*, it is obtained from a similar NPC in the Slateport City Pokémon Center.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a unique gift item to facilitate multiplayer engagement.
* **Context:** The Powder Jar represents the "Berry Crushing" era of Pokémon, where players were encouraged to collaborate via the Game Boy Advance Wireless Adapter to grind berries into fine powder to trade for high-value items like **PP Up** or **Vitamins** (Protein, Iron, etc.), making it a grind-heavy precursor to modern item-exchange systems.
