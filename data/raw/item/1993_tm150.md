## Identity & Utility
**TM150 (Fire Blast)** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in the **Generation IX** DLC, *The Indigo Disk* (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** A move-teaching disc used to provide Pokémon with the powerful Fire-type move **Fire Blast**. In the context of Generation IX, this TM is a **consumable item** that can be crafted repeatedly once the recipe is unlocked.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired through exploration in the Terarium or by crafting at a Technical Machine Machine using League Points (LP) and specific Pokémon materials.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Fire Blast** to compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Stats:** Type: Fire | Category: Special | Power: 110 | Accuracy: 85% | PP: 5 (Max 8).
    * **Additional Effect:** Has a 10% chance to leave the target with a **Burn**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 10 (Minimal utility; TMs are generally not used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High-Tier Staple.** Fire Blast is a premier choice for Special Attackers (e.g., Chi-Yu, Iron Moth, Volcarona) who prioritize raw power over the consistency of Flamethrower. It is essential for securing OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) against bulky Steel, Grass, and Bug types in both VGC and Smogon formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use, but its data remains in the Technical Machine Machine for future crafting.

    * **12,000 LP**
    * **Magby Hair** (x5)
    * **Numel Lava** (x3)
    * **Torkoal Coal** (x3)
