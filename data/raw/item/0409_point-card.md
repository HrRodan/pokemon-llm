## Identity & Utility
**Point Card** is a **Gameplay Utility (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** A specialized tracking tool designed to record and display a Trainer's accumulated Battle Points (BP). It is a **Key Item** that functions as a digital wallet for non-standard currency. Because it is a essential progress item, it **cannot be bought, sold, or held** by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale/Key Item**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Serves as the official record for **Battle Points (BP)** earned through victories in battle facilities such as the Battle Tower, Battle Frontier, Battle Subway, or Battle Maison. It allows the player to check their current balance at any time from the Key Items pocket.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** While the card itself provides no tactical advantage in battle, it is the **backbone of competitive preparation**. It tracks the currency required to purchase high-tier competitive held items (e.g., Choice Specs, Life Orb, Focus Sash) and rare services (e.g., Ability Capsules or Move Tutors in specific generations).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** The Point Card does not trigger evolution. It is strictly a ledger for the "Exchange Service Corners" found within post-game battle hubs.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically gifted to the player by an NPC upon their first visit to a post-game battle facility (such as the Battle Zone in Sinnoh or the Battle Frontier in Johto). In later generations, this functionality was often integrated directly into the Trainer Card or VS Recorder, making the physical Point Card a signature element of the Gen IV and Gen VI eras.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon. It is a unique, player-bound item that cannot be traded or discarded.
