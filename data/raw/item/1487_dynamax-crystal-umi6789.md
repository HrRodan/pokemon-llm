## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal Umi6789** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** This is a specialized, consumable event item used specifically in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area, it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle that persists until midnight of the day it is activated. It is a **Consumable Encounter Item** that technically possesses a cost but is not available through standard retail means.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Technical Placeholder**; typically obtained via serial codes or special distributions rather than being bought).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it causes a specific, predetermined Pokémon to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day (00:00).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely for the "overworld" mechanic of initiating raids. It has no utility in VGC or Smogon formats, though the Pokémon caught from the resulting raid may have competitive value (e.g., Hidden Abilities or high IVs).
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not facilitate evolution. It interacts specifically with the **Watchtower Lair** environment in the Galar region. Unlike standard Wishing Pieces, which summon random raids at any den, this crystal is site-specific and encounter-specific.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily via **Serial Codes** as part of promotional events, pre-order bonuses, or retail collaborations (such as those with GameStop or Target).
* **Wild Held Item:** Never found on wild Pokémon. It is not part of the **Pickup** ability loot table.
* **Context:** The "Umi" series of crystals (like Umi6789) are often internal identifiers for specific distribution variants. These crystals allowed players early or exclusive access to Gigantamax-capable Pokémon or version-exclusive species (like Larvitar in *Sword* or Jangmo-o in *Shield*) before they were naturally accessible in the game's progression.
