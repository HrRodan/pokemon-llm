## Identity & Utility
**X Sp. Atk 2** is a **Miracle-Shooter** item introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** It is a specialized battle-only consumable that sharply raises the Special Attack stat of a Pokémon currently in battle. Unlike standard battle items, this variant is exclusive to the **Wonder Launcher** mechanic, a system that allowed item usage in competitive multiplayer matches during the Black and White era. It cannot be used from the bag in standard overworld play.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). It is acquired and used through the accumulation of points during a Wonder Launcher-enabled battle.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used, it raises the target Pokémon's **Special Attack by two stages** (+2). The effect is temporary and resets if the Pokémon is switched out or the battle ends.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and therefore cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Restricted.** This item was only relevant in Generation V competitive formats that specifically enabled the "Wonder Launcher" setting. In standard Smogon or VGC play, items cannot be used from the bag, making this item non-existent in those environments. Within its specific format, it served as a high-tier offensive booster for Special Sweepers.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger any evolutions. It is ignored by abilities like **Pickup** as it does not exist in the standard overworld item pool.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not found in Poké Marts or as hidden loot. It is strictly accessible via the **Wonder Launcher** menu during battles in *Pokémon Black, White, Black 2, and White 2*. Players must wait for their point gauge to fill to the required level to "purchase" the effect mid-turn.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not held by any wild Pokémon. It is a digital construct of the Unova region's advanced battle technology rather than a physical item found in nature.
