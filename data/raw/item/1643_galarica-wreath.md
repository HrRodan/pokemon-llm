## Identity & Utility
**Galarica Wreath** is an **Evolution Item** (categorized as a collectible) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield: The Crown Tundra).
* **Description:** A decorative crown meticulously woven from Galarica Twigs. It serves as the unique catalyst for the evolution of Galarian Slowpoke. It is a **Consumable Evolution Item** that is generally not purchased from standard Poké Marts, though it possesses a registered market value.
* **Cost:** 3,000 Poké Dollars (Moderate value; primarily acquired through crafting rather than direct purchase).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used from the bag on a **Galarian Slowpoke**, it triggers an immediate evolution into **Galarian Slowking**. Unlike the King's Rock (which evolves Kantonian Slowpoke via trade), this item is used directly like an Evolution Stone and does not require trading.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** 30 (Low damage; no additional secondary effects when thrown).
    * **Competitive Use:** The item itself has no competitive utility as a held item. However, it is essential for obtaining **Galarian Slowking**, a premier competitive threat in both VGC and Smogon formats known for its "Curious Medicine" or "Regenerator" abilities and its unique Poison/Psychic typing.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Specifically tied to the Galarian regional form. It is the "Crown Tundra" counterpart to the Galarica Cuff (found in the Isle of Armor), which evolves Galarian Slowpoke into Galarian Slowbro.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** In the Galar region, this item is crafted by an NPC located in the **Roaring-Sea Caves** of the Crown Tundra. The player must trade **15 Galarica Twigs** to have the wreath woven.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not naturally held by wild Pokémon. Players must scavenge for **Galarica Twigs** (often found as sparkling hidden items under trees in the Isle of Armor and Crown Tundra) to "buy" the crafting service for this item.
