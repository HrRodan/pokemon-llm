## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal SGR7264** is a **Dynamax Crystal** (Special Event Item) introduced in **Generation VIII** (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A rare, consumable event item used to trigger a specific Max Raid Battle at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area. Once activated, the designated Pokémon appears in the den until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Key Item** that cannot be bought in standard Poke Marts.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Symbolic/Minimal cost**; effectively not for sale as it is a distribution item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins of the Wild Area), it generates a red beam that initiates a Max Raid Battle against a specific Pokémon—in this case, **Gigantamax Corviknight**.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon and has no Fling value).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Utility Only.** While the item itself has no tactical use in battle, it was historically vital for competitive players to obtain a Corviknight with the **Gigantamax Factor**, allowing it to use *G-Max Wind Rage* in VGC and battle stadium formats where Gigantamaxing was permitted.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** environment. It does not evolve Pokémon or trigger abilities like Pickup. It is consumed upon the successful initiation of the raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific crystal was distributed as a **special promotional bonus** (typically via serial codes from retailers or pre-order bonuses for the *Sword & Shield* Expansion Pass). It is not available through natural gameplay or the Galar regional Marts.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is an "out-of-bag" trigger item meant to bypass the standard RNG of Raid Den spawns, guaranteeing a encounter with a rare Gigantamax form.
