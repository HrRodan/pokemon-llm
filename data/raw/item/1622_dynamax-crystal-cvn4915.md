## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal CVN4915** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar)**.
* **Description:** This is a special, consumable event item used specifically in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Galar region's Wild Area, it triggers a unique Max Raid Battle. It is a **Consumable Spawn Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Event Acquisition**; though a nominal cost exists in the data, it is effectively not for sale and was distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the Watchtower Lair (an empty den in the Watchtower Ruins), it causes a specific Pokémon—traditionally a Larvitar or Jangmo-o depending on the specific code/version—to appear as a Dynamax encounter. This raid remains active until the end of the day (midnight) in which the crystal was used.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This item exists solely to facilitate a single-player or co-op Max Raid Battle to catch a Pokémon that might otherwise be a version exclusive or rare spawn.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not evolve Pokémon. It functions as a key-item-style consumable that is removed from the inventory upon the successful activation of the Watchtower Lair raid.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Distributed primarily as a **Pre-order Bonus** or via **Retail Serial Codes** (such as those from Amazon, Target, or CoroCoro) for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*. This specific variant (CVN4915) is part of a series of crystals designed to give players early access to rare Pokémon like Larvitar or Jangmo-o.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on wild Pokémon. Unlike standard items, these cannot be farmed via the **Pickup** ability or by catching wild species; they are strictly limited-distribution items.
