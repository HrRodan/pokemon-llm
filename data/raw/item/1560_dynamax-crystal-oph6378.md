## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (oph6378)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar Region)**.
* **Description:** A rare, event-exclusive consumable item used in *Pokémon Sword & Shield*. When taken to the Watchtower Lair in the Wild Area, it triggers a specific Max Raid Battle that persists until the end of the day. It is a **Consumable Event Item** that cannot be purchased through standard gameplay.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Nominal/Not for sale**; this value represents a placeholder or minor sell-back price, as the item is distributed via serial codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Upon interaction with the **Watchtower Lair** (an empty den located in the Watchtower Ruins of the Galar Wild Area), the crystal is consumed to spawn a specific Max Raid Battle. 
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **None.** This is a utility item for the overworld used to facilitate rare encounters and has no application in VGC or Smogon competitive formats.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This specific crystal (oph6378) was a promotional item used to encounter **Gigantamax Centiskorch**. It bypasses the standard "Wishing Piece" mechanic to guarantee a specific rare spawn.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This item is not available in Poké Marts. It was distributed via **special serial codes** through retail partnerships (such as GAME in the UK or GameStop in the US) during promotional periods for *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.
* **Wild Held Item:** Not found on any wild Pokémon. It is an "Other Item" category object designed for event delivery rather than organic discovery or farming via the Pickup ability.
* **Location Context:** Its utility is strictly localized to the **Watchtower Ruins** in the Galar Wild Area. Once the crystal is activated, the red beam at the Watchtower Lair will remain active until the player defeats the Pokémon or the clock strikes midnight.
