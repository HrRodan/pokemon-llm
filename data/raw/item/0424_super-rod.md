## Identity & Utility
**Super-rod** is a **Gameplay (Key Item)** introduced in **Generation I** (represented in this dataset via its Generation III Hoenn iteration).
* **Description:** An awesome, high-tech fishing rod. It is the highest-tier fishing tool in the game's hierarchy (superior to the Old Rod and Good Rod). As a Key Item, it is a permanent tool used in the overworld and **cannot** be bought, sold, or held by a Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (Not for sale; Key Item).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used near a body of water, it initiates an encounter with wild aquatic Pokémon. It specifically pulls from the "Super Rod" encounter table of an area, which contains the highest-level and rarest Pokémon available in that location (e.g., Gyarados, Dratini, or Wailord).
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Key Items cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** N/A. Its utility is strictly for **overworld acquisition**. In Nuzlocke challenges, it is a critical tool for securing high-stat Water-type encounters in the late game.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not facilitate evolution. It is a fundamental tool for completing the Pokédex and building a diverse team during a playthrough.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Typically gifted to the player by an expert Fisherman NPC in the mid-to-late game. For example, in the Hoenn region (Gen III), it is famously obtained from a Fisherman in Mossdeep City. 
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is **never held** by wild Pokémon. It is a unique piece of equipment given to the trainer to signify their progression into advanced fishing areas. In world lore, it represents the "pinnacle" of angling technology, capable of hooking the strongest creatures of the deep.
