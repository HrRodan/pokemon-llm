## Identity & Utility
**Pinsir Candy** is a **Species-specific Stat Booster** introduced in **Generation VII** (specifically for *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!*).
* **Description:** A specialized, high-energy candy designed exclusively for the Pinsir evolutionary line. It is a **Consumable Medicine** that cannot be bought in standard Poke Marts; it is acquired through gameplay mechanics like catching or transferring Pokémon.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible** for selling, though its value lies in its usage rather than its resale price).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When consumed by a **Pinsir**, it grants a +1 bonus to every single stat (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed) simultaneously. This is used to raise "Awakening Values" (AVs), a stat-enhancement system unique to the *Let's Go* series.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held by a Pokémon in battle and thus cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/System-Specific.** While it is mandatory for optimizing Pinsir for the "Master Trainer" battles and "No Rules" link battles within the *Let's Go* ecosystem, it has no utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats, as the AV system and Species Candies do not exist in Generations VIII or IX.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is strictly for stat enhancement. It bypasses the limitations of size-based candies (like Quick Candy or Mighty Candy) by boosting all attributes at once without requiring the Pokémon to be at a specific level.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Primarily obtained in the Kanto region (LGPE) by catching wild Pinsir. Players receive these candies as rewards for **Catch Combos** or by "sending" caught Pinsir to **Professor Oak** (releasing them in exchange for specialized nourishment).
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; it is awarded directly to the trainer's inventory upon a successful capture or transfer. It is most efficiently farmed via a high Catch Combo in **Route 14** or **15** (Let's Go, Eevee!) or the **Cinnabar Lab** trade.
