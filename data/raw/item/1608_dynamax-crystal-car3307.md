## Identity & Utility
**Dynamax Crystal (car3307)** is a **Dynamax Crystal** introduced in **Generation VIII (Galar region)**.
* **Description:** A specialized, single-use consumable used at the Watchtower Lair in the Galar Wild Area. It functions as a beacon to force a specific Max Raid Battle encounter to spawn. It is a **Consumable Key-style Item** that is technically assigned a cost but is not available for purchase through standard in-game vendors.
* **Cost:** 20 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Symbolic**; primarily distributed via external promotional codes).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** When used at the stone pillar of the Watchtower Lair (located in the West Lake Axewell region of the Wild Area), it causes a specific Pokémon (in this case, typically a Gigantamax-capable species) to appear as a Max Raid Boss. The encounter remains active until the end of the day it was activated or until defeated.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (This item cannot be held or used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** **Niche/Indirect.** While the crystal itself has no utility in battle, it is used to guarantee encounters with Pokémon possessing rare Gigantamax factors or Hidden Abilities, which are essential for building competitive VGC and Smogon teams.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** Does not trigger evolution. It interacts exclusively with the **Watchtower Lair** mechanics in *Pokémon Sword* and *Pokémon Shield*.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** This specific variant of the Dynamax Crystal was distributed through **special events and retail promotions** (such as serial codes provided by retailers like GameStop, Target, or Pokémon Center distributions). Once the code is redeemed and the item used, the crystal is consumed.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon and cannot be gathered via the **Pickup** ability. It is an "event-only" logistical item designed to bridge real-world promotions with in-game encounters.
