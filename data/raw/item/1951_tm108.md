## Identity & Utility
**TM108** is a **Technical Machine (TM)** introduced in **Generation IX (Scarlet & Violet)**.
* **Description:** A single-use data disc that teaches a Pokémon a specific move. In the Paldea and Blueberry Academy regions, TM108 contains the move **Crunch**. It is a **Consumable** machine that follows the crafting mechanics of the modern Pokémon era.
* **Cost:** 0 Poké Dollars (**Not for sale**). In *Scarlet & Violet*, this item is acquired through exploration or synthesized at a TM Machine using League Points (LP) and Pokémon materials rather than purchased with currency.

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches the move **Crunch** to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Move Profile:** A Physical Dark-type move with 80 Base Power and 100% Accuracy. 
    * **Secondary Effect:** Has a 20% chance to lower the target's Defense stat by one stage.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (TMs cannot be used with the move Fling in current generations).
    * **Competitive Use:** **High Utility/Staple.** Crunch is the gold standard for reliable Physical Dark-type damage. It is frequently seen on Physical attackers like **Tyranitar**, **Roaring Moon**, and **Mabosstiff**. The Defense drop chance makes it dangerous for defensive switch-ins, providing excellent neutral coverage against Psychic and Ghost types.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. It is consumed upon use in Generation IX, though the move can be "remembered" via the Move Reminder once learned.

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Found as a collectible item in the overworld (notably in the **North Province** of Paldea) or rewarded for defeating specific trainers. 
* **Crafting Recipe:** In the *Scarlet & Violet* TM Machine, it requires:
    * **8,000 LP**
    * **5× Maschiff Fang**
    * **3× Yungoos Fur**
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is never held by wild Pokémon; however, the materials required to craft it are gathered by defeating or catching wild **Maschiff**, **Mabosstiff**, **Yungoos**, and **Gumshoos**.
