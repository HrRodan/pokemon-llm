## Identity & Utility
**TM21** is a Technical Machine (TM) categorized under **All-Machines**, originally introduced in Generation I, with its specific identity evolving across different regional iterations.
* **Description:** A data-encoding disc used to teach a move to a compatible Pokémon. Historically, it is most famous for teaching **Frustration**, a move whose power increases as the user's friendship decreases. However, in specific iterations (like *Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee*), it teaches **Foul Play**, which uses the target's Attack stat against them. It is a **Consumable/Reusable** machine (depending on the specific game's mechanics) that **can** be bought.
* **Cost:** 1,000 Poké Dollars (**Cheap/Accessible**).

## Effect & Mechanics
* **Primary Effect:** Teaches a specific move to a compatible Pokémon. 
    * **Frustration (Standard):** Deals physical Normal-type damage. Power ranges from 1 to 102, scaling inversely with the user's Friendship (lower Friendship = higher Power).
    * **Foul Play (Let's Go):** Deals physical Dark-type damage. Calculation uses the target's Attack stat instead of the user's, making it a powerful counter against physical sweepers.
    * **Mega Drain (Gen I):** Restores HP to the user equal to half the damage dealt.
* **Battle Attributes:**
    * **Fling Power:** N/A (Technical Machines generally cannot be used with the move Fling).
    * **Competitive Use:** 
        * **Frustration:** Historically a **Competitive Staple** for physical attackers in Generations II through VII. It was often preferred over "Return" to prevent *Ditto* from dealing maximum damage if the opponent hadn't adjusted the Ditto's friendship.
        * **Foul Play:** A **Top-Tier Utility Move** in VGC and Smogon for defensive or support Pokémon (e.g., Mandibuzz, Umbreon, Klefki) to punish high-Attack opponents without requiring offensive investment from the user.
* **Evolution/Interaction:** This item does not trigger evolution. Move compatibility is extremely high; almost every Pokémon that can learn TMs could learn Frustration (Gen II-VII).

## Acquisition & Lore
* **Availability:** Commonly sold in major Department Stores (such as Celadon, Goldenrod, or Lilycove) or awarded by NPCs who evaluate the "unhappiness" or "bond" of your Pokémon. In Hoenn (Gen III), it is specifically gifted by a man in Pacifidlog Town if the lead Pokémon's friendship is low.
* **Wild Held Item:** This item is not found held by wild Pokémon. It must be acquired through shops, overworld pick-ups, or NPC interaction.
