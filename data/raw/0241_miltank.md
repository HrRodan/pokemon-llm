## Identity & Lore
Miltank (Pokedex #241) is the Milk Cow Pokémon, a pink, bipedal bovine commonly found grazing in the grasslands of the **Generation II (Johto)** region. Famed for its ability to produce highly nutritional milk, Miltank is a symbol of healing and sustenance; its milk is widely used to restore the vitality of sick humans and Pokémon alike. It shares a biological counterpart relationship with the pure-male species, **Tauros**. While it appears docile, Miltank is surprisingly agile and can curl its body into a ball to execute high-speed rolling attacks. In Pokémon lore, it is infamously associated with the Goldenrod City Gym Leader, Whitney, whose Miltank is known for overwhelming challengers with its **Rollout** technique.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 80, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 70, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Tank / Utility Cleric.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a natural **immunity to Ghost**. While it has no natural resistances, its abilities can provide artificial resistances or immunities.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Defense, Speed, and Utility pool (while ignoring its poor Special Attack), key moves include **Body Slam** (for STAB and paralysis), **Milk Drink** (reliable instant recovery), **Heal Bell** (to cure team status conditions), and **Earthquake** (for coverage against Rock and Steel types). Alternatively, **Body Press** utilizes its high Defense stat for damage calculation.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Thick Fat:** Grants resistance to Fire and Ice-type moves, effectively giving Miltank two extra resistances.
    *   **Scrappy:** Allows Normal and Fighting-type moves to hit Ghost-type Pokémon, ensuring attacks like Body Slam cannot be blocked by immunity.
    *   **Sap Sipper (Hidden):** Absorbs Grass-type moves to boost Attack, granting an immunity to Leech Seed and Spore.

## Evolution & Biology
Miltank is a stand-alone Pokémon that does not evolve from or into any other species. It is part of a single-stage line but is biologically linked to **Tauros**; Miltank is an exclusively female species (100% Female), while Tauros is exclusively male. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and requires approximately 5,120 steps (Cycle 20) to hatch.
