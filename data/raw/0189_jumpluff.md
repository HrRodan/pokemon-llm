## Identity & Lore
Jumpluff (Pokédex #189) is the Cottonweed Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its spherical blue body and three cotton-puff spores, this Grass/Flying-type is strictly dependent on wind currents for locomotion. According to its biology, once Jumpluff catches a wind, it can deftly control its spores to float across the globe, crossing entire oceans to spread its offspring. It inhabits grasslands and temperate climates, though its migratory nature disperses it widely. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the final stage of a common early-route evolutionary line in the Johto region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 55, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 95, Speed 110.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility / Disrupter.
*   **Type Matchups:** Jumpluff suffers from a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice-type** attacks. It is also **weak to Fire, Poison, Flying, and Rock**. However, it is **immune to Ground-type** moves (due to its Flying type) and **resists Fighting, Water, and Grass**.
*   **Move Selection:** Because its offensive stats are poor, Jumpluff relies on its high Speed (110) to disrupt opponents before they can act. An optimal set includes **Sleep Powder** (to incapacitate threats), **Tailwind** (to double team speed), **Encore** (to lock enemies into useless moves), and **U-turn** (to pivot out to a teammate safely).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Chlorophyll:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during harsh sunlight, making it one of the fastest Pokémon in the game under these conditions.
    *   **Leaf Guard:** Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by status conditions during harsh sunlight.
    *   **Infiltrator (Hidden Ability):** Allows the Pokémon's moves to ignore the enemy's Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, Mist, and Substitute.

## Evolution & Biology
Jumpluff is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Skiploom** starting at **Level 27**, which itself evolves from **Hoppip** starting at **Level 18**. While the pre-evolutions are lighter and more susceptible to being blown away uncontrollably, Jumpluff gains the agency to maneuver through the air. It belongs to the **Fairy** and **Plant** Egg Groups and has a medium-slow growth rate.
