## Identity & Lore
Shellder (Pokedex #090) is the Bivalve Pokémon, a sturdy aquatic creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its incredibly durable, purple shell, this Pokémon resides primarily in the sea, capable of repelling almost any kind of attack. It remains protected within its casing, becoming vulnerable only when it opens its valves to extend its tongue. While Shellder does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it holds a unique place in Pokémon ecology as a biological catalyst: its bite is the specific trigger required for a Slowpoke to evolve into a Slowbro (if bitten on the tail) or Slowking (if bitten on the head).

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Shell Armor:** Prevents the Pokémon from receiving a critical hit.
    *   **Skill Link:** The tactical centerpiece of Shellder's kit; this guarantees that multi-hit moves (like Icicle Spear and Rock Blast) always hit the maximum of 5 times.

## Evolution & Biology
