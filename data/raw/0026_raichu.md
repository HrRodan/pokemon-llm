## Identity & Lore
Raichu (Pokedex #026) is the fully evolved Electric-type Mouse Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its orange-yellow fur, dark ear tips, and a long, thin tail ending in a lightning-bolt shape, Raichu is capable of storing over 100,000 volts of electricity. It inhabits forests where it frequently plants its tail into the earth to discharge excess energy; this tail serves as a vital grounding wire to protect the Pokémon from electrocuting itself. While the standard form is pure Electric-type, Raichu possesses a regional variant known as **Alolan Raichu**, which is dual-type Electric/Psychic and floats on its tail using telekinesis.

## Evolution & Biology
Raichu is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pikachu** when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. The line begins with the baby Pokémon **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship**. Raichu belongs to the **Ground** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. Unlike its pre-evolution, Pikachu, Raichu cannot Gigantamax.
