## Identity & Lore
Tentacruel (Pokedex #073) is the Jellyfish Pokémon first discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Often feared by sailors and swimmers as the "Gangster of the Sea," this aggressive predator possesses 80 tentacles which are normally kept short but can be extended to ensnare and immobilize prey with toxic poison. Its body is primarily blue and gelatinous, allowing it to camouflage effectively in the open sea. While Tentacruel does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is biologically distinct from the convergent species Toedscruel found in the Paldea region, which resembles it in appearance but differs in typing and habitat.

## Evolution & Biology
Tentacruel is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Tentacool** starting at **Level 30**. In the wild, it may occasionally be found holding a Poison Barb. It belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group. Biologically, its multiple appendages serve as both a propulsion system and a weapon, capable of absorbing water to stretch and constrict enemies.
