## Identity & Lore
Bayleef (Pokédex #153) is the Leaf Pokémon, a pure Grass-type entity introduced in Generation II (Johto). Resembling a pale yellow sauropod, this quadrupedal Pokémon is distinguished by the ring of curled leaves encircling its long neck and a single large leaf atop its head. Biologically, the leaves around its neck contain small tree shoots inside that secrete a unique aroma. Unlike the soothing scent of its pre-evolution, Bayleef's spicy fragrance acts as a stimulant; sniffing it invigorates nearby organisms and instigates a strong desire to fight. It is primarily found in grassland habitats and serves as the intermediate stage for the Johto region's Grass starter.

## Evolution & Biology
Bayleef is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line within the Monster and Plant Egg Groups. It evolves from **Chikorita** starting at **Level 16**. Upon reaching **Level 32**, Bayleef evolves into the final form, **Meganium**. The distinct aroma produced by its neck leaves shifts from sweet (Chikorita) to spicy (Bayleef), before returning to a calming, soothing scent upon evolving into Meganium.
