## Identity & Lore
Igglybuff (Pokedex #174) is the Balloon Pokémon, a small, pink, orb-like creature introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Defined by its incredibly soft and pliable body, Igglybuff has a rubbery texture that allows it to bounce continuously; once it begins to roll, it is often impossible to stop due to its momentum. Unlike its evolved forms, Igglybuff’s vocal cords are not fully developed, causing it to suffer from a sore throat if it attempts to sing for too long, necessitating that it gargles with freshwater from clean streams. While Igglybuff itself does not possess alternate forms, its evolutionary line is significant for including the ancient Paradox Pokémon **Scream Tail** (an ancestor of Jigglypuff found in Paldea).

## Evolution & Biology
Igglybuff is the initial stage of a three-stage evolutionary line and is classified as a **Baby Pokémon**. It evolves into **Jigglypuff** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (220 or higher). Subsequently, Jigglypuff evolves into **Wigglytuff** when exposed to a **Moon Stone**. As a Baby Pokémon, Igglybuff belongs to the **No Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group and cannot breed; to obtain an Egg containing Igglybuff, a female Jigglypuff or Wigglytuff is typically required.
