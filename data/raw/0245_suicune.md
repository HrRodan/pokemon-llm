## Identity & Lore
Suicune (Pokedex #245) is the Legendary **Aurora Pokémon**, a graceful Water-type entity introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Resembling a majestic, blue quadrupedal beast with diamond-shaped spots and a flowing purple mane that evokes the image of an aurora, Suicune is said to be the embodiment of the north wind. According to myth, it races across the world to purify fouled and murky water upon contact. It is a member of the **Legendary Beasts** trio, alongside Raikou and Entei, and is closely associated with the Mythical Pokémon Ho-Oh. While Suicune does not evolve or possess a Mega Evolution, it has a prehistoric Paradox form known as **Walking Wake**, introduced in the Paldea region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 75, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 115, Speed 85.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Setup Sweeper / Defensive Tank. With massive 115 base stats in both Defense and Special Defense coupled with a solid HP pool, Suicune excels at attrition warfare.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks, allowing it to easily switch into common offensive threats.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its defensive bulk and higher Special Attack, key moves include **Scald** (for STAB and burn utility), **Calm Mind** (to boost offensive and special defensive presence), **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Grass and Dragon types), and **Rest** (for full recovery).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** When hit by a move, the attacker uses 2 PP instead of 1. This reinforces Suicune's role as a stall tank, draining opponent resources.
    *   **Inner Focus (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from flinching, providing reliability against moves like Fake Out.

## Evolution & Biology
Suicune is a **non-evolving** Legendary Pokémon. It is not part of any evolutionary chain and belongs to the **No Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Lore dictates that Suicune was created by Ho-Oh within the Burned Tower of Ecruteak City; it represents the rain that quenched the flames which destroyed the tower, while its counterparts Raikou and Entei represent the lightning that struck it and the fire that consumed it, respectively.
