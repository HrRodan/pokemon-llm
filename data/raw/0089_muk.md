## Identity & Lore
Muk (Pokedex #089) is the Sludge Pokémon, a bio-hazardous entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This amorphous creature is composed entirely of living, purple toxic waste, often thriving in dirty, urban environments where pollution is abundant. Its body is coated in a vile sludge so toxic that even its footprints contain lethal poison, instantly killing plant life upon contact. While this profile details the pure Poison-type Kantonian form, Muk possesses a distinct regional variant, **Alolan Muk**, which gains the Dark typing and a multicolored appearance due to consuming specific types of garbage.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 105, Attack 105, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 100, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Tank / Special Sponge.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Poison-type, Muk is **weak to Ground and Psychic** moves. It notably **resists Fighting, Poison, Bug, Grass, and Fairy** types, making it an excellent counter to Fairy-type attackers.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and bulk, Muk's optimal moveset includes **Gunk Shot** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage and **Drain Punch** for coverage and health recovery. **Ice Punch** is essential for dealing with Ground-type threats, while **Minimize** (or **Curse**) allows it to become an elusive or durable setup threat.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Stench:** Grants a slight chance to make the opponent flinch when attacking.
    *   **Sticky Hold:** Prevents the Pokémon from having its held item stolen by moves like Knock Off or Thief.
    *   **Poison Touch (Hidden Ability):** Physical contact with this Pokémon has a 30% chance of poisoning the attacker, punishing opponents who use contact moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Muk is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Grimer** starting at **Level 38**. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group and is typically found in areas of high industrial waste. Its high capture rate and urban habitat make it a symbol of environmental pollution in the Pokémon world.
