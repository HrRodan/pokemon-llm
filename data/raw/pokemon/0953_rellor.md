## Identity & Lore
Rellor (#953) is the Rolling Pokémon, a diminutive Bug-type species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This industrious creature is easily identified by the massive ball of mud it perpetually rolls, which it creates by binding sand and dirt together with its latent psychic energy. Rellor is known to be obsessively protective of its sphere, valuing the mud ball more than its own life. While Rellor itself is a pure Bug-type, its reliance on psychic energy to maintain its ball foreshadows its eventual transformation. Though Rellor does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its evolution, Rabsca, is highly regarded for its unique "Revival Blessing" capabilities in competitive play. It is typically found in arid, sandy environments where it can easily gather materials for its precious cargo.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 41, Attack 50, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 31, Sp. Def 58, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Low-Speed Physical Tank/Utility. Due to its low base stat total, Rellor functions primarily as an early-game physical sponge or a utility setter before evolving.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Bug-type, it is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Fire**. It provides notable **resistances to Fighting, Ground, and Grass-type attacks**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its higher physical Attack and its signature rolling theme, effective moves include **Lunge** (which lowers the opponent's Attack), **X-Scissor** (its primary STAB physical move), **Dig** (for Ground-type coverage), and **Recover** (to capitalize on its decent defensive investment).
* **Abilities:** **Compound-Eyes** (increases the accuracy of its moves, making it more reliable with low-accuracy attacks like Gunk Shot) and its hidden ability **Shed Skin** (provides a 33% chance to heal status conditions like paralysis or burn at the end of each turn).

## Evolution & Biology
Rellor is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Rabsca**, a Bug/Psychic-type, through a unique Paldean method: it must be walked alongside its trainer for 1,000 steps using the **"Let's Go" feature** before being leveled up. Biologically, Rellor belongs to the **Bug Egg Group** and has a fast growth rate, allowing it to reach its evolution requirements quickly. Despite its small size of 0.2 meters, its physical strength is significant enough to move mud balls many times its own weight. Researchers note that the mud ball serves as a vessel for the psychic power that eventually matures and takes over the Pokémon's form upon evolution.
