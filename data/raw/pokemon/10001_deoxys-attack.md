## Identity & Lore
Deoxys-Attack (Pokedex #10001) is the Attack Form of the DNA Pokémon, a Mythical entity that originated from an extraterrestrial virus. Initially traveling through space on a meteor, the virus underwent a radical mutation when exposed to a terrestrial laser beam, resulting in the crystalline organ on its chest which serves as its brain. This specific form represents Deoxys in its most aggressive state, with its cellular structure reconfigured to maximize offensive output at the total expense of durability. First discovered in the Hoenn region during Generation III, Deoxys is unique for its ability to shift between four distinct forms: Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its sheer power in this state is often compared to the highest tier of legendary threats like Mega Rayquaza or Mewtwo.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 180, Defense 20, Sp. Atk 180, Sp. Def 20, Speed 150.
* **Archetype:** Ultimate Mixed Glass Cannon. With equal, world-class offensive stats and elite speed, it is designed to knock out opponents before they can retaliate.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Psychic-type, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** types. Due to its abysmal Defense and Sp. Def (20), almost any neutral hit from a fully evolved Pokémon will result in a one-hit knockout (OHKO).
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive dual-offensive stats, Deoxys-Attack excels with a diverse movepool. Key moves include **Psycho Boost** (its signature high-power STAB move), **Superpower** (to crush Dark and Steel types that resist Psychic), **Ice Beam** (for unmatched coverage against Flying and Dragon types), and **Knock Off** (to remove items and hit Ghost types).
* **Abilities:** Pressure (Forces the opponent to expend two PP per move instead of one). While tactically niche for a Pokémon with such low longevity, it can deplete the PP of powerful, low-use moves like Draco Meteor or Fire Blast if Deoxys survives a turn via a Focus Sash.

## Evolution & Biology
Deoxys-Attack is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it is biologically fluid; in various regions, it can change its form by interacting with specific Meteorites. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its biology is entirely alien, characterized by a DNA-strand-like arm structure that it can whip or form into hands for complex tasks. It is noted for its slow growth rate and extreme rarity, often only appearing in the wake of astronomical events.
