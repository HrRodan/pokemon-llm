## Identity & Lore
Electrike (Pokédex #309) is the Lightning Pokémon, a green, quadrupedal creature introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Primarily inhabiting **grasslands**, this Pokémon is defined by its ability to generate and store electricity in its stiff, long body hair. By stimulating its leg muscles with these stored electric charges, Electrike achieves explosive acceleration performance. While Electrike itself is an unevolved Pokémon, its final evolution, Manectric, gains access to a powerful **Mega Evolution** (Mega Manectric) in Generation VI.
