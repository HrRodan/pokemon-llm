## Identity & Lore
Pichu (Pokedex #172) is the Electric-type Tiny Mouse Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Small, yellow, and classified as a **Baby Pokémon**, Pichu inhabits forests and socializes in groups, though it is famously unskilled at controlling its own power. Its cheek pouches are small and cannot store electricity effectively, causing it to accidentally discharge jolts when startled, amused, or even when laughing. A unique variant known as **Spiky-eared Pichu** exists in historical records (HeartGold/SoulSilver), though it cannot evolve or be transferred. As the pre-evolution of the franchise mascot, it is inextricably linked to the potential for evolving into **Gigantamax Pikachu** or the regional **Alolan Raichu** later in its life cycle.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 20, Attack 40, Defense 15, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 35, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Little Cup (LC) Fast Frail Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground** and **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Speed and mixed offensive capabilities (often enhanced by the Light Ball item in later stages), key moves include **Volt Tackle** (its signature heavy-hitting physical STAB), **Nasty Plot** (to sharply boost Special Attack), **Thunderbolt** (reliable special damage), and **Play Rough** (physical Fairy-type coverage).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Static:** Has a 30% chance to paralyze the opponent when hit by a physical contact move.
    *   **Lightning Rod (Hidden):** Grants immunity to Electric-type moves and raises Special Attack by one stage when hit by one.

## Evolution & Biology
Pichu is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Pikachu** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (220+). Subsequently, Pikachu can evolve into **Raichu** when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. Because Pichu is a Baby Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group and cannot breed until it evolves; however, breeding a female Pikachu or Raichu holding a Light Ball will produce a Pichu with the move Volt Tackle.
