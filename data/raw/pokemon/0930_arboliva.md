## Identity & Lore
Arboliva (Pokedex #930) is the Olive Pokémon, a serene and elegant creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Standing as a tall, humanoid-shaped botanical entity, it is characterized by its deep green foliage and the nutrient-rich, flavorful oil it produces in the small fruit-like spheres on its branches. This oil is not merely a defense mechanism but a symbol of its compassionate nature; Arboliva is known to share this life-giving essence with weakened Pokémon to help them recover. Despite its peaceful demeanor, it can launch oil with enough force to shatter boulders if it or its territory is threatened. While Arboliva currently does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, its unique biology makes it a cornerstone of the Paldean ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 78, Attack 69, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 109, Speed 39.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Terrain Support. Its high Special Attack and respectable Special Defense make it a "Tanky Nuker," though its very low Speed necessitates use in Trick Room or as a reactive pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It possesses a crucial **immunity to Ghost** due to its Normal typing and **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive base 125 Special Attack, Arboliva excels with high-powered botanical and elemental attacks. Key moves include **Leaf Storm** (for massive STAB damage), **Earth Power** (to check Fire and Poison types), **Hyper Voice** (for consistent Normal-type STAB), and **Terrain Pulse**, which doubles in power and changes type to match the Grassy Terrain it frequently creates.
* **Abilities:** **Seed Sower** (Automatically activates Grassy Terrain when Arboliva is hit by an attack, providing passive healing and boosting Grass-type moves) and **Harvest** (Hidden Ability; provides a 50% chance—100% in Sunshine—to restore a consumed Berry at the end of each turn, enabling incredible longevity when paired with a Sitrus or Leppa Berry).

## Evolution & Biology
Arboliva is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Smoliv**, a small and anxious Pokémon. Smoliv evolves into **Dolliv** upon reaching **Level 25**, at which point it begins to develop its more upright, humanoid posture. The cycle concludes when Dolliv reaches **Level 35**, maturing into **Arboliva**. Biologically, it is part of the **Plant** egg group, and its growth is classified as Medium-Slow. It requires approximately 20 hatch cycles (5,120 steps) to emerge from an egg. In the wild, its presence is often indicated by the sweet, heavy scent of olives and the lush, verdant terrain that follows in its wake.
