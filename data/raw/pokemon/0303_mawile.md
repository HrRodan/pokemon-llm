## Identity & Lore
Mawile (Pokedex #303) is the **Deceiver Pokémon**, a dual-type **Steel/Fairy** creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). While it appears small and docile with a humanoid shape, its defining feature is a massive pair of black jaws emerging from the back of its head. These jaws are actually transformed steel horns that possess enough force to chew through iron beams. True to its genus, Mawile uses its cute, docile face to lull foes into a false sense of security before striking with its gaping rear jaws. It inhabits **cave** environments where it dwells in darkness. While it does not evolve by leveling up, Mawile is capable of **Mega Evolution** using the Mawilite, transforming into **Mega Mawile**, which gains the chaotic **Huge Power** ability and a second pair of jaws.
