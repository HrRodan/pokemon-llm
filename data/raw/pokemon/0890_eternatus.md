## Identity & Lore
Eternatus (Pokedex #890) is the Gigantic Pokémon, a terrifying legendary entity that serves as the centerpiece of the Galar region's history in Generation VIII. Appearing as a massive, purple, skeletal dragon-like being with a glowing core in its thorax, Eternatus is the source of the Dynamax and Gigantamax phenomena. According to Galar legend, it arrived on a meteor 20,000 years ago and attempted to absorb all of the region's energy during an event known as "The Darkest Day." While its standard form is already immense at 20 meters tall, it possesses a secondary, non-playable form known as **Eternamax Eternatus**, which it assumes when it overflows with infinite energy, becoming a colossal, coiled serpentine entity that represents the most powerful stat-spread in Pokémon history.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 140, Attack 85, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 145, Sp. Def 95, Speed 130.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Bulky Sweeper. With a massive base HP and exceptional Speed, Eternatus functions as a high-pressure legendary that can outspeed most of the roster while remaining incredibly difficult to one-shot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Psychic, Ice, and Dragon**. Its Poison/Dragon typing provides vital resistances to **Fire, Water, Electric, Poison, Fighting, and Bug**, and it boasts a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Grass**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its immense Special Attack, Eternatus dominates with **Dynamax Cannon** (which deals double damage to Dynamaxed targets), **Sludge Wave** (for powerful Poison STAB), **Flamethrower** (to melt Steel-type checks), and **Eternabeam** (its ultimate signature move). It also makes frequent use of **Recover** to capitalize on its high natural bulk.
* **Abilities:** Pressure (Forces the opponent to expend twice the PP for their moves, a tactical advantage that excels in long-form legendary battles and stalling out powerful, low-PP enemy attacks).

## Evolution & Biology
Eternatus is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It cannot evolve and does not have a pre-evolution. Biologically, it is categorized in the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its biology is unique; it does not eat organic matter but instead sustains itself by absorbing energy emanating from the Galar region's land. Its purple, crystalline structure and "wing" shape suggest an extraterrestrial origin, further supported by its arrival via meteor. It has a high hatch counter of 120 and a slow growth rate, consistent with its status as a high-tier legendary entity.
