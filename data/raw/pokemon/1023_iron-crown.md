## Identity & Lore
Iron Crown (Pokedex #1023) is a Paradox Pokémon, classified as a mysterious entity that first appeared in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It bears a striking, mechanical resemblance to the Legendary Pokémon Cobalion, though it possesses a futuristic, metallic composition and glowing digital accents. Often described in paranormal magazines as a cutting-edge weapon, this quadrupedal metallic beast is primarily found in the depths of Area Zero. While it lacks Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is part of a collective of "Future Paradox" Pokémon alongside others like Iron Valiant and Iron Leaves. Its sleek, blue-and-silver body suggests a highly advanced synthetic origin, blending ancient noble silhouettes with high-tech weaponry.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 72, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 122, Sp. Def 108, Speed 98.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper. With a high Special Attack and solid natural bulk, Iron Crown is designed to take a hit and retaliate with immense force, particularly when supported by terrain or setup moves.
* **Type Matchups:** As a **Steel/Psychic** type, it is **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark**. It boasts a massive list of **resistances**, including Normal, Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy, and it is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and signature capabilities, key moves include **Tachyon Cutter** (its signature Steel-type move that hits twice and never misses), **Expanding Force** (which becomes devastating in Psychic Terrain), **Focus Blast** (for crucial coverage against Dark and Steel types), and **Calm Mind** (to further bolster its offensive and defensive special presence).
* **Abilities:** Quark Drive (Boosts the Pokémon’s most proficient stat—usually Special Attack—when on Electric Terrain or if the Pokémon is holding a Booster Energy). This ability highlights its synergy with futuristic team compositions.

## Evolution & Biology
Iron Crown is a standalone entity and is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It is considered a Paradox relation to the "Swords of Justice" trio. Biologically, it is genderless and belongs to the **No-Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its growth rate is slow, reflecting its status as a high-power, late-game encounter. Despite its robotic appearance and lack of traditional biological functions, it exhibits highly coordinated movements and advanced tactical intelligence in battle. It is typically encountered at high levels within the Great Crater of Paldea.
