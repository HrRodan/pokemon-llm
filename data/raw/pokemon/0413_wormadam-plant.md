## Identity & Lore
Wormadam (Plant Cloak) (Pokedex #413) is the Bagworm Pokémon, a unique creature originating from the **Generation IV** region of **Sinnoh**. Distinct from other Pokémon, Wormadam is permanently fused with the natural materials of its environment; in this **Plant Cloak** form, its body has assimilated leaves, twigs, and grass, giving it a green, blob-like appearance. According to its biology, this fusion occurs when a female Burmy evolves, causing the cloak to become an inseparable part of its physiology. While this profile details the Plant Cloak variant, Wormadam possesses two other distinct forms—**Sandy Cloak** and **Trash Cloak**—depending on the environment where its pre-evolution last battled.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 59, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 79, Sp. Def 105, Speed 36.
*   **Archetype:** Special Defensive Tank / Quiver Dance Setup.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Bug/Grass** type, it suffers from critical vulnerabilities, including **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fire and Flying** moves. It is also weak to Ice, Poison, Rock, and Bug types. However, it resists Water, Electric, Fighting, Ground, and Grass moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Defense and decent Special Attack, Wormadam (Plant Cloak) functions best when utilizing **Quiver Dance** to boost its stats. Offensive pressure is best applied with **Bug Buzz** and **Leaf Storm** (or **Energy Ball** for consistency), while **Giga Drain** provides necessary sustain to keep it in battle.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Anticipation:** The Pokémon can sense if the opponent has a dangerous move (specifically One-Hit KO moves or moves effective against it, such as Fire-type attacks).
    *   **Overcoat (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from weather damage (like Sandstorm or Hail) and powder-based moves (like Sleep Powder or Spore), enhancing its durability against stall teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Wormadam is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line with a unique gender-based split. It evolves from **Burmy** starting at **Level 20**, but only if the Burmy is **Female**. The specific form (Plant Cloak) is determined if Burmy's last battle took place in a grassy area or forest prior to evolution; once evolved, the form cannot be changed. If the evolving Burmy is **Male**, it will instead evolve into **Mothim**. Wormadam belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group.
