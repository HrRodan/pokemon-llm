## Identity & Lore
Shaymin (Land Forme) (Pokedex #492) is the Gratitude Pokémon, a Mythical creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Resembling a small white hedgehog with green grass-like fur and pink flowers, it lives in flower patches and avoids detection by curling up to disguise itself as a flowering plant. Shaymin is celebrated in lore for its ability to dissolve airborne toxins, instantly transforming ruined land into lush fields of flowers. While this is its default state, this Pokémon possesses a secondary airborne state known as **Shaymin (Sky Forme)**, which it transforms into when exposed to a **Gracidea Flower** during the daytime.
