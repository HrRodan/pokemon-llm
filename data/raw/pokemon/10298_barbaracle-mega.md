## Identity & Lore
Mega Barbaracle (Pokedex #10298) is the Collective Pokémon, a formidable and complex organism originally discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). While standard Barbaracle are known for their brown, stony carapaces and multi-limbed physiology, this Mega Evolved state pushes its physical power to the absolute limit. This Pokémon is the result of two Binacle multiplying into a unified consciousness of seven distinct limbs, each possessing its own will but acting under the absolute command of the head. Its lore describes it as having the combined strength of seven powerful warriors, making it a terrifying presence on the battlefield. As a "Collective Pokémon," its body is a highly coordinated machine of bone and rock, capable of delivering strikes from angles that most opponents cannot anticipate.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Barbaracle is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Binacle**, a Pokémon consisting of two individuals living on a single rock. Binacle evolves into **Barbaracle** upon reaching **Level 39**, at which point the two individuals split and multiply into the seven-part collective. The transformation into its Mega form is triggered through the use of a Mega Stone, allowing the seven limbs to achieve perfect synchronization and hardened defenses. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 3** egg group, and despite its stony appearance, it retains biological ties to coastal environments and aquatic organisms. It has a hatch counter of 20, making it a moderately intensive Pokémon to breed for competitive use.
