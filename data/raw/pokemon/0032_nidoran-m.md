## Identity & Lore
Nidoran♂ (Pokedex #032) is the Poison Pin Pokémon, a small, quadrupedal creature distinct for its purple coloration and large ears. Indigenous to the **Generation I (Kanto)** region, this Pokémon frequents grassland habitats where it uses its sensitive ears to monitor its surroundings for potential threats. Its biology is centered around toxicity; the larger its horns grow, the more potent the secreted venom becomes. Uniquely, Nidoran♂ was one of the first Pokémon to display distinct sexual dimorphism, serving as the male counterpart to Nidoran♀.
