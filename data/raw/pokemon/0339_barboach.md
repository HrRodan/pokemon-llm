## Identity & Lore
Barboach (Pokédex #339) is the Whiskers Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Ground creature first discovered in the Hoenn region (Generation III). Residing primarily in the murky waters and mudbanks of the water's edge, this gray, loach-like Pokémon relies on its slimy body to discourage predators and prevent dehydration. Its most defining features are its sensitive whiskers, which function as a superb radar system, allowing Barboach to detect prey while burying itself completely in the mud to hide. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its slimy film and detection capabilities make it a fascinating biological specimen in the Pokémon world.
