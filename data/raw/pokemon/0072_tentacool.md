## Identity & Lore
Tentacool (Pokedex #072) is the **Jellyfish Pokémon**, a ubiquitous sight in the coastal waters of the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Characterized by its crystal-blue body and stinging tentacles, this Pokémon drifts passively in shallow seas, often blending in with the waves. While it appears docile, its body is largely composed of water, and anglers who accidentally hook it are often punished by its potent stinging acid. Tentacool is biologically distinct but visually similar to the **Convergent Species** known as **Toedscool** found in the Paldea region.

## Evolution & Biology
Tentacool is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Tentacruel** starting at **Level 30**. Belonging to the **Water 3** Egg Group, it is often considered a pest in various regions due to its high population density in ocean routes. While it is naturally frail physically, its evolution grants it massive increases in bulk and speed, solidifying its role as a defensive pivot.
