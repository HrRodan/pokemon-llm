## Identity & Lore
Minun (Pokedex #312) is the Electric-type "Cheering Pokémon" introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Often found inhabiting grasslands, this supportive creature is defined by its altruistic nature; it cares more about cheering on its partners than its own safety. By shorting out the electricity in its body, Minun creates brilliant showers of sparks to boost the morale of its teammates. It is famously the counterpart to Plusle, representing the negative electrical charge, while Plusle represents the positive. While Minun does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it is recognized for its distinctive cream and blue coloration and minus-sign shaped tail.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 40, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 85, Speed 95.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Support / Baton Pass Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Electric-type, it is **weak to Ground** and **resists Flying, Steel, and Electric** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and decent Special Attack, Minun functions best when utilizing **Thunderbolt** for reliable STAB damage and **Volt Switch** to pivot out of unfavorable matchups. Its utility is maximized with **Nasty Plot** to boost its Special Attack, which it can then transfer to a teammate using **Baton Pass**. Alternatively, **Encore** or **Nuzzle** provide excellent disruption.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Minus:** Increases Special Attack by 50% if an active ally has the Plus or Minus ability; primarily useful in Double Battles.
    *   **Volt Absorb (Hidden):** Restores HP if hit by an Electric-type move instead of taking damage, granting it a tactical immunity.

## Evolution & Biology
Minun is a single-stage Pokémon and **does not evolve**. It is a standalone species often appearing alongside Plusle in the wild. Minun belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20. Despite being a standalone species, its biology is deeply linked to cooperative behavior in battle, generating magnetic fields to support allies.
