## Identity & Lore
Sylveon (Pokedex #700) is the Intertwining Pokémon, a graceful Fairy-type first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. It is distinguished by its cream-colored fur and vibrant pink accents, but its most striking features are the ribbon-like feelers that sprout from its bows. These feelers emit a soothing aura that can instantly calm combatants and erase hostility. As one of the eight "Eeveelutions," Sylveon represents the bond between a Trainer and their Pokémon; it is known to wrap its feelers around its Trainer’s arm to sense their feelings as they walk together. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its introduction was a defining moment for the Fairy-type's competitive presence.

## Evolution & Biology
Sylveon is part of an eight-branch evolutionary line. It evolves from **Eevee** when it is leveled up while knowing a **Fairy-type move** and possessing a **high level of Friendship** (specifically a friendship value of 160 or higher in modern generations). This unique evolution method highlights its thematic connection to affection and bonding. Biologically, Sylveon belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group. Despite its delicate, ribboned appearance, it is a hardy quadruped capable of enduring significant special-elemental attacks, making it a mainstay in both domestic companionship and high-level competitive circuits.
