## Identity & Lore
Mega Baxcalibur (#10325) is the Ice Dragon Pokémon, representing the pinnacle of the pseudo-legendary evolutionary line native to the Paldea region (Generation IX). A towering, bipedal apex predator, it is characterized by its massive dorsal fin which functions as a thermal exchange organ. This Pokémon is capable of exhaling cryogenic breath so intensely cold that it can instantly solidify liquid-hot lava. While the standard Baxcalibur is already a formidable force, this Mega Evolution enhances its physical bulk and raw destructive power to cataclysmic levels. Its design evokes ancient apex predators, and it thrives in the harshest, frigid environments where it reigns supreme over both land and ice.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 115, Attack 175, Defense 117, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 101, Speed 87.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Wallbreaker. With a colossal Base Attack of 175 and high natural bulk, it is designed to survive hits and retaliate with overwhelming force.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, Fairy, Fighting, Rock, Steel, and Fire**. Despite its many weaknesses, it **resists Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its extraordinary Attack stat, Mega Baxcalibur excels with high-impact physical maneuvers. Key moves include **Glaive Rush** (its signature high-risk, high-reward Dragon STAB), **Icicle Crash** (for flinching and Ice-type coverage), **Dragon Dance** (to patch up its middling Speed and boost its power further), and **Earthquake** (to provide essential coverage against Steel and Fire types).
* **Abilities:** While the base form utilizes **Thermal Exchange** to increase its Attack when hit by Fire-type moves and provide immunity to the Burn status, the Mega form's physiology suggests a perfected version of this thermal regulation, making it an ultimate counter to Fire-type specialists.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Baxcalibur is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Frigibax**, which lives in caves and deep snow. Frigibax evolves into **Arctibax** starting at level 35. The transformation into the massive **Baxcalibur** occurs at level 54, a late-stage evolution typical of pseudo-legendary Pokémon. It belongs to the **Dragon** and **Mineral** Egg Groups. Biologically, its body is built for endurance, featuring a "slow" growth rate that results in a highly durable and powerful adult form. Its gray, armored hide and specialized spine allow it to manage extreme temperature shifts, converting heat into freezing energy.
