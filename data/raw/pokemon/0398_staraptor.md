## Identity & Lore
Staraptor (Pokedex #398) is the imposing **Predator Pokémon** introduced in Generation IV (**Sinnoh**). Renowned for its savage nature and aggressive temperament, this avian creature possesses a powerful physique and a distinctive red-tipped crest. Unlike many other regional birds that flee from danger, Staraptor will courageously challenge foes much larger than itself without hesitation. Its brown and white plumage, coupled with piercing eyes, marks it as an apex aerial hunter in its ecosystem. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is widely recognized as one of the most offensively potent "regional birds" in Pokémon history.
