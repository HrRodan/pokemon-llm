## Identity & Lore
Pikachu Rock Star (Pokedex #10080) is a specialized "Cosplay Pikachu" variant of the Mouse Pokémon, characterized by its edgy, leather-clad rocker aesthetic and a unique heart-shaped mark on its tail (indicating it is female). While the Pikachu species originated in the Kanto region (Generation I) and is commonly found in forests, this specific Rock Star form was introduced during the Hoenn region's Pokémon Contest Spectaculars. It is known for its high energy and performative flair, often gathering with others to build electrical charges capable of generating lightning storms. Beyond this form, the Pikachu species is famous for its Gigantamax form, which drastically increases its size and grants access to G-Max Volt Crash, as well as its historical connection to the Alolan region, where it can evolve into the dual-type Electric/Psychic Alolan Raichu.

## Evolution & Biology
Pikachu Rock Star is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this specific Cosplay variant is unique and **cannot evolve**. In its standard biological cycle, the line begins as **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+)**. A typical Pikachu would then evolve into Raichu when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. As a member of the **Ground and Fairy Egg Groups**, Pikachu has a fast growth rate but a relatively low hatch counter. Despite its small stature (0.4m) and light weight (6.0kg), its biological capacity for electricity storage is vast, making it both a popular companion and a potent threat in battle when utilizing its unique Rock Star training.
