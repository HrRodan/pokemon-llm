## Identity & Lore
Mega Aerodactyl (#10042) is the Fossil Pokémon, a terrifying prehistoric apex predator reawakened through the power of Mega Evolution. Originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I), this Rock/Flying-type was resurrected from DNA found in Old Amber. While the standard Aerodactyl is already a fierce mountain-dwelling hunter, Mega Evolution draws out its dormant genes, causing its body to partially petrify into sharp, jagged black stones. These rocky protrusions sprout from its wings, chin, and back, making it appear more primitive and savage than its modern restoration. Known to have ruled the skies during the dinosaur era, its saw-blade teeth and serrated wings allow it to tear through prey with ease. Its purple-hued body and 2.1-meter height dominate the high-altitude habitats it once called home.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 135, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 95, Speed 150.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With a blistering Speed tier of 150, Mega Aerodactyl outpaces nearly the entire unboosted metagame, acting as a premier revenge killer and offensive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Electric, Ice, Rock, and Steel**. It possesses a vital **immunity to Ground** and **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Attack and its signature ability, Mega Aerodactyl excels with contact-based and high-impact physical moves. Key selections include **Stone Edge** (high-crit STAB), **Aerial Ace** (STAB that benefits from its ability), **Crunch** (dark-type coverage for Psychic and Ghost types), and **Iron Head** (to punish Fairy and Ice types with a high flinch chance).
* **Abilities:** Tough Claws (Increases the power of moves that make physical contact by 30%). This ability is transformative, significantly boosting the damage of moves like Aerial Ace, Crunch, and Iron Head, making its effective damage output much higher than its base stats suggest.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Aerodactyl is a temporary transformation of Aerodactyl, a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve through traditional leveling. It achieves this state during battle when exposed to an **Aerodactylite Mega Stone**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Flying** egg group and requires a significant amount of time to hatch (35 hatch counters). Because it is a Fossil Pokémon, its biology is inherently linked to ancient stone, and its Mega form is said to be its "true" original appearance before the imperfections of the resurrection process via Old Amber. Its growth rate is slow, reflecting the difficulty of taming a creature that has been extinct for millions of years.
