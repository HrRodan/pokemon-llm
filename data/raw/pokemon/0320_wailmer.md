## Identity & Lore
Wailmer (Pokedex #320) is the Ball Whale Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A playful and spherical creature found in the **sea**, Wailmer is instantly recognizable by its distinct **blue** body and yellow underbelly. Its biology is unique in that its nostrils are located above its eyes, a feature it uses to startle people by forcefully snorting out stored seawater. Despite its whimsical appearance, resembling a beach ball, it possesses significant mass. While Wailmer does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its evolutionary line is renowned for its immense size, with its evolution being one of the largest Pokémon in existence.
