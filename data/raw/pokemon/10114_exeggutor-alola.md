## Identity & Lore
Alolan Exeggutor (Pokedex #10114) is the Coconut Pokémon, a towering regional variant native to the Alola region of Generation VII. Unlike its stout Kantonian counterpart, the Alolan Exeggutor has grown to a massive height of nearly 11 meters due to the abundant, year-round sunshine of the tropical islands. This intense solar energy has awakened its latent draconic powers, changing its typing from Grass/Psychic to Grass/Dragon. Its most striking feature is its incredibly long neck, which allows it to reach high foliage and whip its heads at enemies. Interestingly, it possesses a fourth head located on its tail; this head acts independently to monitor the Pokémon's rear, guarding its blind spot. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique physiology makes it one of the most visually distinct species in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 105, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 75, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Trick Room Special Tank / Mixed Breaker. With its high Special Attack and low Speed, it excels in Trick Room environments where it can strike first with devastating power.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. It is also weak to **Flying, Poison, Bug, Dragon, and Fairy**. However, it boasts incredible quadruple resistances, taking minimal damage (0.25x) from **Water, Electric, and Grass**, while also resisting **Ground**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its elite Special Attack and wide coverage, its optimal moveset includes **Draco Meteor** for massive STAB damage, **Leaf Storm** for raw Grass-type power, **Flamethrower** to incinerate Bug and Ice-type threats, and **Giga Drain** to provide essential health recovery during combat.
* **Abilities:** **Frisk** allows it to identify the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing vital tactical intelligence. Its Hidden Ability, **Harvest**, is its most competitive trait; it provides a 50% chance (100% in Harsh Sunlight) to restore a consumed Berry at the end of each turn, granting it near-infinite sustain when paired with a Sitrus or Lum Berry.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Exeggutor is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Exeggcute** when exposed to a **Leaf Stone** specifically within the Alola region or similar tropical environments. Legend states that the heads of an Exeggutor will occasionally drop off if they grow too large; these fallen heads then continue their life cycle as new Exeggcute. Biologically, it is a member of the **Plant** egg group. Trainers should note that its hatch counter is 20, and it follows a slow growth rate, requiring significant investment to reach its full potential. Despite its dragon-like neck and powers, it remains deeply rooted in its plant-based biology, thriving in forest habitats where it can blend in with tropical trees.
