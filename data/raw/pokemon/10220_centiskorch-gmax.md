## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Centiskorch (Pokedex #10220) is the colossal Gigantamax form of the Radiator Pokémon, originating from the Galar region in Generation VIII. In this state, its body length extends to a staggering 75 meters, and its internal temperature exceeds 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Its appearance shifts into a towering, multi-legged centipede-like entity with a glowing underbelly and a heat-radiating mane of fire. This form is unique to individuals possessing the Gigantamax Factor, allowing them to transform during Dynamax in specific Power Spots. It is known to lash its massive, scorching body like a whip, incinerating anything in its path. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, its Gigantamax form represents the pinnacle of its destructive heat and physical reach.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 115, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 90, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tanky Attacker. Its high base HP and Attack allow it to trade blows effectively, while its decent Special Defense helps it survive elemental assaults.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water and Flying**, and suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**. It **resists Fire, Grass (4x), Ice, Fighting, Bug, Steel, and Fairy**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high physical Attack and Gigantamax capabilities, essential moves include **Fire Lash** (a signature move that lowers the target's Defense), **Leech Life** (for high-damage STAB recovery), **Power Whip** (crucial coverage for Water and Rock-type threats), and **Coil** (to boost Attack, Defense, and Accuracy simultaneously). In its Gigantamax form, its Fire-type moves become **G-Max Centiferno**, which traps opponents in a fire vortex for four to five turns.
* **Abilities:** **Flash Fire** (Provides immunity to Fire moves and boosts its own Fire-type damage when hit by one); **White Smoke** (Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats); **Flame Body** (Hidden Ability: Has a 30% chance to burn opponents that make contact, synergizing well with its physical-fighting nature).

## Evolution & Biology
Centiskorch is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sizzlipede** starting at **Level 28**. While the standard Centiskorch is already a formidable predator in the Galar region, certain individuals can undergo the Gigantamax transformation to reach this massive form. Biologically, it is highly aggressive and territorial, using its superheated body to cook prey before consumption. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, indicating a moderate breeding cycle for trainers looking to optimize its IVs for competitive play.
