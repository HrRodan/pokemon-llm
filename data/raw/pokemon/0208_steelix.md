## Identity & Lore
Steelix (Pokedex #208) is the massive Iron Snake Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Renowned for its immense durability, this gray, mineral-based creature dwells in deep subterranean caves. It is thought its body transformed as a result of iron accumulating internally from swallowing soil, fusing with the intense underground heat and pressure to create a skin harder than diamond. While primarily found in its standard form, Steelix possesses the latent potential to undergo **Mega Evolution**, becoming Mega Steelix, where its body generates floating crystalline shards.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 85, Defense 200, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 65, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wall / Hazard Setter.
* **Type Matchups:** As a unique **Steel/Ground** type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Fire, and Water**. However, it boasts two immunities (**Poison** and **Electric**) and significant resistances against Normal, Flying, Bug, Steel, Psychic, Dragon, and Fairy types, including a **double resistance (0.25x) to Rock**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its colossal Defense and weight, key moves include **Earthquake** (consistent STAB), **Heavy Slam** (utilizing its 400kg weight), **Body Press** (calculates damage based on its Defense stat), and **Stealth Rock** (essential utility for controlling the field). **Gyro Ball** is also highly effective due to its abysmal Speed.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage from moves like Double-Edge.
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP (blocks OHKO moves).
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden):** Increases the power of moves that have secondary effects (like Iron Head or Crunch) by 30%, but removes those secondary effects.

## Evolution & Biology
Steelix is the second stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Onix** when **traded while holding a Metal Coat**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and has a medium growth rate. While Onix is made of rock, the evolutionary process compresses and hardens its composition into an iron-like alloy capable of withstanding extreme depths.
