## Identity & Lore
Mudkip (Pokedex #258) is the **Mud Fish Pokémon**, renowned as the Water-type Starter Pokémon for **Generation III (Hoenn)**. A small, blue, quadrupedal amphibian, Mudkip is designed for life at the **water's edge**. Its most defining biological feature is the fin on its head, which functions as a highly sensitive radar; by using this fin to sense movements in the water and air, Mudkip can determine what is taking place around it without relying on its eyes. While small, it possesses disproportionate strength, capable of crushing boulders larger than itself. Although it is currently in its base form, its final evolution, Swampert, is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution**.
