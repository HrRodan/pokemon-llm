## Identity & Lore
Spoink (Pokédex #325) is the Psychic-type **Bounce Pokémon** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. This Pokémon is defined by its critical physiological reliance on movement; it bounces constantly on its tail to pump its heart. According to Pokédex lore, if a Spoink ceases bouncing, its heart will stop beating, resulting in death. It carries a pearl on top of its head, which serves to amplify its **psychic powers**; lore suggests this pearl is often obtained from the Pokémon Clamperl. Spoink is typically found in mountainous habitats and is recognizable by its grey-black body, pig-like snout, and coiled spring-like tail.
