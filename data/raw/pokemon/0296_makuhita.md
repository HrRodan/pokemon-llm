## Identity & Lore
Makuhita (Pokedex #296) is the tenacious Guts Pokémon introduced in Generation III within the Hoenn region. This yellow, humanoid Pokémon inhabits mountainous areas and is renowned for its unyielding spirit; it will repeatedly stand up to attack its foe regardless of how many times it is knocked down. This strenuous physical activity causes Makuhita to store energy within its body, which is essential for its eventual evolution. Deeply inspired by sumo wrestling culture, it trains rigorously, often slamming into thick trees to build its strength. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its dedication to physical training makes it a staple of the Fighting-type roster.
