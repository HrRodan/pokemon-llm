## Identity & Lore
Chewtle (Pokedex #833) is the Snapping Pokémon, a resilient and aggressive species first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Distinguished by its green, sturdy shell and a single prominent horn on its head, Chewtle is notorious for its territorial and pugnacious nature. According to Galar legend and biological observations, the constant itch of its growing teeth impels it to snap its powerful jaws at anything that moves in front of it, often refusing to let go once it has clamped down. While it is a relatively small quadruped, it possesses a tenacity that foreshadows its powerful evolved form, Drednaw. Trainers should be aware that while Chewtle itself does not possess a Gigantamax form, its evolution, Drednaw, is one of the few Pokémon capable of undergoing Gigantamaxing, transforming into a mountain-sized titan with a shell that can withstand a direct blast from a tank.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 64, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 38, Sp. Def 38, Speed 44.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Attacker. Despite its low base speed, its access to high-tier setup moves and specialized abilities allows it to function as a potent threat in lower competitive tiers (LC).
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Steel, Fire, Water, and Ice** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its higher Physical Attack and the utility of its abilities, essential moves include **Crunch** (boosted by Strong Jaw), **Liquidation** (powerful STAB), **Ice Fang** (coverage against Grass and Dragon types), and **Shell Smash** (a premier setup move that doubles its offensive pressure and speed).
* **Abilities:** **Strong Jaw** increases the power of biting moves by 50%, making it a lethal offensive threat. **Shell Armor** provides defensive utility by protecting the Pokémon from critical hits. Its Hidden Ability, **Swift Swim**, doubles its Speed stat in rainy weather, allowing it to act as a potent Rain-team sweeper.

## Evolution & Biology
Chewtle is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable Drednaw starting at **Level 22**. This transformation sees it gain the Rock typing, significantly increasing its defensive bulk and physical power. Chewtle belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, making it biologically compatible with a wide range of amphibious and reptilian Pokémon. Its biological drive to bite is a survival mechanism that ensures its jaw muscles are sufficiently developed by the time it reaches its final form, where it becomes capable of biting through heavy steel rebar with ease.
