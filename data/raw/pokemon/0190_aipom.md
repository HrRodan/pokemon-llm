## Identity & Lore
Aipom (Pokedex #190) is the Long Tail Pokémon, a mischievous simian creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). This purple, forest-dwelling mammal is defined by its powerful, dexterous tail, which acts as a third arm. Aipom uses this tail to suspend itself from tree branches, maintain balance, and manipulate objects, often relying on it more than its actual hands. Its habitat is primarily the high canopy of forests, where it swings nimbly between trees.

## Evolution & Biology
Aipom is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Ambipom** when it levels up while knowing the move **Double Hit**. While Aipom has a single tail ending in a three-fingered hand, its evolution splits this into two tails. It belongs to the Ground (Field) Egg Group and hatches quickly compared to many other species.
