## Identity & Lore
Mega Zeraora (#10319) is the Mega Evolved form of the Mythical Thunderclap Pokémon, originating from the Alola region in Generation VII. As a humanoid, feline-inspired entity, it is characterized by its vibrant yellow fur and the intense electrical aura it radiates. This form represents the pinnacle of Zeraora's kinetic energy, manifesting the flavor text's description of a predator that electrifies its claws to tear through opponents with such speed that even those who dodge are struck by trailing sparks. While Zeraora is traditionally a standalone Mythical Pokémon discovered in the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon era, this Mega form pushes its physical and special capabilities to legendary heights. It is known to inhabit high-altitude areas where it can harness atmospheric electricity, as it lacks an internal organ to generate power and must instead absorb it from external sources.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 88, Attack 157, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 147, Sp. Def 80, Speed 153.
* **Archetype:** Elite Mixed Sweeper. With a staggering Speed stat of 153 and dual offensive stats exceeding 140, Mega Zeraora is designed to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame and strike effectively from both the physical and special sides.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Electric-type**, it is **weak to Ground**. It possesses key **resistances to Flying, Steel, and Electric** attacks. Its lack of secondary typing keeps its profile simple but leaves it vulnerable to powerful Earthquakes.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive offensive stats, Mega Zeraora excels with its signature move **Plasma Fists**, which converts Normal-type moves into Electric-type for the rest of the turn. To maintain its mixed coverage, it utilizes **Close Combat** for bulky Steel and Rock types, **Thunderbolt** for reliable special STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, and **Knock Off** or **Grass Knot** to disrupt opponents and handle Ground-type switch-ins.
* **Abilities:** While the Mega form's specific ability can vary in localized data, it traditionally retains or enhances **Volt Absorb**, which provides a tactical immunity to Electric moves and heals the Pokémon for 25% of its max HP when struck by them. This allows it to switch into Predicted Electric attacks with impunity.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Zeraora is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and does not belong to a standard evolutionary chain. It is part of the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is unique among Electric-types; rather than generating its own current, it gathers and stores electricity from the environment within its fur. This stored energy is then diverted into its limbs to provide a massive burst of speed, allowing it to move through the air at velocities comparable to a lightning strike. The transition to its Mega state further optimizes this energy conversion, resulting in the drastic increases seen in its Attack and Special Attack power. High-level trainers typically encounter Zeraora through special events, as its capture rate is exceptionally low at 3.
