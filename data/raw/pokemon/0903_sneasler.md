## Identity & Lore
Sneasler (Pokedex #903) is the Free Climb Pokémon, a tall and lean bipedal creature that first appeared in the Hisui region (Generation VIII). Originally discovered in the frozen highlands, Sneasler is a specialized regional evolution of Hisuian Sneasel, distinguished from its Johtonian relative, Weavile, by its unique Poison/Fighting typing and its preference for solitary life rather than pack hunting. Its long, sturdy claws are filled with virulent poison, allowing it to scale vertical cliffs with ease and overwhelm any species that dares to challenge its physical prowess. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Sneasler served a vital role in ancient Hisui as a Ride Pokémon, assisting humans in navigating treacherous mountain terrain.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 130, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 80, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper / Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Psychic**, and is also weak to **Flying and Ground**. It compensates with a double resistance to **Bug**, and resists **Fighting, Poison, Rock, Grass, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Attack and Speed, Sneasler excels with its signature move **Dire Claw**, which has a high chance to poison, paralyze, or sleep the target. Other optimal moves include **Close Combat** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Swords Dance** to boost its offensive presence to terrifying levels, and **Acrobatics**, which synergizes perfectly with its ability to lose held items.
* **Abilities:** **Pressure** (increases the opponent's PP usage), **Unburden** (doubles Speed upon consuming or losing a held item, making it one of the fastest threats in the competitive meta), and its Hidden Ability, **Poison Touch** (adds a 30% chance to poison the target when using contact moves).

## Evolution & Biology
Sneasler is the final stage of a two-stage regional evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hisuian Sneasel** specifically when the Pokémon is leveled up while holding a **Razor Claw during the daytime**. This stands in direct contrast to the Johtonian Sneasel, which requires the same item at night to become Weavile. Biologically, Sneasler belongs to the **Ground** egg group. It is a territorial predator that avoids social structures, relying on its potent toxins and "Free Climb" physiology to maintain dominance over high-altitude environments. Its metabolism and growth are categorized as **Medium-Slow**, reflecting the intensive energy required to maintain its lethal physical conditioning.
