## Identity & Lore
Piplup (Pokédex #393) is the **Penguin Pokémon**, a Water-type starter native to the **Sinnoh** region (**Generation IV**). Recognizable by its light blue body and thick down feathers, Piplup inhabits cold climates where its insulation guards it against freezing temperatures. It is characterized by an intense sense of pride and a stubborn nature; it notoriously refuses to accept food from humans, preferring to hunt for itself in the ocean. While it appears cute and **humanoid** in shape, it frequently falls down while walking due to poor coordination, yet it puffs out its chest unbothered by failure. As a starter Pokémon, it stands alongside Turtwig and Chimchar as a primary choice for trainers beginning their journey in Sinnoh.
