## Identity & Lore
Treecko (Pokedex #252) is the Wood Gecko Pokémon, a distinctively agile reptilian creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This green, bipedal Pokémon is primarily found in forest habitats where it utilizes small hooks on the bottom of its feet to scale vertical walls and hang upside down from branches. Renowned for its calm and cool demeanor, Treecko often attacks by slamming foes with its thick, powerful tail. As the Grass-type Starter Pokémon for the Hoenn region, it possesses significant latent potential, eventually evolving into Sceptile, which can undergo Mega Evolution to become the Grass/Dragon-type Mega Sceptile.
