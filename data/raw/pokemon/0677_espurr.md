## Identity & Lore
Espurr (Pokedex #677) is the Restraint Pokémon, a small, bipedal feline creature first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. Known for its intense, wide-eyed stare, Espurr possesses enough psychic power to blast away everything within a 300-foot radius; however, it lacks the control to manage this energy naturally. To prevent this power from leaking out, it keeps its ears folded tightly over the specialized organs that emit its telekinetic waves. While it appears expressionless and aloof, this stoicism is actually a result of the immense concentration required to keep its powers suppressed. While Espurr does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Meowstic, is famous for having dramatic physiological and movepool differences based on its gender.

## Evolution & Biology
Espurr is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Meowstic** starting at **Level 25**. This evolution is unique in the Pokémon world as the resulting Meowstic will have entirely different roles based on its gender: males focus on defensive utility and the Prankster ability, while females focus on offensive coverage and the Competitive ability. Espurr belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its mammalian biology. Its gray fur and "upright" shape make it well-adapted for urban environments where it often lingers near humans, despite its potentially volatile psychic nature.
