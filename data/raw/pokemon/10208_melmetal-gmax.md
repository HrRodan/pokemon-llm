## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Melmetal (Pokedex #10208) is the colossal Gigantamax form of the Hex Nut Pokémon, a Mythical entity originally discovered in the context of Generation VII but reaching its peak power through the Galar region's Dynamax phenomenon. Revered in ancient times for its miraculous ability to generate iron from nothingness, Melmetal was thought to have vanished until it was revitalized after a 3,000-year dormancy. In this massive form, its body becomes composed of liquid metal with a core of incredible centrifugal force. Its reach is legendary; it can strike opponents across a battlefield by extending its liquid-metal arms. While it does not have a Mega Evolution, its Gigantamax state serves as its ultimate transformation, characterized by its towering 25-meter height and its singular, glowing red eye-like core.

## Evolution & Biology
Melmetal-Gmax is the final stage of a two-stage Mythical evolutionary line. It evolves from the small, hex-nut-headed Meltan. In unique biological terms, this evolution is only possible when 400 Meltan Candies are gathered in the Pokémon GO environment, after which it can be transferred to other regions. To achieve this specific Gigantamax form, a Melmetal must possess the Gigantamax Factor, often granted by consuming Max Soup in the Isle of Armor. Melmetal belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred, and its biology is purely inorganic, characterized by a "Slow" growth rate and a high-density metallic composition weighing 1,000 kg.
