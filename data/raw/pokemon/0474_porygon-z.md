## Identity & Lore
Porygon-Z (Pokedex #474) is the Virtual Pokémon, first introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. This artificial entity is the final result of the Porygon line, modified with additional, unauthorized software intended to allow it to travel through alien dimensions. However, this programming was flawed, causing Porygon-Z to exhibit erratic behavior, twitchy movements, and a generally unstable physical form. Its body is predominantly red and detached, reflecting the corruption of its data. While it failed to achieve inter-dimensional travel, the modifications granted it immense power, albeit at the cost of the stability found in its predecessor, Porygon2.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 80, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 75, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Normal** type, it is **weak to Fighting** type moves. It possesses a critical **Immunity to Ghost** type moves but has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Special Attack (135), Porygon-Z excels with **Tri Attack** (STAB with status potential) and **Nasty Plot** (to sharply raise Special Attack). For coverage, it utilizes the "BoltBeam" combination of **Thunderbolt** and **Ice Beam**, or occasionally **Hyper Beam** for raw finishing power.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Adaptability:** Increases the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) from 1.5x to 2x. This makes its Normal-type moves devastatingly powerful.
    *   **Download:** Adjusts power based on the foe's stats, raising Attack if the foe's Defense is lower than its Sp. Def, or raising Sp. Atk if the foe's Defense is higher.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last.

## Evolution & Biology
Porygon-Z is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Porygon2** when **traded while holding a Dubious Disc**. Its base form, Porygon, evolves into Porygon2 when traded while holding an Up-Grade. This Pokémon belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, though it is genderless and can only breed with Ditto. The specific use of the "Dubious Disc" implies the software upgrade was not sanctioned by the original creators, Silph Co., contributing to its "glitched" existence.
