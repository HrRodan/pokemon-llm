## Identity & Lore
Zekrom (Pokedex #644) is the Deep Black Pokémon, a legendary figure representing the concept of Ideals within the Unova region of Generation V. This massive, bipedal draconic entity is defined by its jet-black, armored skin and a massive, cone-shaped tail that functions as a powerful aerodynamic turbine capable of generating immense electrical energy. According to Unovan mythology, Zekrom was once part of a single powerful dragon that split into two—one seeking truth and the other, Zekrom, seeking ideals to assist a hero in creating a new world. It is known to conceal itself within thunderclouds, flying across the skies and scorching the world with lightning if people lose their will to pursue their ideals. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Zekrom possesses the unique biological capability to fuse with the legendary Pokémon Kyurem via the DNA Splicers to create the formidable Black Kyurem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 150, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 120, Sp. Def 100, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Setup Sweeper. With a towering Attack stat and high natural bulk, Zekrom excels at taking hits and retaliating with overwhelming force.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dragon/Electric type, it is **weak to Ground, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It boasts a significant array of resistances, specifically **resisting Fire, Water, Grass, Flying, and Steel**, and is double resistant to **Electric**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive physical prowess and signature techniques, Zekrom’s optimal moveset includes **Bolt Strike** (a high-power physical Electric STAB), **Dragon Claw** (for reliable physical Dragon damage), **Dragon Dance** (to boost both its Speed and already lethal Attack), and **Fusion Bolt**, which gains power when influenced by its counterpart, Reshiram.
* **Abilities:** Teravolt (Zekrom’s signature ability allows its moves to ignore the defensive abilities of targets, meaning it can hit Pokémon with *Levitate* using Ground moves or bypass *Sturdy* and *Multiscale*).

## Evolution & Biology
Zekrom is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to a standard evolutionary line. It is part of the "Tao Trio" alongside Reshiram and Kyurem. Though it does not evolve, its biology is intricately linked to Kyurem; through the process of Absofusion, Zekrom can be absorbed into Kyurem to change Kyurem's form into Black Kyurem, significantly altering its stats and granting it the move *Freeze Shock*. Zekrom belongs to the **No Eggs** group and cannot be bred. Its massive weight of 345.0 kg makes it particularly susceptible to moves like *Grass Knot* and *Low Kick*, though its "Deep Black" armor provides it with high physical Defense to withstand most neutral blows.
