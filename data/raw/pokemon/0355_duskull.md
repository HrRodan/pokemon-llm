## Identity & Lore
Duskull (Pokedex #355) is the Ghost-type **Requiem Pokémon** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Resembling a macabre, floating black robe topped with a stylized skull mask, this nocturnal spirit is feared for its relentless nature. According to Hoenn folklore and biology reports, once Duskull identifies a target, it will doggedly pursue them through thick walls and obstacles until the break of dawn. It is primarily found in forests and old ruins. While it is a base form, its evolutionary line is renowned for its immense durability, and it is theoretically capable of using the **Eviolite** item to bolster its defenses further in limited combat scenarios (such as Little Cup).

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 20, Attack 40, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 90, Speed 25.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Wall / Disruptor Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ghost-type, it is **weak to Ghost and Dark** moves. It possesses valuable immunities to **Normal and Fighting** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its low offensive stats, Duskull relies on fixed damage and utility moves. An optimal set includes **Night Shade** (for consistent damage regardless of defense), **Will-O-Wisp** (to burn physical attackers), **Pain Split** (exploiting its low HP stat to heal massively), and **Trick Room** (turning its abysmal speed into an advantage) or **Shadow Sneak** for priority.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Levitate:** Grants full immunity to Ground-type moves, spikes, and toxic spikes, adding a third immunity to its profile.
    *   **Frisk (Hidden):** Reveals the item held by an opposing Pokémon upon entering battle, providing critical scouting information.

## Evolution & Biology
Duskull is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dusclops** starting at **Level 37**. Dusclops can subsequently evolve into **Dusknoir** when **traded while holding a Reaper Cloth**. Duskull belongs to the Amorphous (Indeterminate) egg group and has a fast growth rate. In the wild, it may occasionally carry a **Spell Tag** or a **Kasib Berry**.
