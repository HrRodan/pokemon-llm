## Identity & Lore
Keldeo (Pokedex #10024), specifically in its Resolute Form, is the Mythical Colt Pokémon first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. While it typically appears in its "Ordinary Form," it transforms into this Resolute state when it fills itself with determination and masters the move Secret Sword. This form is characterized by the large, dark-blue horn on its head, which acts as a sword capable of slicing through anything. As a member of the Swords of Justice alongside Cobalion, Terrakion, and Virizion, Keldeo is a heroic figure that travels the world's waterfronts. It possesses the unique ability to blast water from its hooves, allowing it to glide across water as if it were solid ground. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its Resolute Form serves as its ultimate battle-ready state, representing its growth from a trainee to a full-fledged member of its legendary quintet.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 91, Attack 72, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 129, Sp. Def 90, Speed 108.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Wallbreaker. Its high Special Attack paired with a great Speed tier allows it to outpace many threats and punch through physical walls using its unique move mechanics.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass, Electric, Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It possesses a strong defensive profile, **resisting Fire, Water, Ice, Steel, Bug, Rock, and Dark-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Keldeo thrives when utilizing its massive Special Attack and its signature fighting-style moves. Key selections include **Secret Sword** (which deals physical damage using its Special Attack stat), **Hydro Pump** for raw Water-type power, **Scald** for consistent damage and burn utility, and **Calm Mind** to further boost its offensive presence.
* **Abilities:** Justified (Boosts the Pokémon's Attack stat by one stage when hit by a Dark-type move). While Keldeo is primarily a special attacker, this ability allows it to switch into Dark-type moves safely to gain a niche physical boost or simply negate the opponent's strategy.

## Evolution & Biology
Keldeo is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it undergoes a **Form Change** tied to its moveset; it assumes the Resolute Form immediately upon learning the move **Secret Sword**, which it typically masters at a Move Tutor or through special training events. If it forgets this move, it reverts to its Ordinary Form. As a Mythical Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its youthful "Colt" appearance, it is a formidable warrior that has been trained by the older Swords of Justice to protect Pokémon from human interference. Its high Hatch Counter (80) reflects its legendary status, and its Slow growth rate indicates the long journey it takes to reach its full combat potential.
