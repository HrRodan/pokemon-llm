## Identity & Lore
Stunky (Pokédex #434) is the Skunk Pokémon, a dual-type Poison/Dark creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Small and quadrupedal, it is characterized by its purple fur and a cream-colored stripe running down its spine. Stunky is infamous for its potent biological defense mechanism; it protects itself by spraying a noxious fluid from its rear when threatened. This foul-smelling secretion is so powerful that the stench lingers for 24 hours and can be smelled from over a mile away. It is primarily nocturnal and shares the Ground (Field) Egg Group with many terrestrial mammals.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 63, Attack 63, Defense 47, Sp. Atk 41, Sp. Def 41, Speed 74.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker / Utility Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** Due to its unique Poison/Dark typing, Stunky possesses excellent defensive synergy. It is **weak only to Ground-type** moves. It holds an **immunity to Psychic-type** attacks and **resists Ghost, Dark, Poison, and Grass-type** damage. Notably, its Poison typing neutralizes the standard Dark-type weaknesses to Fighting, Bug, and Fairy moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its higher Attack and Speed stats, key moves include **Sucker Punch** (priority STAB), **Poison Jab** (reliable STAB with poison chance), **Crunch** (strong Dark damage), and **Play Rough** (coverage against Fighting and Dragon types). It can also utilize **Explosion** or **Memento** as a final gambit.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Stench:** Attacks have a 10% chance of causing the target to flinch.
    *   **Aftermath:** If Stunky is knocked out by a contact move, the attacker loses 1/4 of its maximum HP.
    *   **Keen Eye (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon's accuracy from being lowered and ignores the opponent's evasion boosts.
