## Identity & Lore
Gumshoos (Pokedex #735) is the Stakeout Pokémon, a distinctive Normal-type introduced in Generation VII (Alola). Measuring 0.7 meters and weighing 14.2 kg, this brown, quadrupedal Pokémon is renowned for its incredible tenacity and patience when hunting. As its genus suggests, it behaves like a detective, identifying the trails of its favorite prey—predominantly Rattata and Raticate—and waiting at their burrows for hours without moving. Despite its intense focus during the day, it is known to succumb to exhaustion and is typically found snoozing by nightfall. In the Alola region, Gumshoos is famously recognized as a Totem Pokémon encountered during the Island Challenge in Verdant Cavern. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence in the Paldea region (Generation IX) confirms its continued relevance in varied ecological climates.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 88, Attack 110, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 60, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker. Gumshoos is designed to punish switching and deliver massive physical damage, though it suffers from low Speed and mediocre defensive bulk.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a natural **immunity to Ghost**. It has no resistances, making it a "neutral" sponge for most elemental attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high base Attack, Gumshoos excels with moves like **Double-Edge** (high-powered STAB), **Crunch** (synergizes with Strong Jaw), **Earthquake** (essential Ground coverage), and **Psychic Fangs** (to break screens and hit Fighting types).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Stakeout:** A signature tactical ability that deals double damage to any Pokémon that switches into battle mid-turn. 
    * **Strong Jaw:** Increases the power of biting moves (like Crunch, Fire Fang, and Psychic Fangs) by 50%. 
    * **Adaptability (Hidden):** Increases the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) for Normal-type moves from 1.5x to 2x, making its STAB moves devastating.

## Evolution & Biology
Gumshoos is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Yungoos** starting at **Level 20**, but only when the evolution occurs during the **daytime**. Originally an invasive species brought to Alola to control the population of other Pokémon, it has since integrated into the ecosystem. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group, and wild specimens are occasionally found carrying a **Pecha Berry**, likely a necessity to recover from the toxins of the prey it pursues. It has a medium growth rate and a hatch counter of 15, making it a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders.
