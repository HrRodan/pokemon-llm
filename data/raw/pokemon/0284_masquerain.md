## Identity & Lore
Masquerain (Pokedex #284) is the Eyeball Pokémon, a unique Bug/Flying-type introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily at the **water's edge**, this Pokémon is distinct for the large, eye-like patterns on its antennae, which are used to **intimidate** predators by mimicking the face of a much larger creature. Masquerain possesses exceptional aerial maneuverability; it flaps its four wings to hover and fly in any direction—including sideways and backwards—functioning aerodynamically like a helicopter. Its vivid blue coloration allows it to blend in with the ponds and lakes it inhabits. Unlike its pre-evolution, which skates on water, Masquerain is airborne, though it retains a strong biological connection to aquatic environments.

## Evolution & Biology
Masquerain is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Surskit** starting at **Level 22**. Uniquely, this evolution causes a type change from Bug/Water to Bug/Flying, though it retains the ability to use powerful Water-type moves. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Bug** Egg Groups and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
