A master of courtesy and swordsmanship, this noble, humanoid Pokémon fights using extendable swords located on its elbows. Gallade is white in color and is characterized by its chivalric dedication to protecting allies. While it does not have a regional variant, it is capable of **Mega Evolution** using the Galladite, transforming into Mega Gallade.
