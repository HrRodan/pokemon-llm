## Identity & Lore
Smoliv (Pokedex #928) is the Olive Pokémon, a small Grass/Normal-type species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is characterized by the large, oil-filled fruit atop its head, which it uses as a deterrent against predators. The oil is famously bitter and astringent, capable of making any attacker flinch from the shock of the taste and smell. In the wild, Smoliv prefers sun-drenched environments where it can photosynthesize efficiently, storing the resulting nutrients as oil. While Smoliv does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Arboliva, is known for its majestic presence and its ability to transform the battlefield into Grassy Terrain.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 41, Attack 35, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 58, Sp. Def 51, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Special-Oriented Defensive Support. Given its low speed and relatively higher Special Attack and Special Defense for its stage, it functions best as a slow, methodical special attacker with high sustain.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types, and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost**-type moves due to its Normal typing.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Giga Drain** (for STAB damage and recovery), **Energy Ball** (for high-power STAB), **Earth Power** (for critical coverage against Fire and Poison types), and **Strength Sap** (to lower the opponent's Attack while providing massive healing).
* **Abilities:** **Early Bird** allows Smoliv to wake up from sleep status twice as fast as other Pokémon, making it resilient against sleep-inducing moves like Spore or Hypnosis. Its Hidden Ability, **Harvest**, provides a 50% chance (100% in Sun) to restore a consumed Berry at the end of each turn, granting it incredible competitive longevity when holding items like a Sitrus or Leppa Berry.

## Evolution & Biology
Smoliv is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dolliv** starting at Level 25, which eventually matures into the powerful **Arboliva** at Level 35. Biologically, Smoliv belongs to the **Plant** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its botanical nature. It is a hardy species that can survive for long periods without drinking, instead relying on the nutrient-rich oil stored in its head-fruit. Despite its timid appearance, its evolutionary path leads to a Pokémon capable of providing immense support to its allies through terrain manipulation.
