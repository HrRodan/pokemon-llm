## Identity & Lore
Kingdra (Pokedex #230) is the Dragon Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Dragon creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing in the deep ocean, this species is known for its immense power and dormancy; it usually hides in deep underwater caves to conserve energy. Kingdra's respiratory power is formidable—it creates massive whirlpools simply by yawning. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biological composition makes it a significant threat in marine environments. Its scales are typically blue, and it falls under the "Dragon Pokémon" genus.

## Evolution & Biology
Kingdra is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins as Horsea and evolves into Seadra starting at Level 32. To reach its final form, Seadra must be **traded while holding a Dragon Scale**. This evolution method highlights its deep-sea nature and connection to draconic items. Kingdra belongs to the **Water 1** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
