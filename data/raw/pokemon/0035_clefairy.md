## Identity & Lore
Clefairy (Pokedex #035) is the iconic **Fairy Pokémon** introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its magical and cute appeal, this rare, pink creature is typically found in mountainous environments such as **Mt. Moon**, where it is known to dance under the light of the full moon. Folklore suggests Clefairy may have extraterrestrial origins, coming to Earth on a comet. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is historically significant as one of the original mascots considered for the franchise.
