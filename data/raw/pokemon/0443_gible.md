## Identity & Lore
Gible (Pokedex #443) is the Land Shark Pokémon, a dual-type Dragon/Ground creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). This blue, bipedal Pokémon is characterized by its large mouth filled with sharp teeth and its dorsal fin, foreshadowing its predatory nature. Gible inhabits geothermal caves, nesting in small, horizontal holes in the rock walls where it waits to pounce on prey that strays too close. As the initial stage of a "pseudo-legendary" evolutionary line, Gible possesses immense latent potential, destined to evolve into the Mach-speed predator Garchomp, which is capable of Mega Evolution.
