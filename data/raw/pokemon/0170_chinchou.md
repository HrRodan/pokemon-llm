## Identity & Lore
Chinchou (Pokédex #170) is the Angler Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Electric deep-sea dweller introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing in the dark ocean depths where sunlight cannot reach, this Pokémon relies on the two antennae protruding from its back, which are tipped with bioluminescent orbs generated by electricity-generating cells. Chinchou communicate with one another by blinking their shining antennae to claim territory and communicate in the darkness. While primarily aquatic, its unique physiology allows it to discharge electricity to deter predators or shock prey.
