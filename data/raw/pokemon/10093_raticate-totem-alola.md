## Identity & Lore
Totem Alolan Raticate (Pokedex #10093) is the Alolan variant of the Mouse Pokémon, specifically a "Totem" individual encountered during the Island Challenge of the Alola region in Generation VII. Standing at 1.4 meters and weighing a massive 105.0 kg, this specimen is significantly larger and heavier than its standard counterparts. It is primarily found in the Alola region, where it adapted to an urban, nocturnal lifestyle, leading to its Dark/Normal typing. According to local lore, its whiskers are essential for balance; should they be damaged, its mobility is severely hampered. As a Totem Pokémon, it is often surrounded by an aura that boosts its defensive stats at the start of battle. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Totem Pokémon makes it a unique boss-class entity in the Alolan ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 71, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 80, Speed 77.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Revenge Killer.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting** and is also weak to **Bug and Fairy**. However, it possesses unique immunities, being completely **immune to Psychic and Ghost** type moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its physical bias and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), effective moves include **Crunch** for reliable Dark-type damage, **Double-Edge** for high-power Normal-type impact, **Sucker Punch** for essential priority, and **U-turn** to maintain offensive momentum. **Swords Dance** can also be utilized to supplement its modest base Attack.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Gluttony:** Causes the Pokémon to consume held berries (like its Pecha Berry) at 50% HP instead of 25%.
    * **Hustle:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% but lowers the accuracy of physical moves by 20%, making it a high-risk, high-reward attacker.
    * **Thick Fat (Hidden):** Provides excellent defensive utility by halving the damage taken from Fire-type and Ice-type moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Alolan Raticate is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Alolan Rattata** when leveled up to **Level 20 during the Night**. Biologically, this variant is distinct from the Kanto form due to its darker fur and increased bulk, a result of competing for high-calorie foods in Alolan cities. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15. Despite its increased size as a Totem variant, it retains the fundamental biology of the Raticate species, including a quadrupedal shape and a focus on its powerful incisors for both feeding and combat.
