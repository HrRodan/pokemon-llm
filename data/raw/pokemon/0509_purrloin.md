## Identity & Lore
Purrloin (Pokedex #509) is the Devious Pokémon, a feline species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This purple, quadrupedal Pokémon is notorious for its mischievous nature, frequently stealing from humans and other Pokémon just for the sake of amusement. It maintains a "deceptively cute" facade, using its charming appearance to disarm its victims so they cannot help but forgive its thievery. While Purrloin primarily walks on all fours, it is capable of standing and walking on its hind legs to further its deceptive antics. Although it currently lacks a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its evolved form, Liepard, is highly regarded in competitive circles for its utility and speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Purrloin is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Liepard** upon reaching **Level 20**. Biologically, Purrloin is highly adaptable and belongs to the **Ground** egg group, requiring approximately 20 hatch cycles (5,120 steps) to emerge from an egg. It is known for its sharp claws and lithe body, which it uses to scale surfaces or escape quickly after a successful theft. Its fur is a distinct shade of purple with cream-colored accents around its eyes and paws, a coloration that aids its stealth during nighttime activities.
