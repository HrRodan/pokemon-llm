## Identity & Lore
Dwebble (#557) is the Rock Inn Pokémon, a unique Bug and Rock-type species first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Resembling a small hermit crab, Dwebble is best known for its resourceful behavior: it uses a corrosive liquid secreted from its mouth to melt holes into rocks, crafting a portable sturdy shell that it carries on its back for protection. This "inn" is vital to its survival; if the rock breaks or becomes too small, the Pokémon becomes intensely anxious until it finds a suitable replacement. While Dwebble does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Crustle, is famous for its massive, sediment-layered shell that resembles a block of the earth’s crust. Dwebble is typically found in rocky terrain, deserts, and seaside cliffs where it can scavenge for durable minerals.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 65, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 35, Speed 55.
*   **Archetype:** Set-up Sweeper / Entry Hazard Lead. In competitive formats like Little Cup, Dwebble is a premier threat due to its access to powerful boosting and utility moves.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Normal and Poison** types. Its Rock-typing helpfully neutralizes the traditional Bug-type weaknesses to Fire and Flying.
*   **Move Selection:** Dwebble’s strategy revolves around its Physical Attack and its signature boosting move. Key moves include:
    *   **Shell Smash:** Drastically lowers Defense and Sp. Def to sharply increase Attack, Sp. Atk, and Speed, transforming it into a fast sweeper.
    *   **X-Scissor:** A reliable physical Bug-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move.
    *   **Rock Blast:** A multi-strike Rock-type STAB move that can break through "Sturdy" abilities or "Substitute" users.
    *   **Stealth Rock:** A vital utility move used to set hazards on the opponent's side of the field.
*   **Abilities:** 
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full HP, allowing it to guaranteed-setup a Shell Smash or Stealth Rock.
    *   **Shell Armor:** Protects the Pokémon from critical hits, ensuring consistent defensive calculations.
    *   **Weak Armor (Hidden):** Increases Speed by two stages but lowers Defense by one stage when hit by a physical attack, providing an alternative path to high mobility.

## Evolution & Biology
Dwebble is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Crustle** once it reaches **Level 34**. Biologically, this evolution represents the Pokémon outgrowing its small pebble and moving into a massive, heavy slab of stratified earth. Dwebble belongs to both the **Bug** and **Mineral** Egg Groups, making it a versatile breeding partner for other shell-dwelling or rocky species. Trainers seeking Dwebble in the wild should look for specimens carrying a **Rare Bone** or **Hard Stone**, items it occasionally integrates into its rocky dwelling. Its hatch cycle is approximately 20 (5,120–5,376 steps), reflecting its steady, methodical nature.
