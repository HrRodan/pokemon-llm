## Identity & Lore
Pikachu Pop Star (Pokedex #10082) is a specialized "Cosplay Pikachu" variant of the Mouse Pokémon, distinguished by its elaborate pink idol-inspired costume and the unique heart-shaped mark on its tail. While the base species originated in Generation I (Kanto), this specific Pop Star form was introduced in the Hoenn region during Generation VI (Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire) as a star of the Pokémon Contest Spectaculars. It is a quadruped, yellow-furred rodent that stores electricity in its red cheek pouches, which can become so potent that groups of them can trigger lightning storms. While this specific form cannot evolve, the broader Pikachu species is famous for its Gigantamax form, which transforms it into a massive, "chunky" silhouette reminiscent of its original 1996 design, and its ability to utilize a Z-Move known as Catastropika.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 55, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Fast Glass Cannon / Mixed Attacker. In competitive play, this Pokémon is almost exclusively seen holding its signature item, the **Light Ball**, which doubles its Attack and Special Attack stats, compensating for its low base numbers.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a pure Electric-type, making it **weak to Ground**. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** This form is unique for its access to **Draining Kiss**, a Fairy-type move that provides coverage against Fighting and Dragon types while restoring HP. Capitalizing on its stats and the Light Ball boost, its key moves include **Thunderbolt** (reliable STAB), **Volt Switch** (for pivoting out of danger), and **Nuzzle** (for guaranteed paralysis utility).
* **Abilities:** **Static** (Contact moves against it have a 30% chance of paralyzing the attacker) and **Lightning Rod** (Provides immunity to Electric-type moves and boosts Special Attack when hit by one).

## Evolution & Biology
Pikachu Pop Star is a unique member of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this specific Cosplay variant is incapable of evolving. The standard biological cycle begins with **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+)**. A standard Pikachu would typically evolve into Raichu when exposed to a **Thunder Stone** (or Alolan Raichu if used in the Alola region). However, the Pop Star Pikachu is dedicated to its craft and cannot evolve into Raichu or breed. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy Egg Groups**. In its natural habitat, Pikachu are often found in forests, though the Pop Star variant is synonymous with the stage lights of the Hoenn region's contest halls.
