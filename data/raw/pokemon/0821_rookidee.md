## Identity & Lore
Rookidee (Pokedex #821) is the Tiny Bird Pokémon and serves as the iconic early-route avian species of the Galar region, first discovered in Generation VIII. Despite its small stature and delicate blue plumage, Rookidee is famously feisty and territorial; it possesses a fearless temperament that drives it to challenge much larger and more powerful opponents. This combat-oriented biology ensures that even in defeat, Rookidee gains experience and grit, eventually maturing into the formidable Corvisquire and finally the steel-clad Corviknight. While Rookidee itself does not possess alternate forms, its final evolution, Corviknight, is renowned for its Gigantamax form and its role as the primary transport for the Galar Taxi service.
