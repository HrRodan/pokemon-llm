## Identity & Lore
Tadbulb (Pokedex #938) is the EleTadpole Pokémon, a small, floating yellow creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It resembles a glowing lightbulb combined with a tadpole, possessing a translucent body that flickers with internal bio-electricity. Tadbulb generates its power by rapidly shaking its tail, and it uses its luminous head as a communication tool; when it senses a threat, it blinks its head on and off like a beacon to warn others of its kind. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Bellibolt, is well-known as the partner Pokémon of the Levincia Gym Leader and influencer, Iono. These Pokémon are typically found near bodies of water or in damp areas where they can easily conduct and store energy.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 61, Attack 31, Defense 41, Sp. Atk 59, Sp. Def 35, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Low-Tier Special Pivot. Given its significantly higher Special Attack compared to its physical power, Tadbulb functions best as a disruptor or hit-and-run attacker in early-game scenarios.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Electric-type, it is **weak to Ground** and provides no immunities. It effectively **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its special offensive capabilities and utility, key moves include **Thunderbolt** for reliable high-damage STAB, **Volt Switch** for pivoting out of unfavorable matchups, **Parabolic Charge** to deal damage while sustaining its HP, and **Acid Spray** to sharply lower the target's Special Defense, making its following attacks even more potent.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused, ensuring it never hits itself in its confusion.
    * **Static:** A defensive asset that has a 30% chance to paralyze any opponent that makes contact with a physical move.
    * **Damp (Hidden Ability):** Prevents all Pokémon on the field from using self-destructing moves like Self-Destruct or Explosion.

## Evolution & Biology
Tadbulb is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the much larger and bulkier Bellibolt when **exposed to a Thunder Stone**. Despite its amphibious appearance, it is remarkably light, weighing only 0.4kg, allowing it to float through the air. It belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group, which is unusual for a pure Electric-type, though it reflects its tadpole-based biology. Breeders should note a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively quick Pokémon to hatch from an egg. Its growth rate is categorized as medium, allowing it to reach its full potential at a steady pace as it prepares for its transition into a defensive powerhouse.
