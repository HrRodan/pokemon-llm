## Identity & Lore
Surskit (Pokedex #283) is the Pond Skater Pokémon, a distinct **Bug/Water** dual-type introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Characterized by its blue, spherical body and long, slender legs, Surskit utilizes surface tension to glide across the water's surface. It secretes a thick, sweet oil from the tips of its feet, which not only facilitates this skating movement but also attracts prey. Surskit is typically found in the **waters-edge** habitat of ponds and lakes, where it feeds on microscopic organisms. Uniquely, when it senses danger, it secretes a thick, syrupy fluid similar to honey to deter predators. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is notable for being one of the few Pokémon to undergo a drastic type change upon evolution, losing its Water typing.
