## Identity & Lore
Silvally (Pokedex #773) is the Synthetic Pokémon, a unique biological chimera first introduced in the Alola region (Generation VII). Originally developed by the Aether Foundation under the code name "Type: Full," it was engineered specifically to serve as a versatile "Beast Killer" capable of combating Ultra Beasts. This gray, quadrupedal Pokémon is a masterpiece of bio-engineering, featuring a body composed of genetic material from various species, including avian talons, a fish-like tail, and mammalian musculature. Silvally is the "awakened" form of Type: Null; it emerges when the Pokémon finds a partner it trusts implicitly, allowing it to shatter the heavy control mask that previously suppressed its power and dampened its senses. While Silvally does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique genetic makeup allows it to perform a "Type Shift" that mirrors the versatility of the mythical Pokémon Arceus.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 95, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 95, Speed 95.
* **Archetype:** Versatile Jack-of-all-Trades / Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** In its base form, Silvally is a **Normal-type**, making it **weak to Fighting** and **immune to Ghost**. However, its RKS System allows it to become any of the 18 types depending on the held "Memory" item.
* **Move Selection:** Silvally possesses a balanced offensive spread, allowing it to utilize its signature move **Multi-Attack** (which changes type to match Silvally's current form) with high efficiency. To maximize its utility and offensive pressure, it often runs **Parting Shot** for momentum, **Swords Dance** for setup, and **Iron Head** or **Crunch** for specialized coverage.
* **Abilities:** RKS System (The Pokémon's type changes to match the Memory disc it is currently holding, also altering the type of its signature move, Multi-Attack).

## Evolution & Biology
Silvally is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Type: Null once it achieves a high bond of friendship (min_happiness 160) and levels up. This evolution is unique because it is a biological "unshackling" rather than a standard growth phase; the shattering of its mask significantly increases its speed and grants it the RKS System ability. As a synthetic life form, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group and cannot be bred. Despite its artificial origins, Silvally's flavor text emphasizes that its true power is only accessible through emotional connection with a trainer, highlighting its shift from a mindless weapon to a sentient partner.
