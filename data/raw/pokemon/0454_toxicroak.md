## Identity & Lore
Toxicroak (Pokedex #454) is the Toxic Mouth Pokémon, a dual-type Poison/Fighting creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its lethal combat capabilities, Toxicroak possesses knuckle claws on its hands that secrete a toxin so vile that even a mere scratch can prove fatal to its opponents. It stores this potent poison in a specialized sac located in its throat, which it croaks to churn and intensify before battle. While primarily blue in coloration with a humanoid shape, its design draws heavy inspiration from poison dart frogs. Toxicroak does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 83, Attack 106, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 86, Sp. Def 65, Speed 85.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper / Rain Team Abuser.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Psychic** attacks. It is also weak to **Ground and Flying** types. However, it strongly **resists Bug (4x)**, along with Rock, Dark, Grass, Poison, and Fighting types.

* **Abilities:**
    *   **Anticipation:** The Pokémon can sense if the foe has dangerous moves (Super Effective attacks or OHKO moves).
    *   **Dry Skin:** A defining tactical ability that allows Toxicroak to restore HP when hit by Water-type moves (granting immunity) or during Rain, but causes it to take damage in harsh sunlight and take more damage from Fire-type moves.
    *   **Poison Touch (Hidden):** Attacks that make direct contact have a 30% chance of poisoning the target.

## Evolution & Biology
Toxicroak is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Croagunk** when it reaches **Level 37**. In the wild, it is occasionally found holding **Black Sludge**, an item that gradually heals Poison-types. It belongs to the **Human-Like** Egg Group.
