## Identity & Lore
Turtwig (Pokedex #387) is the Tiny Leaf Pokémon first introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)** as the region's Grass-type Starter Pokémon. Resembling a small snapping turtle or tortoise, this quadrupedal Pokémon is primarily green in color with a yellow lower jaw and feet. Its biology is unique in that its body is physically constituted from soil; the earthen shell on its back hardens significantly when it drinks water. It generally inhabits areas near lakes to maintain hydration. The seedling growing on its head serves as a vital biological indicator, wilting when the Pokémon becomes thirsty.
