## Identity & Lore
Greninja-Mega (Pokedex #10294), commonly recognized in lore as **Ash-Greninja**, is the final form of the Water-type starter from the Kalos region (Generation VI). As the Ninja Pokémon, it is a master of stealth and speed, characterized by its sleek, blue humanoid physique and its long, prehensile tongue which it wraps around its neck like a scarf. This specific form represents a unique phenomenon known as the **Bond Phenomenon**, where the Pokémon’s strength increases significantly due to its connection with its Trainer, mirroring the Trainer's appearance. While categorized here as "Mega," it is canonically triggered by the **Battle Bond** ability rather than a Mega Stone. It is famous for creating throwing stars out of compressed water—shurikens so sharp and fast they can slice through solid metal.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 72, Attack 125, Defense 77, Sp. Atk 133, Sp. Def 81, Speed 142.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper / Glass Cannon. With a blistering Speed tier of 142, it outpaces almost the entire unboosted metagame, serving as a premier revenge killer and late-game cleaner.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass, Electric, Fighting, Bug, and Fairy**. It **resists Ghost, Steel, Fire, Water, Ice, and Dark**, and possesses a complete **immunity to Psychic** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Special Attack and Speed, Greninja-Mega excels with moves such as **Water Shuriken** (a signature priority move that hits multiple times), **Dark Pulse** (STAB with a flinch chance), **Hydro Pump** (maximum damage output), and **Ice Beam** (essential coverage for Grass and Dragon-type threats). 
* **Abilities:** **Battle Bond** (The primary driver for this form; it transforms Greninja into this powered-up state after it knocks out an opposing Pokémon, specifically boosting the power of Water Shuriken). In its standard state, it may also possess **Protean** (changing its type to match the move it uses) or **Torrent**.

## Evolution & Biology
Greninja-Mega is the pinnacle of a three-stage evolutionary line originating from the Water 1 Egg Group. It begins its life as **Froakie**, a small bubble-frog Pokémon. Froakie evolves into **Frogadier** starting at **Level 16**, gaining increased agility. The final transition to **Greninja** occurs at **Level 36**. The transformation into the Mega/Ash-Greninja form is temporary and combat-dependent, reflecting a deep biological and emotional synchronicity. Despite its frail defensive stats (Defense 77 and HP 72), its biology is optimized for "one-hit" tactics and rapid retreats. It has a medium-slow growth rate and is typically found in urban environments or near bodies of water in the Kalos region.
