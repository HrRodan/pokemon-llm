## Identity & Lore
Varoom (Pokedex #965) is the Single-Cyl Pokémon, a unique biomechanical entity first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This gray, metallic Pokémon is the result of an unusual biological fusion: it is said to have been born when an unidentified Poison-type Pokémon entered and inhabited a discarded engine in a scrap-processing factory. Varoom's physiology is inextricably linked to industrial machinery, as it consumes minerals from rocks to generate the energy it needs to function. In the wild, it is often found in rocky areas or industrial zones, where it clings to cliffsides or barrels along the ground with high-speed rotations. While Varoom does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Revavroom, serves as the primary engine for the massive "Starmobiles" used by the various squads of Team Star, highlighting the species' immense power and mechanical utility.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 70, Defense 63, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 45, Speed 47.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tanky Attacker. While its base stats are modest as an unevolved Pokémon, its high physical Attack and Defense allow it to function as a durable brawler in lower-tier play.
* **Type Matchups:** It possesses a unique Steel/Poison typing. It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground** and a standard weakness to **Fire**. Conversely, it is **immune to Poison** and boasts incredible resistances, including **4x resistances to Grass, Fairy, and Bug**, and 2x resistances to Normal, Ice, Flying, Rock, Steel, and Dragon.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its significantly higher Physical Attack, essential moves for Varoom include **Gunk Shot** (high-power STAB), **Iron Head** (reliable flinch potential), **Poison Jab** (consistent STAB), and its signature mechanical move **Spin Out**, which deals massive damage at the cost of lowering its own Speed.
* **Abilities:** **Overcoat** (Protects the Pokémon from weather-related damage like Sandstorm and prevents effects from "powder" moves like Sleep Powder or Spore). **Slow Start** (Hidden Ability: Temporarily halves the Pokémon's Attack and Speed for five turns, representing a cold engine warming up).

## Evolution & Biology
Varoom is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the multi-cylinder **Revavroom** once it reaches **Level 40**. Biologically, Varoom functions like an internal combustion engine, emitting toxic gases from its exhaust-like appendages as it filters minerals for fuel. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, reflecting its metallic composition and inorganic origins. Despite its mechanical appearance, it is a living creature that requires social interaction and proper maintenance to prevent its "engine" from stalling.
