## Identity & Lore
Alolan Geodude (Pokedex #10109) is the Rock Pokémon, a regional variant adapted to the magnetic volcanic fields of the Alola region. While its species was originally discovered in Generation I (Kanto), this specific form emerged in Generation VII, possessing a unique dual Rock and Electric typing. Its body is composed of magnetic stone, often coated in black iron sand that gathers around its head and body like coarse hair. These Pokémon are commonly found in mountainous habitats and fields, where they are frequently mistaken for ordinary boulders by travelers. Alolan Geodude are known to be particularly temperamental when stepped on, discharging electricity as a defense mechanism. It is occasionally found holding a Cell Battery, which it uses to store surplus electrical energy.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Geodude is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Alolan Graveler upon reaching Level 25. To reach its final form, Alolan Golem, an Alolan Graveler must be traded to another Trainer, triggering a physiological change that incorporates a large, magnetic railgun-like structure on its back. This species belongs to the Mineral egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it a relatively accessible Pokémon for early-game breeding and competitive training. Its biological composition is heavily influenced by the high iron content found in Alolan soil, distinguishing its physical and chemical properties from the standard Kantonian variant.
