## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Blastoise (Pokedex #10197) is the Shellfish Pokémon, a colossal Gigantamax variant of the iconic Water-type starter originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). While a standard Blastoise is recognized for the twin pressurized water cannons extending from its shell, the Gigantamax factor—specifically found within the Galar region—transforms its shell into a fortress-like structure bristling with 31 cannons of varying sizes. This form is characterized by its immense scale, reaching a height of 25 meters, and its ability to fire concentrated water blasts that can punch through mountains. Beyond this Gigantamax form, Blastoise is also capable of undergoing Mega Evolution, where it develops a single, massive central cannon. Its natural habitat is typically at the water's edge, though this specific form is summoned primarily in Power Spots.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass and Electric** types. It effectively **resists Steel, Fire, Water, and Ice** moves.

In its Gigantamax state, its Water-type attacks transform into **G-Max Cannonade**, which traps and damages opponents for four turns.

## Evolution & Biology
Blastoise is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Squirtle**, which evolves into **Wartortle** starting at Level 16. The final evolution into **Blastoise** occurs at Level 36. The transition to **Gigantamax Blastoise** is not a standard evolution but a temporary transformation triggered by the Dynamax phenomenon in specific locations, provided the Blastoise has the Gigantamax factor (often granted by drinking Max Soup). Biologically, it is a member of the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups. It is a slow-growing species with a blue, upright physiology and a heavy, armored shell that serves as its primary means of both defense and offense.
