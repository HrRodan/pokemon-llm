## Identity & Lore
Duraludon (Pokedex #884) is the Alloy Pokémon, a towering bipedal creature composed of an incredibly durable organic metal. First discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII, its body resembles a polished skyscraper, reflecting its habitat in mountainous and urban areas where it frequently clashes with Tyranitar for territory. Despite its massive appearance, Duraludon's metallic hide is uniquely lightweight, allowing it to move with surprising agility, though it must constantly remain vigilant as its specialized skin is prone to corrosion and rusting. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or a Paradox form, Duraludon is famous for its **Gigantamax form**, which transforms it into a literal sentient skyscraper capable of unleashing the devastating G-Max Depletion move.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Light Metal:** Halves the Pokémon's weight; useful for reducing damage from moves like Low Kick or Grass Knot.
    * **Heavy Metal:** Doubles the Pokémon's weight; significantly increases the power of its **Heavy Slam** move.
    * **Stalwart (Hidden):** A premier competitive ability that allows Duraludon's moves to ignore the effects of "redirection" abilities and moves (like Follow Me or Rage Powder), making it a top-tier threat in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Duraludon is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. Originally thought to be a standalone species in the Galar region, recent discoveries in the Blueberry Academy Terarium have revealed that it **evolves into Archaludon** when exposed to a **Metal Alloy**. This evolution significantly enhances its bulk and grants it the signature move Electro Shot. 

Biologically, Duraludon belongs to the **Mineral and Dragon** Egg Groups. It has a Hatch Counter of 30, making it a relatively difficult Pokémon to breed. Its "upright" shape and white color palette are indicative of its sleek, modern aesthetic, and its high Defense stat reflects the rigid, structural integrity of its alloy-based cells.
