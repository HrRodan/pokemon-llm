## Identity & Lore
Elekid (Pokedex #239) is the **Electric Pokémon** introduced in Generation II (Johto). This small, humanoid Pokémon is characterized by its yellow and black coloring and the distinct plug-like antennae on its head. Biologically, Elekid generates electricity by violently rotating its arms; however, as a Baby Pokémon, it tires easily and can only charge a small amount at a time. It inhabits grasslands where thunderstorms are frequent. Elekid is the first stage of a powerful evolutionary line that includes the formidable **Electivire**.

## Evolution & Biology
Elekid is a "Baby" Pokémon and the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Electabuzz** starting at **Level 30**. Subsequently, Electabuzz evolves into **Electivire** when traded while holding an **Electirizer**. As a Baby Pokémon, Elekid belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) group and cannot breed itself, but it is hatched from eggs produced by its evolved forms. In the wild, Elekid may occasionally be found holding an Electirizer.
