## Identity & Lore
Cinderace-Gmax (Pokedex #10210) is the Striker Pokémon, a towering Gigantamax manifestation of the Fire-type starter from Generation VIII (Galar). Standing at an immense height of 27 meters, it no longer stands on the ground but instead balances atop a massive, sentient fireball that can grow to gargantuan proportions. This fireball is infused with Cinderace's burning fighting spirit and possesses a will of its own, autonomously pursuing targets. Cinderace-Gmax is the pinnacle of the Scorbunny line's athletic evolution, utilizing its incredible leg strength to deliver kicks that carry the force of a meteor impact. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, this Gigantamax state allows it to use the exclusive move **G-Max Fireball**, which ignores the target's Ability.

* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fire-type, it is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Water**. It **resists Fire, Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Maximizing its high Attack and elite Speed tier, Cinderace-Gmax thrives with its signature **Pyro Ball**, which deals massive physical fire damage.

* **Abilities:** **Blaze** powers up Fire-type moves by 50% when Cinderace's health drops below one-third. Its Hidden Ability, **Libero**, is its most competitive asset, changing the Pokémon's type to the type of the move it is about to use, ensuring every attack benefits from a Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB).

## Evolution & Biology
Cinderace-Gmax is the final form of a three-stage evolutionary line originating in the Galar region. It begins its life as **Scorbunny**, which evolves into the brooding **Raboot** upon reaching Level 16. The line reaches its maturity when Raboot evolves into **Cinderace** at Level 35. The specific Gigantamax form is achieved only by Cinderace individuals possessing the G-Max Factor, a trait that can be unlocked by consuming Max Soup. Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups and has a hatch counter of 20. It is a highly disciplined Pokémon that juggles pebbles with its feet, transforming them into blazing projectiles through intense heat and friction generated by its internal flame sac.
