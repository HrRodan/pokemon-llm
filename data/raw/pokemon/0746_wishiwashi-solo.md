## Identity & Lore
Wishiwashi (Pokedex #746) is known as the Small Fry Pokémon and was first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. In its Solo Form, it appears as a tiny, vulnerable blue fish weighing only 0.3kg. However, its biological defense mechanism is one of the most remarkable in the Pokémon world; when threatened, Wishiwashi’s eyes moisten and begin to shine, emitting a light that signals its comrades. This distress call summons a massive collective of Wishiwashi to unite into its "School Form," a transformation so terrifying that even Gyarados are known to flee from it. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique ability to aggregate into a sea-monster-like entity serves a similar purpose, effectively turning a fragile individual into a powerhouse of the deep.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 20, Defense 20, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 25, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Form-Dependent Tactical Pivot. In its Solo Form, Wishiwashi has some of the lowest base stats of any Pokémon, but it is designed to function as a "magnum opus" of form-shifting mechanics.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** types. 
* **Move Selection:** Despite its low Solo stats, Wishiwashi has access to a high-tier movepool that it utilizes once its Ability activates. Key moves include **Scald** (for STAB damage and burn utility), **Ice Beam** (for Grass-type coverage), **Hydro Pump** (for maximum burst damage), and **Flip Turn** or **U-turn** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups or when its HP drops too low to maintain its form).
* **Abilities:** Schooling (This is Wishiwashi's signature ability. As long as Wishiwashi is at least Level 20 and its HP is above 25%, it will transform into its massive School Form at the start of a turn or upon switching in. If its HP falls below the 25% threshold, it reverts to this vulnerable Solo Form).

## Evolution & Biology
Wishiwashi is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve into or from any other species. Instead, it relies entirely on its **Schooling** mechanic to change its combat efficacy. Biologically, it is a member of the **Water 2** Egg Group, sharing a category with other fish-like Pokémon. Its growth rate is "Fast," allowing it to reach the Level 20 requirement for its School Form relatively quickly. Despite its small size, its collective behavior allows it to dominate ocean ecosystems in the Alola region, where it is treated with much more respect than its "Small Fry" moniker would suggest.
