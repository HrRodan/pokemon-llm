## Identity & Lore
Cofagrigus (Pokedex #563) is the Coffin Pokémon, a formidable Ghost-type spirit first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Encased in a sarcophagus of gleaming gold, Cofagrigus is often found haunting ancient ruins and tombs. Lore states that this Pokémon punishes grave robbers by swallowing them and turning their bodies into mummies; it is also known to have a refined palate, specifically seeking out and eating gold nuggets. While Cofagrigus does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it stands as the Unovan counterpart to the Galar region's Runerigus, representing a divergent path of spiritual evolution for the Yamask species.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 58, Attack 50, Defense 145, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 105, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Trick Room Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost and Dark** types. It **resists Bug and Poison**, and enjoys complete **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Defense and solid Special Attack, essential moves include **Shadow Ball** for reliable STAB damage, **Body Press** (which calculates damage using its 145 Defense rather than Attack), **Trick Room** to capitalize on its low Speed, and **Nasty Plot** to boost its offensive presence.
* **Abilities:** Mummy (When the user is hit by a contact move, the attacker's ability is changed to Mummy. This is a powerful tactical tool for neutralizing top-tier abilities like Intimidate, Tough Claws, or Libero).

## Evolution & Biology
Cofagrigus is the second and final stage of its evolutionary line. It evolves from Yamask starting at Level 34. While the Unovan Yamask evolves into this golden sarcophagus, the Galarian variant follows a different path into Runerigus. Cofagrigus is part of the Mineral and Indeterminate Egg Groups. Biologically, it is noted for its four spectral, shadow-like arms that emerge from its golden body to manipulate objects or ensnare foes. Despite its heavy appearance, it weighs 76.5 kg and is capable of utilizing various "room" moves (Trick Room, Wonder Room) to warp the battlefield to its advantage.
