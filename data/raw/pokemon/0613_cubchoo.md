## Identity & Lore
Cubchoo (Pokedex #613) is the Chill Pokémon, a small, bipedal ursine creature first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Primarily white in color with a light blue head, Cubchoo is most distinguished by the constant drip of light blue mucus hanging from its nose. This snot is not merely a sign of a cold; it is the source of its power. When healthy, its mucus is sticky and provides the raw material for its Ice-type attacks, but if Cubchoo falls ill, the mucus becomes watery, significantly weakening its freezing capabilities. It is typically found in cold, snowy habitats like mountains or frozen tundras. While Cubchoo does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its evolved form, Beartic, is a powerhouse in frozen environments.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 70, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 40, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Physical Weather Attacker. While its base speed is low, it serves as a potent threat in Snow-based teams due to its abilities.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ice-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, and Fire**. It lacks a double weakness (4x) but possesses a single resistance to **Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Cubchoo's physical Attack is its strongest offensive asset. Key moves that capitalize on this stat include **Ice Punch** (reliable STAB), **Play Rough** (strong Fairy-type coverage), **Superpower** (high-damage Fighting-type move), and **Icicle Spear** (multi-hit STAB to break through Substitutes or Focus Sashes). It can also utilize **Liquidation** for additional coverage against Fire-types.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Snow Cloak:** Increases evasion during a hailstorm or snow, making it harder to hit. 
    * **Slush Rush:** Doubles its Speed stat during snow, transforming it from a slow cub into a surprisingly fast threat. 
    * **Rattled (Hidden):** Boosts Speed when hit by Bug, Ghost, or Dark-type moves, or if intimidated.

## Evolution & Biology
Cubchoo is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Beartic** once it reaches **Level 37**. This evolution marks a significant shift from a small, sniffly cub into a massive, aggressive predator known for freezing its own breath to create fangs and claws of ice. Cubchoo belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, suggesting a moderate breeding cycle. In the wild, they are often seen inhaling their mucus to perform attacks or using it as a barometer for their own health and elemental strength.
