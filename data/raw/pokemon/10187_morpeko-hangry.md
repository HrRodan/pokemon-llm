## Identity & Lore
Morpeko-Hangry (Pokedex #10187) is the Two-Sided Pokémon, a unique species first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. While its standard "Full Belly Mode" is characterized by a relatively docile nature, the Hangry Mode is a volatile transformation triggered by constant hunger. In this state, its hormones balance shifts, turning its fur a dark purple and its disposition aggressively territorial. As it relentlessly consumes seeds stored in its pocket-like pouches, it generates a volatile electric current. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form, it is widely known as the signature Pokémon of the Spikemuth Gym Leader candidate, Marnie. Its biology is defined by a metabolic cycle that forces it into a state of perpetual foraging to manage its intense electrical output.

## Evolution & Biology
Morpeko is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It represents a unique evolutionary niche where its survival is tied to its dual-mode temperament. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Fairy** Egg Groups, making it a versatile partner for breeding high-speed physical attackers. Despite its small stature of only 0.3 meters and 3.0 kilograms, its electrical capacity is immense, fueled by its constant need to eat. Breeders note its relatively quick maturation, indicated by a hatch counter of 10.
