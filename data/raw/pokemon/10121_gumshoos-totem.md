## Identity & Lore
Totem Gumshoos (Pokedex #10121) is the Totem variant of the Stakeout Pokémon, first appearing in the Alola region during Generation VII. This specific form is significantly larger and heavier than its standard counterpart, standing 1.4 meters tall and weighing 60.0 kg. As a pure Normal-type, it is known for its incredible patience, often staking out the burrows of its prey—primarily Rattata and Raticate—for hours on end. Despite its diligent hunting nature, it is strictly diurnal and is known to fall asleep immediately at nightfall. This Totem form serves as a specialized challenge for trainers during the Island Challenge on Melemele Island, where it is shrouded in a special aura that boosts its defensive capabilities. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence is intrinsically linked to the ecosystem changes caused by the introduction of invasive species in Alola.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Stakeout:** A signature ability that doubles the damage dealt to a target that has just switched into battle, making it a terrifying presence against teams that rely on frequent pivoting.
    * **Strong Jaw:** Increases the power of biting moves (like Crunch and Hyper Fang) by 50%.

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Gumshoos is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Yungoos** once it reaches **Level 20**, but only when leveled up during the **daytime**. Biologically, it is a quadruped with a sturdy build and brown fur, characterized by a distinct yellow stripe. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. Its biology is centered around caloric conservation; it stays perfectly still while waiting for prey to minimize energy expenditure, a trait reflected in its low Speed stat but high physical power. In the wild, it is often found carrying a **Pecha Berry**, which it uses to neutralize poisoning during its long hunts.
