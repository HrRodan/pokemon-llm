## Identity & Lore
Pansear (Pokedex #513) is the High Temp Pokémon, a mammalian Fire-type species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its bright red fur and a distinctive flame-shaped tuft atop its head, this tuft serves as a barometer for its emotional state; when Pansear becomes angered, the temperature of this tuft can soar to 600° F. This biological heater is not just for defense, as Pansear is known to intelligently use its tuft to roast berries before consumption. It is one of three "Elemental Monkeys" alongside Pansage and Panpour, often provided to trainers in the Dreamyard to balance their team's elemental weaknesses. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is recognized for its versatility in early-game environments across the Unova and Kalos regions.

## Evolution & Biology
Pansear is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Simisear** when **exposed to a Fire Stone**. This evolution is non-level dependent, meaning Pansear can be evolved at any time, though trainers often delay this to ensure it learns specific utility moves first. Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground** (Field) egg group, with a hatch counter of 20, indicating a relatively standard breeding cycle. Pansear is often found in forest environments where it can easily forage for berries to roast and share with its kin.
