## Identity & Lore
Greninja (Pokedex #658) is the Ninja Pokémon, a dual-type Water and Dark species that serves as the final evolutionary form of the Kalos region's Water-type starter. First introduced in Generation VI (Kalos), this sleek, bipedal amphibian is famous for its incredible speed and grace. Its most striking physical feature is the long, pink tongue it wraps around its neck like a scarf. Greninja lives up to its classification by compressing water into sharp throwing stars, known as Water Shurikens, which are capable of slicing through solid metal when spun and thrown at high speeds. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is unique for its "Battle Bond" phenomenon, which allows it to transform into the legendary **Ash-Greninja**, a form that rivals Mega Evolutions in power.

## Evolution & Biology
Greninja is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Froakie**, which evolves into **Frogadier** starting at level 16. The transition into **Greninja** occurs upon reaching level 36. Biologically, it is a master of stealth, often disappearing into a haze of bubbles or using its immense leg strength to leap onto ceilings. It belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and is known for a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant training to reach its full potential. While it lacks a habitat in the wild in most regions, it is a prized companion for elite trainers and ninjas alike.
