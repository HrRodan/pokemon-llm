## Identity & Lore
Clobbopus (Pokedex #852) is the Tantrum Pokémon, a small but aggressive cephalopod-like creature introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). Despite its appearance and the fact that it is often found near the shoreline in environments like Route 9 or the Galar Coast, it is a pure Fighting-type rather than a Water-type. Its brown, soft body is characterized by its curiosity; however, it investigates its surroundings primarily by punching anything it encounters with its powerful tentacles. Driven by a constant search for food, Clobbopus is one of the few aquatic-themed Pokémon known to leave the water and venture onto land, using its limbs to crawl and strike. While Clobbopus itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Grapploct, is renowned in the Galar region for its wrestling-based combat style.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 68, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 32.
* **Archetype:** Low-Speed Physical Brawler. Given its stat distribution, it functions as a developmental physical attacker that relies on its decent Defense for its size to survive long enough to land a hit.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It possesses **resistances to Bug, Rock, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Attack stat and potential for ability synergy, Clobbopus excels with moves such as **Close Combat** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Sucker Punch** to compensate for its low Speed with priority, **Power-Up Punch** to boost its offensive presence, and **Liquidation** for reliable physical coverage against Fire and Ground types.
* **Abilities:** **Limber** prevents the Pokémon from being paralyzed, ensuring its already low Speed isn't further hindered. Its Hidden Ability, **Technician**, is highly valuable as it increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%, making moves like *Power-Up Punch* and *Rock Smash* significantly more threatening.

## Evolution & Biology
Clobbopus is the first stage in a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the Jujitsu-inspired Grapploct only when it **levels up while knowing the move Taunt**. This unique requirement reflects its "Tantrum" nature, transitioning from uncoordinated punching to the sophisticated grappling techniques of its evolution. Biologically, it is highly versatile in breeding, belonging to both the **Water 1** and **Human-Like** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 25 (approximately 6,400 steps). Its growth rate is medium-slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential in the competitive circuit of the Galar region.
