## Identity & Lore
Gigalith (Pokedex #526) is the Compressed Pokémon, a formidable creature originally discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Its body is composed of incredibly dense blue rock, punctuated by orange crystals that protrude from its limbs and head. These crystals act as solar energy collectors and conduits; by compressing this energy within its internal core, Gigalith can fire off blasts of such immense power that they are capable of blowing away entire mountains. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigamax form, or Paradox variant, it is often regarded as the Unovan counterpart to the Golem and Tyranitar lines due to its raw power and evolutionary methods. It is commonly found in deep caves and mountainous terrain, where it remains motionless while absorbing sunlight or preparing to unleash seismic energy.

## Combat Profile

    * **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being defeated in a single hit from full health, ensuring it can set up hazards or retaliate.

## Evolution & Biology
Gigalith is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Roggenrola**, which features a single ear-like opening. Roggenrola evolves into **Boldore** starting at **Level 25**. To reach its final form, Boldore must be **traded between trainers**, a process that triggers the final structural compression into **Gigalith**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, and it is known to be a slow-growing species with a hatch counter of 15. It is frequently found carrying items such as the **Everstone** or **Hard Stone** in the wild, reflecting its rigid, crystalline nature.
