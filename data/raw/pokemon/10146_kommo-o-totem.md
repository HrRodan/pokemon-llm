## Identity & Lore
Totem Kommo-o (Pokedex #10146) is the formidable Scaly Pokémon and represents a specialized, larger-than-average variant of the standard Kommo-o found in the Alola region (Generation VII). Residing deep within the Vast Poni Canyon, this specific Totem Pokémon serves as the final trial of the Island Challenge, radiating a powerful aura that boosts its statistics at the start of battle. Its body is covered in glittering, metallic scales that serve as both sturdy armor and a rhythmic instrument; it threatens enemies by jingling these scales to create a cacophony that sends weaker opponents into a panic. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famous for its exclusive Z-Move, **Clangorous Soulblaze**, which allows it to strike all opponents and boost its own stats simultaneously.

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Kommo-o is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this Totem variant is specifically encountered as a boss-level entity. The lineage begins with **Jangmo-o**, a small, brave warrior that lives in secluded mountains. Jangmo-o evolves into **Hakamo-o** starting at level 35, at which point it begins to dance and clash its scales together to intimidate foes. Finally, Hakamo-o evolves into **Kommo-o** at level 45. Biologically, these Pokémon are solitary and dedicated to their training, returning to their birthplace to protect younger Jangmo-o. It belongs to the **Dragon** egg group and is noted for its slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. It is often found carrying a **Razor Claw**, which boosts its critical-hit ratio in battle.
