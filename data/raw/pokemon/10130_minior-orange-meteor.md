## Identity & Lore
Orange Meteor Minior (Pokedex #10130) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique Rock/Flying-type organism that originated in the ozone layer. This specific form represents the Pokémon while its heavy, rocky outer shell is intact, protecting the "Core" within. Found throughout the Alola region (Generation VII), Minior consumes dust in the atmosphere; the composition of the dust it eats determines the color of its core, which in this instance is a vibrant orange. While in its Meteor Form, it is encased in a brown, stony crust that acts as an atmospheric shield. When this shell becomes too heavy, Minior falls from the sky toward the surface of the planet. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biological gimmick revolves entirely around the "Shields Down" transformation, which allows it to transition from a defensive bunker to a high-speed glass cannon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 100, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Setup Sweeper. In its Meteor Form, it functions as a bulky pivot that focuses on surviving hits to set up stat boosts.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Steel, Water, Electric, and Ice**. It possesses a crucial **immunity to Ground** and **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Move Selection:** Minior utilizes its defensive bulk to set up for a sweep once its shell breaks. Key moves include **Shell Smash** (to drastically boost offensive stats), **Power Gem** (primary special STAB), **Acrobatics** (doubles in power once a held White Herb is consumed), and **Earthquake** (for vital coverage against Steel and Rock types). **Meteor Beam** is also a potent option for a high-damage Rock-type nuke that further boosts Special Attack.
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The signature ability of Minior. While in Meteor Form and above 50% HP, it is immune to status conditions and boasts high defenses. When HP drops below half, the shell shatters, swapping its high defenses for massive Speed and Attack stats).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it undergoes a dramatic **Form Change** triggered by its **Shields Down** ability. In the wild, it is often found holding a **Star Piece**. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and its biological cycle is tied to the consumption of atmospheric debris. Breeding a Minior requires a Hatch Counter of 25 (approximately 6,400 steps) to produce an Egg. Despite its rocky exterior, the "Orange Meteor" designation refers to the specific internal core color that will be revealed once the shell is breached in battle.
