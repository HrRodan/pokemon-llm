## Identity & Lore
Pikachu Belle (Pokedex #10081) is the Mouse Pokémon, a unique and stylish variant of the iconic Electric-type originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). This specific form, known as Pikachu Belle, is part of the "Cosplay Pikachu" group first appearing in the Hoenn region (Generation VI) for Pokémon Contest Spectaculars. Distinguished by its elaborate blue and white Rococo-style gown and a fan-shaped tail ornament, Pikachu Belle exudes elegance and poise. According to its lore, when groups of these Pokémon congregate, they can generate enough atmospheric electricity to trigger intense lightning storms. While this specific form is known for its theatrical flair in forests and contest halls, the broader Pikachu species is famous for its evolutionary potential, including the massive Gigantamax Pikachu of the Galar region and its evolved form's Alolan variant.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 55, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Fast Glass Cannon / Physical Attacker. While its base stats are modest, its high Speed allows it to act as an effective revenge killer or disruptor, especially when equipped with its signature **Light Ball** to double its offensive power.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Electric-type, it is **weak to Ground**. It effectively **resists Flying, Steel, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Pikachu Belle is unique because it has access to moves not normally available to standard Pikachu. Capitalizing on its physical Attack and form-exclusive access, key moves include **Icicle Crash** (its signature Ice-type coverage), **Wild Charge** (powerful STAB physical damage), **Volt Switch** (for pivoting out of danger), and **Nuzzle** (for 100% accurate paralysis utility).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Static:** Has a 30% chance to paralyze any opponent that makes contact with a physical move, punishing attackers.
    * **Lightning-Rod (Hidden Ability):** Provides a complete immunity to Electric-type moves, while also boosting its Special Attack when hit by one, making it an excellent switch-in against predicted Thunderbolts.

## Evolution & Biology
Pikachu Belle is a special member of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this specific Cosplay form is unique and cannot evolve or breed. In the standard lineage, the species begins as **Pichu**, which evolves into **Pikachu** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (minimum 220). Under normal circumstances, a Pikachu can then evolve into **Raichu** when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**, or into Alolan Raichu in the Alola region. Pikachu Belle belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** Egg Groups, though it is often treated as a singular, special-event entity. Its biological makeup allows it to store electricity in its cheek pouches, which it must discharge periodically to avoid physical discomfort. In its "Belle" attire, it demonstrates a sophisticated temperament often found in high-tier Pokémon Contests.
