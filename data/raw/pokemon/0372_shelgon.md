## Identity & Lore
Shelgon (Pokedex #372) is the **Endurance Pokémon** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Characterized by its bone-white, armor-like shell, Shelgon acts as a living chrysalis or pupa for the Pseudo-Legendary Salamence line. It resides in **rough-terrain** environments, such as caves and cliffs, where it awaits its final metamorphosis. Within its heavy, spherical body, its cells are rapidly transforming, creating a new body structure capable of flight. Due to the immense weight of its protective covering (110.5 kg), Shelgon is sluggish and moves slowly, often fasting while storing energy for evolution. While it has no alternate forms itself, its final evolution possesses a powerful **Mega Evolution** and is historically linked to the Paradox Pokémon, **Roaring Moon**.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 95, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 50, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** **Physical Tank / Setup Sweeper**. With high Defense and respectable Attack, Shelgon functions well as a bulky attacker, often utilizing the **Eviolite** item (World Knowledge) to further boost its defensive capabilities before evolving.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Dragon-type**, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It possesses key resistances to **Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Attack stat (95) and access to setup moves, the optimal loadout includes **Dragon Dance** (to boost Attack and Speed), **Dragon Claw** (Reliable STAB), **Double-Edge** (High damage output), and **Zen Headbutt** or **Crunch** for coverage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage. This is strategically vital as it allows Shelgon to use high-power moves like *Double-Edge* or *Take Down* without taking damage.
    *   **Overcoat (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from weather damage (Sandstorm/Hail) and powder moves, enhancing its durability in varied environments.

## Evolution & Biology
Shelgon is the intermediate stage of a **three-stage evolutionary line**. It evolves from **Bagon** starting at **Level 30**. This state represents the period where the Pokémon gives up mobility to facilitate the growth of wings. It evolves into the Pseudo-Legendary **Salamence** starting at **Level 50**, finally achieving the flight that its pre-evolution, Bagon, instinctively desired. Shelgon belongs to the **Dragon** Egg Group and has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential.
