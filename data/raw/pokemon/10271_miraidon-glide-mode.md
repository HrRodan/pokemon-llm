## Identity & Lore
Miraidon (Pokedex #10271), specifically in its Glide Mode, is the mysterious Paradox Pokémon known as the "Iron Serpent." Encountered within the Great Crater of Paldea (Generation IX), this legendary entity is believed to be a futuristic descendant or relative of the modern-day Cyclizar. While it shares a silhouette with its contemporary counterpart, Miraidon is far more ruthless and powerful, possessing a body reinforced by advanced technology and glowing energy. In this Glide Mode, it reconfigures its mechanical physiology to navigate the skies, using its tail and throat membranes as aerodynamic surfaces. Beyond its traversal forms, Miraidon is capable of entering a high-output Ultimate Mode for intense combat. Its blue, robotic exterior and lack of biological warmth suggest a being shaped by artificial evolution in a distant timeline.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 85, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 115, Speed 135.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Terrain-Based Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides vital resistances against **Fire, Water, Grass, Flying, and Steel**, and possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Miraidon thrives by utilizing its massive Special Attack and speed. Key moves include its signature **Electro Drift** (which deals increased damage if super effective), the devastating **Draco Meteor** for immediate nuking power, **Volt Switch** for high-momentum pivoting, and **Overheat** to melt through Steel-type walls that might resist its primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Abilities:** Hadron Engine (Upon entering the battlefield, Miraidon automatically activates Electric Terrain; furthermore, while Electric Terrain is active, its Special Attack is increased by roughly 33%, making it one of the most fearsome special attackers in the history of the Paldean region).

## Evolution & Biology
Miraidon-Glide-Mode is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to a standard evolutionary chain. It is considered a Paradox Pokémon, a category of beings that defy conventional biological classification. While it bears a striking physical resemblance to Cyclizar, there is no evidence that one evolves into the other via traditional leveling or items. Biologically, it is inorganic in nature, categorized under the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. It is characterized by a "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Although it spends much of its time in traversal forms like Glide or Drive mode, its true power is only fully realized when it assumes its combat-ready stance to protect its territory or its allies.
