## Identity & Lore
Corsola (Pokedex #222) is the aquatic **Water/Rock-type** known as the **Coral Pokémon**. First discovered in the **Johto** region (Generation II), this Pokémon inhabits the warm, clean waters of southern seas. Corsola's skeletal structure is formed of pink coral that it continuously sheds and regrows; these branches are highly prized as treasures due to their distinct beauty. In the wild, Corsola congregate to form massive coral reefs that serve as homes for smaller Pokémon. It shares a hostile ecological relationship with **Mareanie** and **Toxapex**, which prey on Corsola's branches. While this profile details the standard form, a Ghost-type regional variant exists in the Galar region, known as **Galarian Corsola**, which arose from bleached coral caused by climate change.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 55, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 95, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Wall / Defensive Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual Water/Rock type, Corsola suffers a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass-type** moves. It is also weak to **Electric, Fighting, and Ground-type** attacks. However, it boasts a **Double Resistance (1/4 damage) to Fire-type** moves, and resists Normal, Flying, Poison, and Ice attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high defensive stats and utility, the optimal move set includes **Recover** for reliable longevity and **Stealth Rock** to set entry hazards. For offensive pressure with utility, **Scald** is preferred over higher damage moves due to its chance to burn physical attackers, while **Power Gem** provides consistent Rock-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Hustle:** Boosts Attack by 50% but lowers accuracy by 20% (generally suboptimal for this special-defensive build).
    *   **Natural Cure:** Heals all status conditions when the Pokémon switches out.
    *   **Regenerator (Hidden Ability):** Restores 33% of the Pokémon's maximum HP upon switching out. This is Corsola's most competitive ability, allowing it to function as a durable pivot.

## Evolution & Biology
The Corsola described here (Johtonian form) is a **single-stage** Pokémon that does not evolve. However, it is biologically linked to the **Galarian Corsola**, which evolves into **Cursola** starting at **Level 38**. This species falls under the **Water 1** and **Water 3** Egg Groups. Corsola is known for its rapid regeneration; even if its coral branches are broken off by predators or currents, they grow back overnight as long as the water remains clean and nutrient-rich.
