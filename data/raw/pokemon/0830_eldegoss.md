## Identity & Lore
Eldegoss (Pokedex #830) is the Cotton Bloom Pokémon, a distinctive Grass-type creature first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It is characterized by the massive, fluffy ball of cotton wool on its head, which is studded with tiny, nutrient-rich seeds. These seeds are highly valued in the Galar ecosystem; Eldegoss spreads them across the land via the wind, providing nourishment to both the soil and local Pokémon. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famously known as the ace Pokémon of Turffield’s Gym Leader, Milo, symbolizing the pastoral beauty and resilience of the Galar countryside. Its gentle appearance belies its hardiness, as it can withstand harsh winds while drifting across open fields.

## Evolution & Biology
Eldegoss is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Gossifleur** starting at **Level 20**. Biologically, the cotton on its head acts as both a protective cushion and a dispersal mechanism for its progeny. Its light weight (2.5 kg) allows it to travel vast distances, though its high Special Defense ensures it isn't easily grounded by elemental attacks. It belongs to the **Plant** egg group, and its growth is fueled by sunlight, often utilizing moves like **Sunny Day** and **Synthesis** to maintain its vitality in the wild.
