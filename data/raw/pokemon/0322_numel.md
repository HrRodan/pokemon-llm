## Identity & Lore
Numel (Pokedex #322) is the Numb Pokémon, a yellow, quadrupedal creature residing in the mountain regions of Generation III (Hoenn). Biologically, this Pokémon functions as a living reactor; its body is a seething cauldron of boiling magma. Numel is notoriously dull-witted and often fails to notice when it has been hit physically, yet it possesses an extreme intolerance for hunger. If its body cools down, the magma hardens, slowing its movements. While Numel does not possess alternate forms, its evolution, Camerupt, is capable of undergoing Mega Evolution.

    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming infatuated or falling for taunts.
    *   **Simple:** Doubles the effect of stat changes (e.g., one use of Growth raises offensive stats by two stages instead of one), making Numel a dangerous threat if left unchecked.
    *   **Own Tempo (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused.

## Evolution & Biology
Numel is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Camerupt** when it reaches **Level 33**. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and is occasionally found holding a Rawst Berry in the wild.
