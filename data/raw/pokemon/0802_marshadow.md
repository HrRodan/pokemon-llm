## Identity & Lore
Marshadow (Pokedex #802) is the Gloomdweller Pokémon, a rare Mythical entity first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This gray, humanoid Pokémon is shrouded in mystery, possessing the unique ability to sink into the shadows of others to copy their movements and power. Because it conceals itself so effectively and never appears before humans, its very existence was long considered a myth by researchers. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Marshadow enters its "Zenith Form" when unleashing its full power or utilizing its signature Z-Move, **Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike**, causing its body to flare with green and yellow spirit energy.

* **Move Selection:** Marshadow excels by utilizing its high Attack and Speed to disrupt opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Marshadow is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. It is a member of the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is famous for its "cowardly" yet tactical nature, preferring to observe the world from the safety of a shadow rather than engaging in direct sunlight. Its unique Fighting/Ghost typing provides it with nearly unresisted offensive coverage, making it one of the most dangerous combatants in the Alolan Pokédex.
