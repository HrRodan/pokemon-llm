## Identity & Lore
Applin (Pokedex #840) is the Apple Core Pokémon, a dual-type Grass and Dragon creature first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. Characterized by its diminutive size and green coloration, Applin is unique in that its physical form is largely a mystery; it spends its entire life burrowed inside an apple. This behavior is a survival mechanism to evade its natural predators, bird Pokémon, by camouflaging itself as a simple piece of fruit. While it appears unassuming, Applin possesses immense evolutionary potential. Depending on the specific variety of apple it consumes, it can undergo radical transformations into powerful draconic forms. Notably, its evolutions Flapple and Appletun are capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, where they share a deceptive, identical appearance of a giant, nectar-filled apple. Recently discovered records from the Paldea region and Kitakami also link Applin to the evolutions Dipplin and the multi-headed Hydrapple.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 40, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 40, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank (Eviolite Support). In its unevolved state, its only standout feature is its physical Defense, making it a niche defensive pivot in Little Cup formats when holding an Eviolite.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, Dragon, and Fairy**. It has a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. Conversely, it is highly resistant to **Ground, Rock, Water (4x), Grass (4x), and Electric (4x)**.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its low offensive stats, it can utilize high-impact moves. Key selections include **Draco Meteor** for massive burst damage, **Grassy Glide** for priority in Grassy Terrain, **Sucker Punch** to circumvent its abysmal Speed, and **Recycle** to sustain itself by reusing berries.
* **Abilities:** **Ripen** (doubles the effect of held berries, such as ripening a Sitrus Berry to restore 50% HP); **Gluttony** (causes the Pokémon to consume a held berry earlier than usual); **Bulletproof** (Hidden Ability that grants total immunity to "ball" and "bomb" moves like Shadow Ball or Sludge Bomb).

## Evolution & Biology
Applin is part of a complex, branching evolutionary line. It is a unique specimen in the **Plant** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. Its evolution is entirely dependent on external items rather than leveling:
* It evolves into **Flapple** when exposed to a **Tart Apple**.
* It evolves into **Appletun** when exposed to a **Sweet Apple**.
* It evolves into **Dipplin** when exposed to a **Syrupy Apple** (found in Kitakami). Dipplin further evolves into the seven-headed **Hydrapple** after being leveled up while knowing the move **Dragon Cheer**.

Biologically, it is a slow-growing creature (Slow-to-Very-Fast growth rate) that relies on its shell for protection. It weighs a mere 0.5kg, the majority of which is the weight of the apple it inhabits.
