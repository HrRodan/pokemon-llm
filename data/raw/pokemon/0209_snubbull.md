## Identity & Lore
Snubbull (Pokedex #209) is the Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). While originally classified as a Normal-type prior to Generation VI, it is now a pure Fairy-type known for its misleading appearance. Despite its bulldog-like visage, prominent fangs, and intimidating expression, Snubbull is actually timid, affectionate, and playful. It is commonly found in urban areas and is noted for being a popular companion among women due to its hidden kindness. Its "scary" face is a biological defense mechanism used to ward off potential threats so it can avoid conflict. Snubbull does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

## Evolution & Biology
Snubbull is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Granbull** when **leveled up to Level 23**. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. While it has a fast growth rate, its low speed requires Trainers to utilize its bulk and typing effectively during battle.
