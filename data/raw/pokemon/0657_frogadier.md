## Identity & Lore
Frogadier (Pokedex #657) is the Bubble Frog Pokémon, a sleek and agile bipedal amphibian introduced in Generation VI (Kalos). This blue-colored Pokémon is distinguished by its incredible dexterity and the thick muffler of white "Frubbles" around its neck, which it uses to sense its surroundings and distract foes. As a specialized projectile combatant, Frogadier can launch bubble-covered pebbles with such precision that it can strike a target from over one hundred feet away. Its biology reflects a transition into a master of stealth, evolving from the diminutive Froakie into a creature capable of scaling ceilings and trees with ease. While Frogadier is a powerful mid-stage Pokémon, it eventually reaches its pinnacle as Greninja, a Pokémon known for its diverse forms, including the legendary Battle Bond "Ash-Greninja" and its formidable Gigantamax potential in specific regional contexts.

## Evolution & Biology
Frogadier is the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Froakie** starting at **Level 16** and undergoes its final transformation into **Greninja** once it reaches **Level 36**. Biologically, Frogadier is highly adapted to aquatic and terrestrial hunting, utilizing its long tongue and agile limbs to outmaneuver prey. It belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group, and with a hatch counter of 20, it requires significant effort to breed for competitive play. Its growth rate is "Medium-Slow," reflecting the disciplined training required to master its ninja-like combat style. While it lacks a habitat designation in modern data, it is traditionally associated with the lush wetlands and riverside forests of the Kalos region.
