## Identity & Lore
Relicanth (Pokedex #369) is the Longevity Pokémon, a rare piscine species introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Recognized as a "living fossil," this ancient Pokémon has existed for over one hundred million years without changing its form, surviving deep within the sea using its toothless mouth to filter-feed on microscopic organisms. Its gray, rock-like scales and fatty body allow it to withstand the immense pressure of the ocean depths. Relicanth is famously associated with the hunt for the Regi titans in the Hoenn region, serving as a key to unlocking the Sealed Chamber.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 90, Defense 130, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 65, Speed 55.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Recoil Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual Water/Rock type, Relicanth possesses a **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass** moves. It is also weak to Electric, Fighting, and Ground types. However, it strongly resists Fire (4x), as well as Normal, Flying, Poison, and Ice types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Defense and respectable Attack, Relicanth's optimal kit utilizes **Head Smash** (massive STAB damage), **Liquidation** (consistent Water STAB), **Earthquake** (coverage against Electric types), and **Yawn** or **Stealth Rock** (utility).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat in rain, allowing it to function as a bulky sweeper in weather teams.
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage. This is strategically vital as it allows Relicanth to use *Head Smash* without taking damage.
    *   **Sturdy (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP.

## Evolution & Biology
Relicanth is a standalone species and does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 2** Egg Groups. Biologically, it is unique for its incredibly slow growth rate and high Hatch Counter (40 cycles), reflecting its status as an ancient creature that operates on a different geological timescale than modern species.
