## Identity & Lore
Glameow (Pokedex #431) is the Catty Pokémon, a Normal-type creature introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Recognized by its sleek, gray fur and spiraled tail, this Pokémon is infamous for its fickle and temperamental nature; it tends to purr when affectionate but will ruthlessly claw its trainer if displeased. Glameow captures the hearts of trainers who appreciate its capriciousness. While it does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is well-known in Sinnoh lore as a signature Pokémon used by Team Galactic Commander Mars.
