## Identity & Lore
Copperajah (Pokedex #879) is the Copperderm Pokémon, a massive quadrupedal creature first introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). While prominent in Galar, lore suggests they originally migrated from another region long ago to work alongside humans in industrial and construction capacities. Its distinctive green coloration is a result of its skin oxidizing over time, a chemical property that grants it a unique resistance to water. Standing at 3 meters tall and weighing 650kg, it is a physical powerhouse known for its trunk, which is strong enough to crush large boulders into powder. Beyond its standard form, Copperajah is capable of **Gigantamaxing**, a transformation that allows it to stand on its hind legs and use its massive trunk to level mountains.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 122, Attack 130, Defense 69, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 69, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Wallbreaker. With a massive HP pool and elite Attack, Copperajah functions best as a tanky offensive presence, particularly in Trick Room teams where its low Speed becomes an advantage.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Steel-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ground, and Fighting**. It possesses a massive list of **resistances**, including Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy. It is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Attack and weight, key moves include **Heavy Slam** (which reaches maximum power due to its high weight), **Iron Head** (for reliable STAB and flinch chance), **Earthquake** (essential coverage for Fire and Steel types), and **Power Whip** (to surprise and destroy Water and Ground-type counters).
* **Abilities:** **Sheer Force** (increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30% at the cost of those effects, making moves like Iron Head and Play Rough devastating) and **Heavy Metal** (doubles the Pokémon's weight, further boosting the damage of weight-based moves like Heavy Slam and Heat Crash).

## Evolution & Biology
Copperajah is the second and final stage of its evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cufant** when it reaches **Level 34**. Biologically, it is a hardy creature belonging to the **Ground and Mineral** egg groups. Its physical composition is dense, and it requires significant sustenance to maintain its 650kg frame. In the Galar region, they are often found in mines or industrial areas, continuing their ancestral role as partners to human workers. While they appear slow, their sheer bulk makes them incredibly difficult to displace once they have taken a position on the battlefield.
