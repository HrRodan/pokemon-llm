## Identity & Lore
Cleffa (Pokedex #173) is the Star Shape Pokémon introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Small, pink, and possessing a distinct star-like silhouette, Cleffa is classified as a **Baby Pokémon**. Lore suggests an extraterrestrial origin; because its appearance mimics a star and it is frequently found at meteor impact sites, many believe it arrived on a meteor. Cleffa are known to be nocturnal, often spotted dancing in circles on nights filled with shooting stars to gain spiritual energy. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the pre-evolution of the formidable Clefable.
