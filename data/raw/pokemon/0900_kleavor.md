## Identity & Lore
Kleavor (Pokedex #900) is the Axe Pokémon, a powerful Bug and Rock-type creature first discovered in the ancient Hisui region (Generation VIII). This violent and formidable predator is characterized by its large, crude stone axes that have replaced the scythes of its predecessor. It fells towering trees with these stony appendages and marks its territory by carving symbols into trunks and cliffs. Its body is shielded by hard, jagged stone that provides significant physical defense. While modern eras predominantly see Scyther evolve into the metallic Scizor, Kleavor represents a divergent evolutionary path triggered by specific minerals found in the Hisuian wilderness. While Kleavor does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is recognized as a "Noble Pokémon" in Hisuian lore, possessing a special status and immense power within that era's ecosystem.

## Evolution & Biology
Kleavor is part of a split three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Scyther** when the latter is exposed to **Black Augurite**, a rare mineral found in the Hisui region. This is a distinct branch from Scyther's other evolution, **Scizor**, which occurs when traded while holding a Metal Coat. Kleavor belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a Hatch Counter of 20, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive use. Its biology is heavily influenced by the environment; the stone parts of its body frequently chip during intense battles, but the broken edges only serve to make its axe-arms sharper and more lethal. It is a brown-colored Pokémon that occupies a niche as a high-tier apex predator in rugged, mountainous habitats.
