## Identity & Lore
Dartrix (Pokedex #723) is the Blade Quill Pokémon, first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This brown, avian Pokémon is characterized by its dandyish and somewhat narcissistic personality; it is highly preoccupied with its appearance, frequently preening its plumage to maintain its pristine look. This obsession with cleanliness is a tactical double-edged sword: while Dartrix is an expert at throwing its blade-like feathers with pinpoint accuracy, it may become so distracted by dirt on its feathers that it loses focus during battle or even refuses to fight entirely. While Dartrix is primarily known to evolve into the Grass/Ghost-type Decidueye, it is notable for having a divergent evolutionary path in the ancient Hisui region, where it evolves into the Grass/Fighting-type Hisuian Decidueye.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 78, Attack 75, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 70, Speed 52.
* **Archetype:** Eviolite Bulky Attacker. With its well-rounded defensive stats and access to the Eviolite held item, Dartrix functions as a sturdy mid-evolution tank that can provide utility and chip damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, Rock, Fire, and Electric**, with a catastrophic **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. Conversely, it is immune to **Ground**, possesses a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Grass**, and resists **Fighting and Water**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its slightly higher Physical Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Leaf Blade** (high-crit STAB), **Brave Bird** (high-power Flying STAB), **Sucker Punch** (essential priority for its low Speed), and **Roost** (reliable recovery to maintain bulk).
* **Abilities:** **Overgrow** (Powers up Grass-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third). **Long Reach** (Hidden Ability: Allows the Pokémon to use contact moves without actually making contact, bypassing effects like Static, Flame Body, or Rocky Helmet).

## Evolution & Biology
Dartrix is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rowlet** starting at **Level 17**. Under normal circumstances in regions like Alola, it evolves into **Decidueye** upon reaching **Level 34**. However, if leveled up in the Hisui region, it will instead evolve into **Hisuian Decidueye**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and is known for its "Blade Quills," which are tucked inside its wings and can be launched at foes with incredible speed and curvature. Trainers must be patient with its fastidious nature, as its growth rate is **Medium-Slow**, requiring dedicated training to reach its final form.
