## Identity & Lore
Rotom-Mow (Pokedex #10012) is the Mow Form of Rotom, known as the Plasma Pokémon. First discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), this unique form manifests when the ghost-like plasma entity Rotom inhabits a lawnmower, changing its primary secondary typing from Ghost to Grass. While its base form is a mischievous spirit that haunts old chateaus, Rotom-Mow is characterized by its manic grin and a specialized motor that allows it to manipulate greenery. Its body is composed of ionized plasma, allowing it to move seamlessly through electrical wiring and infiltrate electronic devices to wreak havoc. Beyond the Mow form, Rotom is famous for its versatility, possessing the ability to shift into other appliance-based forms such as Rotom-Wash (Water), Rotom-Heat (Fire), Rotom-Frost (Ice), and Rotom-Fan (Flying). In later generations like Alola and Galar, Rotom's utility expanded into the "Rotom Dex" and "Rotom Phone," serving as an essential companion for trainers.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 65, Defense 107, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 107, Speed 86.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Pivot. With significantly higher defensive stats compared to its base form, Rotom-Mow functions as a durable utility attacker that can take hits while maintaining offensive pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Poison, Bug, and Ice**. Thanks to its ability, it possesses a complete immunity to Ground-type attacks. It **resists Steel, Water, and Grass**, and it is doubly resistant to **Electric** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Special Attack and its form-exclusive access to Grass-type offense, key moves include **Leaf Storm** (its signature high-power Grass move), **Volt Switch** (for maintaining momentum and pivoting), **Thunderbolt** (for consistent STAB damage), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to burn physical attackers and compensate for its lower HP). **Trick** is also a vital competitive option for swapping Choice items onto defensive walls.
* **Abilities:** Levitate (Gives full immunity to all Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes). This is tactically essential, as it removes what would normally be its primary weakness as an Electric-type.

## Evolution & Biology
Rotom-Mow is part of a single-stage evolutionary line, though it is biologically unique due to its **Forme Change** mechanic. It does not evolve through leveling; instead, it changes its appearance, stats, and typing when it interacts with a specific motor or appliance found in locations like Team Galactic's Eterna City HQ or the Professor's labs in other regions. In its Mow Form, it gains the move **Leaf Storm**, which it forgets if it reverts to its base form or switches to a different appliance. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** egg group (also known as the Amorphous group) and is genderless, making it only breedable with Ditto. Despite its mechanical appearance in this form, it remains a plasma-based lifeform at its core.
