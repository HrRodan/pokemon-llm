## Identity & Lore
Mega Beedrill (Pokedex #10090) is the Mega Evolved form of the Poison Bee Pokémon, a transformation achieved when a Beedrill interacts with a Beedrillite Mega Stone. Originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I), this Bug/Poison-type evolution pushes the species' predatory instincts to their absolute limit. Its appearance is defined by a sleek, aerodynamic yellow-and-black body, now sporting six stingers—four on its limbs and two on its abdomen—all of which secrete highly potent toxins. Habitually found in deep forests, Mega Beedrill is notoriously territorial and aggressive, capable of using its increased flight speed to strike targets repeatedly before they can react. While Beedrill does not possess a Gigantamax form or Paradox variant, its Mega Evolution is widely considered one of the most drastic power spikes in the Pokémon world, turning a common forest dweller into a top-tier apex predator.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 150, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 15, Sp. Def 80, Speed 145.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Glass Cannon. Mega Beedrill sacrifices almost all its defensive utility and special offensive capabilities to maximize its raw physical power and initiative.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Rock, Fire, Ground, and Psychic**. Conversely, it **resists Poison, Bug, and Fairy**, and possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x damage) to Fighting and Grass**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Attack stat and the Adaptability ability, Mega Beedrill excels with a kit focused on hit-and-run tactics and precision strikes. Key moves include **U-turn** (for high-damage scouting and pivoting), **Poison Jab** (a primary STAB move with a high poison chance), **X-Scissor** (for consistent Bug-type damage), and **Drill Run** (essential Ground-type coverage to hit Steel, Fire, and Rock types that otherwise resist its STABs).
* **Abilities:** Adaptability (Increases the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) from the standard 1.5x to 2.0x, making its Bug and Poison-type attacks hit with overwhelming force).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Beedrill is the final, temporary stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Weedle**, which evolves into the cocoon-like **Kakuna** starting at Level 7. Kakuna then evolves into the base form **Beedrill** at Level 10. The transition to Mega Beedrill occurs only during battle and requires the trainer to hold a Mega Ring while the Pokémon holds a Beedrillite. Biologically, Mega Beedrill belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, indicating a relatively fast breeding cycle. Despite its fragile 40 Defense, its 80 Sp. Def allows it to occasionally survive neutral special hits, though it is primarily designed to outspeed and knock out opponents before they can counter-attack.
