## Identity & Lore
Magnemite (Pokedex #081) is the Magnet Pokémon, a dual Electric/Steel-type entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Resembling a robotic sphere with horseshoe magnets and screws, it utilizes electromagnetic waves to defy gravity, allowing it to float through the air. This gray, mechanical creature is typically found in rough terrain or near power plants where it feeds on electrical lines. While Magnemite itself does not possess alternate forms, its evolutionary line is biologically related to the ancient Paradox Pokémon, Sandy Shocks.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 25, Attack 35, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 55, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Attacker / Little Cup Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** As an Electric/Steel type, it boasts one of the best defensive profiles in the game. It is **weak to Fire and Fighting**, and suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**. However, it is immune to Poison and **resists Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its impressive Special Attack (95), its optimal moveset includes **Thunderbolt** for reliable damage, **Flash Cannon** for Steel-type STAB, **Volt Switch** to pivot out of unfavorable matchups, and **Thunder Wave** to cripple faster opponents with paralysis. **Magnet Rise** is also a notable utility option to temporarily negate its Ground-type weakness.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Magnet Pull:** Prevents opposing Steel-type Pokémon from fleeing or switching out, allowing Magnemite to trap and eliminate them.
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing at least one turn of action.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last, synergizing well with Magnemite's naturally low speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Magnemite is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line within the Mineral Egg Group. It evolves into **Magneton** starting at **Level 30**. Magneton can subsequently evolve into the final stage, **Magnezone**, when leveled up in a special magnetic field (specific locations like Mt. Coronet or Chargestone Cave depending on the region) or when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. Uniquely, Magnemite is a genderless species.
