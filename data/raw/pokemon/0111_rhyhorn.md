## Identity & Lore
Rhyhorn (Pokedex #111) is the Spikes Pokémon, a physically robust creature originating from Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its rocky, gray hide and sharp bony protrusions, Rhyhorn prefers habitats with rough terrain where its quadrupedal frame can traverse uneven ground. It is infamous for its short-tempered behavior and "one-track mind"; lore states that once it starts charging, it cannot stop until it hits something or falls asleep, often forgetting why it started running in the first place. Its brain is notably small, making it difficult for the Pokémon to process multiple thoughts simultaneously. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the base stage of a highly prestigious evolutionary line that culminates in the formidable Rhyperior.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / NFE Wall.
* **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Ground/Rock** type, it suffers from severe **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Water and Grass** moves. It is also weak to Fighting, Ground, Ice, and Steel. However, it **resists Normal, Flying, Rock, Fire, and Poison**, and possesses a complete **immunity to Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and Defense stats, key moves include **Earthquake** (primary STAB), **Stone Edge** (secondary STAB), **Megahorn** (powerful Bug-type coverage), and **Stealth Rock** (hazard utility). **Body Press** is also viable, utilizing its high Defense for damage calculation.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Lightning Rod:** Draws in all Electric-type moves to itself to raise Special Attack; primarily grants immunity in singles.
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage, allowing the safe use of moves like Double-Edge or Take Down.
    *   **Reckless (Hidden):** Increases the power of moves that have recoil, synergizing well with Double-Edge if the user accepts the recoil damage.

## Evolution & Biology
