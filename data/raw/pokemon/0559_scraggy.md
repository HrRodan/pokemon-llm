## Identity & Lore
Scraggy (Pokedex #559) is the Shedding Pokémon, first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its yellow, reptilian appearance and its peculiar habit of pulling its loose, rubbery skin up to its neck, it uses this elastic hide like a defensive garment to minimize damage from attackers. This skin is actually a byproduct of its shedding process and gives Scraggy its distinct "hoodie" or "baggy pants" silhouette. Known for being extremely proud of its sturdy skull, Scraggy is an aggressive brawler that will suddenly headbutt anyone who makes eye contact. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its evolved form, Scrafty, is a staple of urban environments, often leading small groups in territorial disputes.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 75, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 70, Speed 48.
* **Archetype:** Physical Bulk Attacker / Setup Sweeper. In competitive "Little Cup" formats, Scraggy is a premier threat when holding an Eviolite to boost its respectable defensive stats.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting and Flying**, and suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Rock, Ghost, and Dark**, and possesses a total **immunity to Psychic** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior physical prowess over its negligible Special Attack, Scraggy excels with a kit including **High Jump Kick** for massive STAB damage, **Crunch** for reliable Dark-type offense, **Drain Punch** for health sustain, and **Dragon Dance** to patch up its low Speed while boosting its power.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Shed Skin:** Provides a 30% chance to cure status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep) at the end of each turn, granting it great longevity.
    * **Moxie:** Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat by one stage every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to snowball into a dangerous sweeper.
    * **Intimidate (Hidden Ability):** Immediately lowers the Attack stat of opposing Pokémon upon entering the battlefield, significantly enhancing Scraggy's physical bulk.

## Evolution & Biology
Scraggy is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Scrafty when it reaches **Level 39**, at which point its skin becomes even more durable and its crest grows into a more prominent "mohawk." Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground (Field) and Dragon** Egg Groups, making it a unique bridge for breeding moves like Dragon Dance onto other species. It has a hatch counter of 15, and in the wild, it is often found carrying a **Shed Shell**, which allows it to escape from trapping moves or abilities.
