## Identity & Lore
Venomoth (Pokedex #049) is the Poison Moth Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Poison creature originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This nocturnal predator inhabits dense forests, recognizable by the toxic, dust-like scales that cover its purple wings. According to biological research, these scales are color-coded: darker scales scatter paralysis-inducing toxins, while lighter scales spread poison capable of inducing sleep or inflicting damage. Venomoth is known to hunt by scattering these scales to incapacitate prey before feeding. It is attracted to light at night, a behavior that often draws it near human settlements. While it possesses no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is historically significant as a fully evolved Kanto native associated with the likes of Koga and the Elite Four.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 65, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 75, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Quiver Dance Sweeper / Baton Pass Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Bug/Poison type, it is **weak to Fire, Flying, Psychic, and Rock**. It possesses significant defensive utility with **Double Resistances (1/4x damage) to Fighting and Grass**, as well as standard resistances to Poison, Bug, and Fairy.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its solid Speed and Special Attack, its most viable competitive set utilizes **Quiver Dance** (to boost Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed simultaneously), **Bug Buzz** (Primary STAB), **Sludge Bomb** (Secondary STAB), and **Sleep Powder** (to incapacitate threats allowing for setup).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Shield Dust:** Blocks the added effects of attacks taken (e.g., prevents flinching from Fake Out or paralysis from Thunderbolt).
    *   **Tinted Lens:** The tactical choice for sweepers; it doubles the power of "not very effective" moves, allowing Venomoth to break through Steel or Ghost types that would normally wall it.
    *   **Wonder Skin (Hidden):** Makes status moves (like Taunt or Thunder Wave) more likely to miss against this Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Venomoth is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Venonat** starting at **Level 31**. There are no item requirements or trade triggers for this metamorphosis. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group. Upon evolution, its wings develop fully, transitioning from a terrestrial insectoid to an airborne predator capable of scattering toxic spores.
