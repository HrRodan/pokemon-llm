## Identity & Lore
Galarian Mr. Mime (Pokedex #10168) is the regional **Galarian Form** of the Barrier Pokémon. While the species was originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I), this specific variant emerged in the Galar region (Generation VIII), trading its Fairy-type traits for an Ice-type affinity. This blue-and-white humanoid Pokémon is a specialized performer that excels at tap-dancing on ice it creates from the soles of its feet. It is typically found in urban environments and cold climates. According to local lore, Galarian Mr. Mime is intensely focused on its craft; if interrupted while it is miming or dancing, it will aggressively slap the offender with its broad, chilled hands. While this form does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the crucial bridge to its Galar-exclusive evolution, Mr. Rime.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Mr. Mime is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Mime Jr.** when the latter is leveled up while knowing the move **Mimic**. In a departure from its Kantonian counterpart, Galarian Mr. Mime undergoes a further metamorphosis, evolving into **Mr. Rime** starting at **Level 42**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 25. Its physiology is uniquely adapted to cold, with the pads on its feet capable of freezing moisture in the air to create invisible barriers or floors for its rhythmic performances.
