## Identity & Lore
Bombirdier (Pokedex #962) is the Item Drop Pokémon, a unique Flying and Dark-type species introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This avian Pokémon is characterized by its white plumage and a distinctive "apron" formed from shed feathers attached to its chest. Bombirdier is notorious for its mischievous and sometimes dangerous behavior, as it uses this apron to gather large objects and rocks, which it then drops from extreme heights onto unsuspecting targets for amusement. While it does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or known Paradox counterparts, it gained significant notoriety in the Paldea region as the "Open Sky Titan," one of the giant Titan Pokémon guarded by Arven during the Path of Legends questline.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 103, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 85, Speed 82.
* **Archetype:** Physical Utility Attacker. With a respectable base Attack and a wide array of disruptive moves, Bombirdier functions best as a lead or a pivot that can punish opponents while maintaining momentum.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Electric, Ice, Rock, and Fairy**. It possesses valuable **immunities to Ground and Psychic**, and it **resists Grass, Ghost, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high physical Attack and unique ability synergy, key moves include **Brave Bird** for high-recoil STAB damage, **Knock Off** for item removal and utility, **Sucker Punch** for necessary priority, and **Stone Edge** or **Rock Slide** to take advantage of its signature Hidden Ability. It also excels in a support role using **Parting Shot** for pivoting and **Stealth Rock** for entry hazard setup.
* **Abilities:** Big Pecks (Prevents the Pokémon’s Defense stat from being lowered); Keen Eye (Prevents loss of accuracy and ignores the target's evasion boosts); Rocky Payload (Hidden Ability: Increases the power of Rock-type moves by 50%, effectively granting Bombirdier a third STAB-like offensive presence).

## Evolution & Biology
Bombirdier is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. Despite its solitary evolutionary status, it is a formidable member of the **Flying** egg group. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential, and is known for its relatively high base experience yield of 243. Biologically, its most fascinating feature is its feather apron; the strength of these shed feathers allows it to carry heavy loads, including boulders and occasionally smaller Pokémon, which it utilizes both for hunting and territorial defense.
