## Identity & Lore
Breloom (Pokedex #286) is the **Mushroom Pokémon** indigenous to the **Hoenn** region (Generation III). Primarily dwelling in **forest** habitats, this Grass/Fighting-type combines the biology of fungi with the agility of a kangaroo. Its appearance is characterized by the large, green mushroom cap on its head and its springy, bipedal stance. According to lore, Breloom is a deceptive fighter; it closes in on foes with sprightly, light footwork before unleashing a flurry of punches using its elastic, stretchy arms. Its boxing technique is highly refined, said to put even professional human boxers to shame. The seeds on its tail are made of hardened toxic spores, which it scatters to weaken opponents if they attempt to eat them.
