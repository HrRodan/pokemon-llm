## Identity & Lore
Mega Camerupt (Pokedex #10087) is the Mega Evolved form of the Eruption Pokémon, a transformation achieved when a Camerupt focuses its bond with its trainer through a Cameruptite Mega Stone. Originally discovered in the Hoenn region of Generation III, this red, quadrupedal Pokémon is a living volcano. Its body contains a constant flow of magma reaching temperatures of 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit, which is periodically expelled through the massive, chimney-like humps on its back. In its Mega Evolved state, the humps merge into one large, active crater, and its fur grows long, covering its legs and giving it a more formidable, tank-like appearance. While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution represents the peak of its volcanic power, transforming it into a slow-moving but devastating force of nature that thrives in mountainous volcanic habitats.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 120, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 145, Sp. Def 105, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Trick Room Special Tank / Wallbreaker. With an abysmal Speed of 20, Mega Camerupt is designed to dominate under the effects of Trick Room, where its massive Special Attack can be exerted before the opponent can react.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a Fire/Ground type, resulting in a **Double Weakness (4x) to Water** and a standard weakness to **Ground**. Conversely, it is **immune to Electric** and provides resistances to **Fire, Poison, Steel, Bug, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Mega Camerupt excels by utilizing its astronomical Special Attack and its ability to power up moves with secondary effects. Key moves include **Eruption** (for massive full-HP damage), **Earth Power** (benefiting from Sheer Force), **Fire Blast** (high-power STAB), and **Flash Cannon** (for coverage against Rock and Fairy types). It can also utilize **Stealth Rock** or **Will-O-Wisp** for utility.
* **Abilities:** Sheer Force (This ability increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, but removes those secondary effects, such as the chance to burn or lower stats. This makes moves like Earth Power and Flamethrower exceptionally lethal).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Camerupt is the final stage of a three-step progression. It begins its life as **Numel**, a dim-witted but sturdy Pokémon that stores energy in its single hump. Numel evolves into **Camerupt** upon reaching **Level 33**. The transition to **Mega Camerupt** is a temporary combat state triggered by the presence of a Mega Stone. Biologically, it is a member of the **Ground** Egg Group, and its reproductive cycle is characterized by a Hatch Counter of 20. Despite its slow movement, its internal temperature makes it a dangerous predator and a cornerstone of volcanic ecosystems, often found alongside other heat-loving species in mountain biomes.
