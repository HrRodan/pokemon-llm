## Identity & Lore
Mega Chesnaught (Pokedex #10292) is the Spiny Armor Pokémon, a massive and formidable evolution of the Generation VI (Kalos) Grass-type starter. This specific form represents a Mega Evolution of Chesnaught, pushing its defensive capabilities to an extreme level. Its body is encased in a shell so durable it can withstand massive explosions, and its physical strength is legendary—its Tackle is forceful enough to flip a 50-ton tank. Renowned for its protective nature, Mega Chesnaught acts as a living shield, using its armored limbs to protect allies from harm. While Chesnaught does not currently possess a Mega Evolution in the core series games, this form represents a significant power peak in the Kalos region's evolutionary lore, similar to the Gigantamax forms found in Galar or the Paradox forms of Paldea.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Chesnaught is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line originating in the Kalos region. It begins as **Chespin**, which evolves into **Quilladin** starting at Level 16. The line reaches its standard final form, **Chesnaught**, at Level 36. The transition to Mega Chesnaught is triggered through the use of a specific Mega Stone in battle, momentarily unlocking its dormant potential. Biologically, it is a mammalian Pokémon with a rigid, armor-like shell and belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. It follows a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential.
