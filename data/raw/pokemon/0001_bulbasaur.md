## Identity & Lore
Bulbasaur (Pokedex #001) is the iconic Grass/Poison-type **Seed Pokémon** introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Distinguished by the strange plant bulb planted on its back at birth, this creature shares a symbiotic relationship with the seed, which sprouts and grows alongside the Pokémon. Native to fresh **grasslands**, Bulbasaur captures the sun's rays to photosynthesize energy, often seen napping in bright sunlight to fuel the growth of its bulb. While it does not possess alternate forms in this stage, its final evolution, Venusaur, is capable of both **Mega Evolution** and **Gigantamaxing**, making Bulbasaur the foundation of a powerful lineage.

## Evolution & Biology

It eventually reaches its final form, **Venusaur**, starting at **Level 32**. Bulbasaur belongs to the **Monster** and **Plant** Egg Groups, requiring approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch.
