## Identity & Lore
Watchog (Pokedex #505) is the Lookout Pokémon introduced in Generation V (Unova). Resembling a meerkat or prairie dog, this Normal-type Pokémon is characterized by the luminescent patterns on its body, which act as warning signals to its pack. According to its bio, Watchog is highly vigilant; upon spotting an enemy, it stands upright with its tail high and attacks by spitting seeds from berries stored in its cheek pouches. Its design draws thematic inspiration from road workers or crossing guards, emphasized by the reflective stripes on its fur. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is a staple encounter in the Unova region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 85, Defense 69, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 69, Speed 77.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Utility / Disrupter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a critical **immunity to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Watchog functions best when utilizing its Attack stat and disruption moves to cripple opponents. An optimal moveset includes **Return** (for reliable STAB damage), **Knock Off** (to remove enemy items), **Low Kick** (for coverage against Rock and Steel types), and **Super Fang** (to cut the target's HP in half regardless of defenses).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Illuminate:** Increases the likelihood of meeting wild Pokémon (primarily an out-of-battle effect).
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents the Pokémon's accuracy from being lowered and ignores the target's evasion stages.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden Ability):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last, allowing Watchog to deal surprising damage if it is outsped or the opponent switches.

## Evolution & Biology
Watchog is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Patrat** starting at **Level 20**. This evolution is purely level-based and requires no specific items or time of day. Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground** (often referred to as Field) Egg Group. Its capture rate is relatively high, and it has a medium growth rate, making it an accessible companion for trainers early in their journey.
