## Identity & Lore
Alolan Raticate (Pokedex #10092) is the Alolan Form of the classic Mouse Pokémon, a regional variant introduced in Generation VII (Alola). Unlike its Kanto counterpart, this version adapted to an urban, nocturnal lifestyle after being driven out of its original habitats by Yungoos. It is distinguished by its dark, obsidian fur and significantly larger, puffy cheeks, which it uses to store high-calorie food gathered by its subordinate Rattata. This Pokémon is often seen leading nests and acts as a "boss" in the Alolan ecosystem; in *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, it notably serves as the Totem Pokémon of Verdant Cavern in *Pokémon Moon*. Its whiskers are vital sensory organs used to maintain balance and navigate the darkness of Alolan cities, and its temperament is much greedier than the standard form due to its obsession with high-quality ingredients. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Totem Pokémon grants it specialized aura-based enhancements in the wild.

    * **Hustle:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% but reduces the accuracy of physical moves by 20%, turning Alolan Raticate into a high-risk, high-reward physical threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Raticate is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Alolan Rattata** when leveled up to **Level 20 specifically during the Night**. This nocturnal evolution is a requirement unique to its regional form. Biologically, it is a sturdy quadruped that thrives in grassland and urban environments. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, and researchers note a Hatch Counter of 15 (approximately 3840–4096 steps) to hatch an egg. Its diet is so refined that it is rumored that gourmet chefs in the Alola region use Alolan Raticate to help them identify the freshest and highest-quality ingredients for their restaurants.
