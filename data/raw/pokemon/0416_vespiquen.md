## Identity & Lore
Vespiquen (Pokédex #416) is the Beehive Pokémon, a regal and commanding Bug/Flying-type introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Visually resembling a queen bee, its large, yellow and black striped abdomen functions as a living honeycomb for its offspring. Vespiquen serves as the matriarch of the Combee, using pheromones to command them to build hives, collect honey, and defend the colony. It is a merciless protector that will not hesitate to dispatch its "grubs"—larval Pokémon housed within its body—to attack intruders. While it is capable of physical combat, it prefers to mobilize its hive to fight on its behalf using specific command-based moves.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 80, Defense 102, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 102, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Defensive Tank / Staller.
*   **Type Matchups:** It possesses a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock-type** attacks (making it highly vulnerable to Stealth Rock). It is also weak to Fire, Electric, Ice, and Flying. However, it boasts **Double Resistances (0.25x) to Grass and Fighting**, standard resistance to Bug, and an immunity to Ground.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high defenses and signature command moves, its optimal kit includes **Attack Order** (high-crit Physical STAB), **Defend Order** (boosts Defense and Sp. Def), **Roost** (reliable recovery to sustain its bulk), and **Toxic Spikes** (hazard setting for attrition).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** The Pokémon raises the foe's PP usage, which synergizes well with Vespiquen's defensive, stalling playstyle.
    *   **Unnerve (Hidden):** Makes the opponent nervous and unable to eat Berries.

## Evolution & Biology
Vespiquen is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Combee** starting at **Level 21**, but strictly only if the Combee is **Female**. Male Combee cannot evolve. In the wild, Vespiquen may occasionally carry a **Poison Barb**. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and possesses a distinct hierarchy where it raises its young on honey collected by its subjects.
