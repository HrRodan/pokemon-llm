## Identity & Lore
Beldum (Pokedex #374) is the Steel/Psychic-type Iron Ball Pokémon introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. A unique, mechanical lifeform, Beldum lacks blood and is instead powered by a magnetic force coursing through its body. This magnetism allows it to levitate and communicate with its kin through controlled magnetic pulses. It is primarily found in **rough terrain** and possesses a distinctive robotic, blue, blob-like shape. Beldum is the first stage of a "Pseudo-Legendary" line; while it does not change form itself, its final evolution, **Metagross**, is capable of **Mega Evolution**.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 55, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 60, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / LC Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Steel/Psychic type, it provides distinct defensive utility. It is **weak to Ground, Fire, Ghost, and Dark** type moves. However, it boasts an **Immunity to Poison** and impressive resistances to **Normal, Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Defense and higher Attack stat (55), its optimal moveset includes **Iron Head** and **Zen Headbutt** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Take Down** (its signature recoil move), and **Iron Defense** to bolster its already high durability.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Clear Body:** Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats, ensuring its Attack and Defense remain consistent.
    *   **Light Metal (Hidden):** Halves the Pokémon's weight, reducing damage taken from weight-dependent moves like Low Kick or Grass Knot.

## Evolution & Biology
Beldum is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line that represents the merging of magnetic intelligence. It evolves into **Metang** starting at **Level 20** (formed by two Beldum fusing). Metang subsequently evolves into the supercomputer-like **Metagross** starting at **Level 45**. Beldum belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and is notorious for having an exceptionally low capture rate of 3, equivalent to many Legendary Pokémon. It occasionally holds a **Metal Coat** in the wild.
