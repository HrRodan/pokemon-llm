## Identity & Lore
Thundurus Incarnate (Pokedex #642) is the Bolt Strike Pokémon, a legendary avian-humanoid entity that first descended upon the Unova region in Generation V. As a member of the Forces of Nature—alongside Tornadus, Landorus, and later Enamorus—Thundurus is a chaotic deity of the skies known for flying across the land, firing bolts of lightning from the spiked tail that serves as its conductor. Its presence is marked by devastating thunderstorms, leaving a trail of charred landscapes in its wake. While this specific profile covers its blue-skinned Incarnate Forme, Thundurus is capable of transforming into its beast-like **Therian Forme** when exposed to the Reveal Glass, shifting its power from tactical disruption to raw special destructive force.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 79, Attack 115, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 80, Speed 111.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Offensive Utility.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice and Rock**. Due to its dual Electric/Flying typing, it **resists Fighting, Flying, Bug, Steel, and Grass**, and possesses a vital **Immunity to Ground**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Special Attack and Speed, Thundurus excels with high-voltage offense and tactical coverage. Key moves include **Thunderbolt** for reliable STAB damage, **Wildbolt-Storm** for a powerful signature area-of-effect strike, **Focus Blast** to dismantle Steel and Rock-type walls, and **Nasty Plot** to rapidly boost its offensive presence to overwhelming levels.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Prankster:** Grants priority (+1) to non-damaging status moves, making Thundurus an elite disruptor capable of using *Thunder Wave* or *Taunt* before the opponent can react.
    * **Defiant (Hidden Ability):** Sharply raises the Pokémon’s Attack stat when its stats are lowered by an opponent; this is particularly effective against *Intimidate* users in competitive doubles.

## Evolution & Biology
Thundurus is a legendary Pokémon and does not belong to an evolutionary line. While it does not evolve, it is biologically unique for its ability to shift between two distinct forms: the bipedal **Incarnate Forme** and the quadrupedal, dragon-like **Therian Forme**. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. In the wild, it is known as a roaming Pokémon, appearing only during fierce weather conditions. Despite its aggressive reputation for causing forest fires with its lightning, it is a crucial part of the Unovan mythos, representing the volatile power of the atmosphere.
