## Identity & Lore
Dusclops (Pokedex #356) is the spectral **Beckon Pokémon** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Residing primarily in dark **forests**, this Ghost-type is defined by its eerie, black, humanoid appearance and its terrifying biology. Its body is completely hollow, containing a void often compared to a black hole; lore states that Dusclops can absorb anything into this internal cavity, from which nothing ever returns. While it possesses hands capable of manipulating objects, its primary method of interaction is through spectral hypnosis and absorption. It is the intermediate stage of its evolutionary family, bridging the gap between a wandering spirit and a reaper of souls.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 70, Defense 130, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 130, Speed 25.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Wall / Trick Room Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ghost-type, it is **weak to Ghost and Dark**. It **resists Poison and Bug**, and possesses valuable **immunities to Normal and Fighting** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Because its offensive stats are mediocre, Dusclops excels by using fixed-damage attacks and status moves to cripple opponents. Its optimal loadout includes **Night Shade** (inflicts damage equal to level, ignoring defenses), **Will-O-Wisp** (burns physical attackers), **Pain Split** (exploits its low base HP to heal massively), and **Trick Room** (turning its abysmal Speed into a tactical advantage).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces the opponent to consume double the PP for every move used, supporting a stalling playstyle.
    *   **Frisk (Hidden):** Reveals the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing critical tactical intelligence.

## Evolution & Biology
Dusclops is the middle stage of a **3-stage evolutionary line**. It evolves from **Duskull** starting at **Level 37**. To evolve into its final form, **Dusknoir**, it must be **traded while holding a Reaper Cloth**. Dusclops belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group and is often sought after in competitive battling for its ability to utilize the **Eviolite** item, which boosts its already high Defenses by 50%.
