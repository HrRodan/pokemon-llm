## Identity & Lore
Sawsbuck (Pokedex #586) is the Season Pokémon, a majestic cervid first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). As its classification suggests, Sawsbuck is famous for its extreme physiological response to seasonal shifts, which manifests primarily in the foliage and flora growing upon its antlers. In its Spring Form, the antlers are adorned with pink flowers; the Summer Form features lush, dense greenery; the Autumn Form displays a canopy of red and orange leaves; and the Winter Form becomes stark with white, frost-like boughs. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Sawsbuck remains one of the most aesthetically diverse Pokémon in the wild. People in the Pokémon world have historically relied on Sawsbuck migrations to signal the turning of the seasons, as the leaders of the herds are the first to exhibit these botanical changes.

## Evolution & Biology
Sawsbuck is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Deerling** once it reaches **Level 34**. Biology experts note that its antlers are not merely bone, but a complex symbiotic structure that supports plant life. Interestingly, despite its plant-like attributes, Sawsbuck belongs to the **Ground** egg group. It has a hatch counter of 20, requiring a moderate amount of travel for breeders to hatch its offspring. Its behavior is highly migratory, and it is known to be slightly more aggressive and protective of its herd during the transition into its Autumn and Winter forms.
