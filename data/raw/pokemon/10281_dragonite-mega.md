## Identity & Lore
Mega Dragonite (Pokedex #10281) is the transcended state of the "Dragon Pokémon," a legendary lineage first discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). While the base Dragonite is an elusive marine Pokémon known for its human-like intelligence and kind-hearted nature—often seen rescuing drowning sailors near the water's edge—this Mega Evolved form represents a significant surge in draconic energy. Standing at 5.5 meters, it is a massive, upright brown dragon that thrives in "waters-edge" habitats. Though Dragonite does not possess a Gigantamax form or a Paradox counterpart in the Paldea region (such as Roaring Moon), its Mega Evolution solidifies its status as one of the most powerful pseudo-legendary Pokémon in existence, rivaling the sheer force of legendary titans.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 91, Attack 124, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 145, Sp. Def 125, Speed 100.
* **Archetype:** Special-Leaning Mixed Sweeper. With a massive 145 Special Attack and a solid 100 Speed tier, it functions as a potent wall-breaker that can still threaten physical damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. It is also **weak to Rock, Dragon, Fairy, and Electric**. It provides key utility by being **immune to Ground** and providing resistances to **Fighting, Fire, Water, and Bug**, with a double resistance to **Grass**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and Dragon/Flying STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), key moves include **Draco Meteor** for overwhelming burst damage, **Hurricane** for high-power aerial coverage, **Fire Blast** to incinerate Steel-type checks, and **Roost** to sustain its health during prolonged engagements.
* **Abilities:** While its standard form is renowned for **Multiscale** (which reduces damage taken when at full HP), this Mega form focuses on raw output. In tactical play, the transition to Mega Evolution is used to pivot from a defensive tank into a high-pressure offensive threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Dragonite is the final pinnacle of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Dratini**, which matures into **Dragonair** when it reaches **Level 30**. The transition to the final form occurs when Dragonair reaches **Level 55**, evolving into Dragonite. The Mega Evolution is a temporary combat state triggered by the bond between Trainer and Pokémon. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 1 and Dragon Egg Groups**, requiring a significant amount of time to reach maturity due to its **Slow growth rate** and a hatch counter of 40. Despite its bulky appearance, it is a highly aerodynamic creature capable of circling the globe in just 16 hours.
