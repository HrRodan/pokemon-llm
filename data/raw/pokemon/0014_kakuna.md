## Identity & Lore
Kakuna (Pokedex #014) is the **Cocoon Pokémon**, a transitional insectoid introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Identifiable by its yellowish, hard shell, this Pokémon remains virtually immobile, anchoring itself to trees in **forest** habitats to await evolution. While outwardly dormant, a tremendous amount of biological activity occurs beneath its exoskeleton as it reconstructs its cells to become an adult; this process generates significant heat, making the shell warm to the touch. In the wild, Kakuna relies entirely on its ability to harden its outer shell to repel predators while it prepares for its final stage. Although it lacks a Mega Evolution itself, it is the pupal stage of **Beedrill**, which is capable of Mega Evolution.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 25, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 25, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Early-Game Physical Wall / Passive Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Bug/Poison** type, it is weak to **Fire, Flying, Rock, and Psychic**. It notably possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4 damage)** to **Grass and Fighting** types, while also resisting Poison, Bug, and Fairy attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its limited move pool and transitional nature, its best options focus on survival and minor utility: **Iron Defense** (superior to Harden for boosting Defense), **Electroweb** (for Speed control), **Bug Bite** (utilizing STAB), and **String Shot**.
*   **Abilities:** **Shed Skin** (Has a 33% chance of curing any status condition such as burn, paralysis, or sleep at the end of each turn).

## Evolution & Biology
Kakuna is the intermediate stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Weedle** starting at **Level 7**. Upon reaching **Level 10**, it breaks free from its shell to evolve into **Beedrill**. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles. While in this stage, it is largely incapable of offensive maneuvers, relying on previous biological accumulation to fuel its metamorphosis.
