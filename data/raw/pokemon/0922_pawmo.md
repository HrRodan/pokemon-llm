## Identity & Lore
Pawmo (Pokedex #922) is the Mouse Pokémon, a unique dual-type Electric/Fighting creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Standing at 0.4 meters and weighing 6.5 kilograms, this bipedal Pokémon is characterized by its yellow fur and its transition from a quadrupedal stance as a Pawmi to an upright, combat-ready posture. According to Paldean records, Pawmo is known for its protective nature; when its group is threatened, it is the first to leap into battle, utilizing a specialized fighting technique that channels electric shocks through its paws. While Pawmo does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it represents a significant evolutionary step in the "Pikaclone" lineage, being the first in that category to feature a three-stage evolutionary line.

## Evolution & Biology
Pawmo is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pawmi** starting at **Level 18**. To reach its final form, **Pawmot**, the trainer must walk 1,000 steps with Pawmo outside of its Poké Ball using the "Let's Go" mechanic, and then level it up. Biologically, Pawmo belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group. Its evolution marks a physiological shift where its forepaws become more developed for discharging electricity while simultaneously delivering physical strikes, a trait further mastered upon its final evolution into Pawmot.
