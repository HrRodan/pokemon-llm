## Identity & Lore
Rillaboom (Pokedex #812) is the Drummer Pokémon, a powerful and rhythmic primate that serves as the final evolution of the Grass-type starter from the Galar region (Generation VIII). Standing over seven feet tall and weighing 90kg, this green-furred Pokémon is characterized by its stoic yet kind nature and its mastery of percussion. Rillaboom carries a special tree stump which it uses as a drum to channel its internal power; by drumming, it can control the roots of trees and plants, turning the very forest floor into a weapon. In the wild, the Rillaboom with the best drumming skills often becomes the leader of the troop. Beyond its standard form, Rillaboom has the potential to undergo **Gigantamaxing**, growing to monumental proportions and commanding a massive forest-like drum kit that allows it to unleash devastating G-Max Drum Solo attacks.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 125, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 70, Speed 85.
* **Archetype:** Physical Bulky Attacker / Terrain Setter.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 125 Attack and its signature terrain, Rillaboom excels with **Drum Beating** (which lowers the opponent's speed), **Grassy Glide** (which gains high priority in Grassy Terrain), **Wood Hammer** (for maximum damage), and **Knock Off** (to remove opponent's held items). It also frequently utilizes **Fake Out** and **U-turn** for competitive positioning and momentum.
* **Abilities:** **Overgrow** (increases the power of Grass-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third) and its highly sought-after Hidden Ability, **Grassy Surge**. Grassy Surge automatically summons Grassy Terrain upon entry, which heals all grounded Pokémon, boosts Grass-type move power, and activates the priority effect of Grassy Glide.

## Evolution & Biology
Rillaboom is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Thwackey** starting at **Level 35**, which itself evolves from the initial starter Pokémon, **Grookey**, starting at **Level 16**. Biologically, Rillaboom is a humanoid ape that maintains a symbiotic relationship with its wooden drum, which is energized by the Pokémon's own spirit. It belongs to the **Ground and Plant** Egg Groups, making it a versatile breeder. Its growth rate is medium-slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential, but its high base happiness and protective nature make it a loyal partner for any Trainer in the Galar region or beyond.
