## Identity & Lore
Linoone (Pokedex #264) is the Normal-type "Rushing Pokémon" introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Characterized by its sleek, aerodynamic body and white fur, Linoone is notorious for its inability to run in anything but a straight line. According to ecological data, it dashes at full speed to catch prey but faces significant challenges on curving roads, forcing it to make sharp, right-angle turns to evade obstacles. While this profile details the standard Hoennian form found in grasslands, a Dark/Normal regional variant exists in the Galar region. Linoone is often observed carrying items like Potions or Berries, reflecting its scavenging nature.
