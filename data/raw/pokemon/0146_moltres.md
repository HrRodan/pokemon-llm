## Identity & Lore
Moltres (Pokedex #146) is the majestic **Legendary Flame Pokémon** introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. As one of the three **Legendary Birds**—alongside Articuno and Zapdos—it represents the season of spring and is historically found in volcanic regions like Victory Road or Mt. Ember. Its plumage consists of dazzling yellow feathers, and lore states that every flap of its wings creates a brilliant flash of flames capable of extinguishing the night sky. While this profile details the original Fire/Flying form, a distinct regional variant known as **Galarian Moltres** (Dark/Flying type) resides in the Crown Tundra of the Galar region.
