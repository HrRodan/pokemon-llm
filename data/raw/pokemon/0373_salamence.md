## Identity & Lore
Salamence (Pokédex #373) is the Dragon Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This massive, blue quadrupedal draconian beast inhabits rough terrain and is renowned as a Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon due to its immense power. Its biology is a testament to the power of resolve; flavor text suggests that Salamence came about as a result of a strong, long-held dream of growing wings. This powerful desire triggered a sudden mutation in its cells, causing it to sprout magnificent red wings that allow it to fly at high speeds. While not listed in its base forms, Salamence possesses a **Mega Evolution** (Mega Salamence) fueled by the Salamencite, and shares a striking biological resemblance to the Paradox Pokémon **Roaring Moon** found in Area Zero.
