## Identity & Lore
Squirtle (Pokedex #007) is the iconic Water-type "Tiny Turtle Pokémon" introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Recognized by its light blue skin and distinct shell, it is one of the three starter Pokémon of the Kanto region. Biologically, Squirtle is defined by its defensive capabilities; shortly after birth, its back swells and hardens into a resilient shell. This shell is not merely for protection—its rounded shape and grooved surface minimize water resistance, allowing Squirtle to swim at high speeds. It prefers **waters-edge** habitats and is capable of spraying powerful foam or high-pressure water from its mouth to deter predators. While Squirtle does not possess alternate forms, its final evolution, Blastoise, is capable of both **Mega Evolution** and **Gigantamaxing**.

## Evolution & Biology
Squirtle is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Wartortle** starting at **Level 16**, which then evolves into the formidable **Blastoise** starting at **Level 36**. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, requiring approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch.
