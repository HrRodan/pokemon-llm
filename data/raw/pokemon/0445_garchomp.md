## Identity & Lore
Garchomp (Pokedex #445) is the Mach Pokémon, a pseudo-legendary Dragon/Ground-type entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its terrifying predatory efficiency, this blue, upright draconian creature resembles a hammerhead shark adapted for land. Its biology is aerodynamic, allowing it to fold its body and extend its wings to fly at sonic speeds like a jet plane, often creating shock waves that fell nearby trees. While it typically inhabits mountainous caves and arid environments, it is famous in competitive lore as the signature Pokémon of the Sinnoh Champion, Cynthia. Garchomp possesses a **Mega Evolution**, transforming into Mega Garchomp, where its arm-wings melt into massive scythes, drastically increasing its offensive power.

* **Abilities:**
    *   **Sand Veil:** Raises evasion in a sandstorm, making it difficult to hit in weather teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Garchomp is the final form of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the Monster and Dragon Egg Groups. It begins life as **Gible**, which evolves into **Gabite** upon reaching **Level 24**. The final evolution into **Garchomp** is triggered when Gabite is leveled up to **Level 48**. This evolutionary line is characterized by a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience points to reach its full potential.
