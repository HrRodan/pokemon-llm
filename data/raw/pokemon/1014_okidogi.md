## Identity & Lore
Okidogi (Pokedex #1014) is the Retainer Pokémon, a legendary figure introduced in Generation IX (Paldea) as part of the "Loyal Three" trio found in the land of Kitakami. Standing at 1.8 meters and weighing 92.2 kg, this bipedal, muscular Pokémon is characterized by its powerful physique and the distinct purple toxic chain wrapped around its neck. According to local legend, Okidogi was once a much smaller, weaker creature until the toxins from the chain stimulated its muscle growth, transforming it into the hulking brute it is today. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a "Retainer" links it narratively to the master of the trio, Pecharunt.

## Evolution & Biology
Okidogi is a legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line, meaning it does not evolve from or into any other species. It is biologically unique, categorized under the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its biology is defined by the symbiotic, yet parasitic, relationship with its toxic chain, which provides it with unnatural strength at the cost of being bound to the chain's influence. Its "Slow" growth rate reflects the immense amount of experience required to master its chemically-enhanced physical power.
