## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Toxtricity (Pokedex #10219) is the colossal Gigantamax manifestation of the Punk Pokémon, specifically occurring in its Amped Form. Hailing from the Galar region (Generation VIII), this Electric/Poison-type powerhouse is defined by its rebellious nature and rhythmic biology. In its Gigantamax state, its size swells to a staggering 24 meters, and its electrical energy creates a massive, guitar-like construct of lightning that it wields during battle. While its standard form generates electricity by clawing at the protrusions on its chest—sounding much like a bass guitar—the Gigantamax form's power is so immense that its very presence can cause the surrounding atmosphere to crackle with high-voltage sound waves. This specific form is the Amped variant, which is traditionally obtained when a Toxel with a high-energy Nature (such as Adamant, Brave, or Jolly) evolves.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 98, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 114, Sp. Def 70, Speed 75.
* **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker. While it possesses decent physical Attack, its high Special Attack makes it a premier offensive threat that utilizes sound-based moves to bypass certain defenses.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground** and is also weak to **Psychic**. Conversely, it boasts an impressive array of resistances, including **Fighting, Poison, Bug, Grass, Electric, Flying, Steel, and Fairy**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and signature ability, key moves include **Overdrive** (a sound-based Electric STAB), **Boomburst** (a high-power Normal move that ignores substitutes), **Sludge Wave** (primary Poison STAB), and **Volt Switch** for tactical pivoting. In this specific form, it utilizes the G-Max Move **G-Max Stun Shock**, which replaces Electric-type moves and inflicts either paralysis or poisoning on all opponents.
* **Abilities:** **Punk Rock** (Boosts the power of sound-based moves by 30% and halves damage taken from them), **Plus** (Increases Special Attack when a teammate has Plus or Minus), and **Technician** (Hidden Ability; increases the power of moves with 60 BP or less).

## Evolution & Biology
Toxtricity-Amped-Gmax is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Toxel** starting at **Level 30**. The specific form it takes—Amped or Low Key—is determined by the Toxel's Nature; Amped Form is triggered by Natures like Hardy, Brave, Adamant, Naughty, Docile, Impish, Lax, Hasty, Jolly, Naive, Rash, Sassy, and Quirky. The Gigantamax transformation is enabled only through the **Gigantamax Factor**, allowing it to change its appearance and access unique G-Max moves during Dynamaxing. Biologically, it belongs to the **Humanshape** egg group and is known for its relatively slow growth rate but high potential for disruption in competitive play.
