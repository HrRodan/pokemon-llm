## Identity & Lore
Paldean Aqua Breed Tauros (Pokedex #10252) is the specialized Water/Fighting-type variant of the Wild Bull Pokémon found exclusively within the Paldea region. While the species originated in Generation I (Kanto), this specific "Aqua Breed" has adapted to aquatic environments, possessing a high body fat percentage that grants it natural buoyancy and swimming capabilities. Distinguished by its darker fur and the distinct arrangement of its three tails, this Pokémon is known for its fierce temperament and overwhelming physical power. When it targets an enemy, it charges furiously while whipping its body with its long tails to propel itself through both water and land. Unlike the standard Kanto Tauros or the Paldean Combat Breed, the Aqua Breed is a rare encounter often found leading herds near Paldean lakes and shores.

## Evolution & Biology
Paldean Aqua Breed Tauros is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is a biological variant of the Kanto Tauros, representing a specialized branch of the species' lineage. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, making it a common target for competitive breeding. In the wild, it is often found in the company of other Tauros breeds, though its blue-tinted fur and specialized horn structure set it apart as the guardian of the herd's water-based territories.
