## Identity & Lore
Virizion (Pokedex #640) is the Grassland Pokémon, a legendary figure first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known as a member of the "Swords of Justice" alongside Cobalion, Terrakion, and Keldeo, Virizion is celebrated in myths for its role in protecting Pokémon from human-driven conflicts and forest fires. It possesses a majestic, stag-like appearance with a verdant green coat and horns that function as sharp, elegant blades. While the original Virizion is a creature of legend, recent discoveries in the Paldea region have identified a futuristic Paradox relative known as **Iron Leaves**, which shares its silhouette but utilizes Psychic-type energy. Virizion is renowned for its swift, whirlwind-like movements, using its speed to confound enemies before striking with its signature blade-like appendages.

## Evolution & Biology
Virizion is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It is a genderless entity belonging to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, it is noted for its high hatch counter of 80, reflecting its status as a rare and powerful legendary being. Its physiology is built for agility and grace, allowing it to dart through dense forests with ease. In competitive scenarios, its high base 129 Special Defense allows it to absorb powerful elemental attacks that would faint other Fighting-types, while its base 108 Speed allows it to outpace many threats in the Unova and subsequent regional circuits.
