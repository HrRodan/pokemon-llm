## Identity & Lore
Drizzile (Pokedex #817) is the Water Lizard Pokémon, a distinctive blue-colored bipedal creature introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). As the middle stage of the Galar region's Water-type starter line, Drizzile represents a transitional "adolescent" phase, characterized by its clever and somewhat cautious combat style. It is known to secrete moisture from its palms to create water balloons, which it uses as tactical projectiles to strike foes with surprising precision. Though Drizzile does not possess a unique form itself, its final evolution, Inteleon, is capable of achieving a Gigantamax form, where it becomes a masterful sniper atop a massive water tower. Drizzile is often found near water sources where it can remain moist and maintain its tactical advantage.
