## Identity & Lore
Landorus-Incarnate (Pokedex #645) is the Abundance Pokémon, a legendary Ground and Flying-type deity that first appeared in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a muscular, genie-like figure atop a cloud with a distinctive hammer-like tail, Landorus is revered as the "Guardian of the Fields." Lore states that lands visited by Landorus yield such bountiful crops that it is considered a god of agriculture. It serves as the master of the Forces of Nature trio, acting as a mediator to quell the destructive storms caused by its counterparts, Thundurus and Tornadus. While this form is its "Incarnate Forme," Landorus can transform into its predatory, quadrupedal **Therian Forme** when exposed to a **Reveal Glass**. In more recent history, it was discovered to have a fourth counterpart, Enamorus, originating from the Hisui region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 89, Attack 125, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 115, Sp. Def 80, Speed 101.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker / Special Sweeper. Landorus-Incarnate is feared most for its ability to dismantle defensive cores using its high Special Attack and Speed tier.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice** and a standard weakness to **Water**. However, it possesses two valuable immunities to **Electric** and **Ground** and resists **Fighting, Poison, and Bug** types.
* **Move Selection:** While its Attack is higher, Landorus-Incarnate is most effective as a Special Attacker due to its hidden ability. Key moves include **Earth Power** (primary STAB), **Sandsear Storm** (its signature high-damage Ground move), **Sludge Wave** (for Fairy coverage), and **Focus Blast** (to break through Steel and Dark types). It also utilizes **U-turn** for momentum and **Stealth Rock** for entry hazard support.
* **Abilities:** **Sand Force** (increases the power of Ground, Rock, and Steel-type moves by 30% during a sandstorm). **Sheer Force** (Hidden Ability: increases the damage of moves with secondary effects by 30% but removes those effects; this is its premier competitive ability, especially when paired with a Life Orb to negate recoil).

## Evolution & Biology
Landorus is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to an evolutionary line. However, it possesses a unique biological fluidity known as **Forme Reversion**. While in its Incarnate Forme, it focuses on mixed offensive pressure and utility. Using the **Reveal Glass**, it can shift into its **Therian Forme**, which drastically alters its base stats (increasing Attack while slightly lowering Speed) and replaces its ability with **Intimidate**. As a legendary entity, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group and cannot be bred. Its biology is tied to the energy of the earth; the tail absorbs nutrients from the soil to fertilize the land it travels over.
