## Identity & Lore
Palkia (Pokedex #484) is the legendary **Spatial Pokémon** introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Revered as a deity in Sinnoh mythology, this powerful entity has the ability to distort space, creating connections between distant dimensions or shredding the fabric of reality entirely. Palkia stands as a member of the **Creation Trio**, alongside Dialga (Time) and Giratina (Antimatter). Physically, it is a massive, bipedal theropod-like dragon with pearl-encrusted shoulders and purple-striped armor. While primarily known in its standard form, Palkia possesses a true **Origin Forme** (discovered in the Hisui region), where it adopts a centaur-like appearance resembling the creator, Arceus.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 120, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 150, Sp. Def 120, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Water/Dragon** type, Palkia has a phenomenal defensive profile. It is **weak to Dragon and Fairy**. Conversely, it boasts a **double resistance (0.25x) to Fire and Water**, and a standard resistance to **Steel**. Notably, the Water typing neutralizes Dragon's standard Ice weakness, and the Dragon typing neutralizes Water's Grass and Electric weaknesses.

An optimal set includes its signature move **Spacial Rend** (High crit rate Dragon STAB), **Hydro Pump** (High power Water STAB), **Fire Blast** (Coverage against Steel-types), and **Earth Power** (Coverage against Electric and Steel).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces opposing Pokémon to use double the PP for every move efficiently stalling out low-PP moves.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden):** Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it, making Palkia immune to friendly fire (like Earthquake or Surf) in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Palkia is a **Legendary Pokémon** and does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it cannot breed. In the context of lore and gameplay, Palkia can alternate between its standard form and Origin Forme when interacting with the **Lustrous Globe**. Its base happiness is 0, reflecting its primal and god-like nature, and it has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach level 100.
