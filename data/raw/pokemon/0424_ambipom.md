## Identity & Lore
Ambipom (Pokédex #424) is the Long Tail Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Distinctive for its purple fur and split tails, this Normal-type creature has evolved to rely almost exclusively on its two highly dexterous tails for daily tasks, to the point where it rarely uses its actual arms. Biological studies indicate that to eat, it deftly shucks nuts using these prehensile appendages. Living primarily in tree colonies, Ambipom are known for their playful and mischievous nature, often linking tails with others of their kind as a sign of friendship.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 100, Defense 66, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 66, Speed 115.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Pivot / Lead.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**. As a pure Normal type, it has no elemental resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and Attack, its optimal moveset often utilizes **Fake Out** (for immediate flinching) and **U-turn** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups). For damage, it utilizes **Double Hit** (STAB) or **Low Kick** for coverage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Technician:** Increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%. This makes moves like Fake Out and Double Hit devastatingly powerful.
    *   **Pickup:** Allows the Pokémon to pick up items after a battle or find items used by opponents.
    *   **Skill Link (Hidden):** Ensures that multi-strike moves (like Fury Swipes) always hit the maximum number of times (5 times).

## Evolution & Biology
Ambipom is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Aipom** when leveled up while knowing the move **Double Hit**. Because this evolution is dependent on a specific move rather than a specific level, it can occur at various stages of the Pokémon's growth. Ambipom belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20.
