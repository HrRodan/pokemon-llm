## Identity & Lore
Mega Feraligatr (Pokedex #10283) is the Mega Evolved form of the Big Jaw Pokémon, a powerful crocodilian apex predator originally discovered in the Johto region (Generation II). While the base form is a pure Water-type, this Mega Evolution taps into its primal ancestry, gaining a dual Water/Dragon typing. Standing at 2.3 meters and weighing over 100 kilograms, it is a blue, bipedal powerhouse characterized by its massive, bone-crushing jaws. According to its lore, when it bites with its powerful mandibles, it shakes its head with such ferocity that it can effortlessly tear victims apart. While it does not possess a Gigantamax form, this Mega Evolution represents the pinnacle of its physical evolution, transforming it from a standard starter Pokémon into a draconic terror of the water's edge.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 160, Defense 125, Sp. Atk 89, Sp. Def 93, Speed 78.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Wallbreaker. With a massive base Attack of 160 and high natural Defense, it functions as a primary offensive threat that can trade hits effectively.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Water/Dragon type, it is **weak to Dragon and Fairy**. It possesses significant defensive utility, providing a **Double Resistance (4x)** to both Fire and Water-type attacks, while also resisting Steel-type moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite physical prowess and its newly acquired Dragon typing, key moves include **Liquidation** (for STAB-boosted water damage), **Outrage** (to leverage its Dragon-type power), **Dragon Dance** (to patch up its middling Speed and further boost Attack), and **Crunch** (utilizing its "Big Jaw" morphology for coverage).
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-ability data is often specialized, this form typically utilizes abilities like **Sheer Force** (removing secondary effects to maximize raw damage) or **Strong Jaw** (increasing the power of biting moves like Crunch and Ice Fang), aligning with its biological focus on its powerful mandibles.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Feraligatr is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Totodile**, which evolves into **Croconaw** starting at Level 18. The line reaches its standard maturity when Croconaw evolves into **Feraligatr** at Level 30. The transition to its Mega Form is a temporary combat state achieved through the use of a specific Mega Stone. Biologically, it is a highly resilient creature belonging to the **Monster and Water 1** Egg Groups. It has a medium-slow growth rate and is typically found inhabiting the banks of rivers and lakes, where its blue coloration provides camouflage before it lunges at prey with its signature upright, "Big Jaw" stance.
