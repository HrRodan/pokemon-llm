## Identity & Lore
Altaria (Pokedex #334) is the Dragon/Flying-type Humming Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in forests and mountainous altitudes, this avian dragon mimics billowing, cotton-like clouds to camouflage itself while wheeling through the sky. Famous for its crystal-clear soprano voice, Altaria sings melodies that induce a sense of dreamy wonderment in its listeners. While typically Blue and white in coloration, it possesses a powerful transformation known as **Mega Altaria**, capable of occurring when holding an Altarianite, which changes its typing to Dragon/Fairy and significantly boosts its offensive and defensive capabilities.

## Evolution & Biology
Altaria is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Swablu** starting at **Level 35**. It belongs to the **Flying** and **Dragon** Egg Groups and has a unique "slow-then-very-fast" growth rate. While its pre-evolution acts as a cleaner of surroundings, Altaria embraces a more nomadic, aerial lifestyle, bonding with Trainers who appreciate its musical qualities.
