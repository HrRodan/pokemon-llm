## Identity & Lore
Giratina (Pokedex #487) is the Legendary **Renegade Pokémon**, a dual-type Ghost/Dragon entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). This profile details its **Altered Forme**, a six-legged, heavy-set draconian beast, which is the form it takes when outside its home dimension. According to ancient lore, Giratina was banished for its violence to the **Distortion World**, a chaotic dimension on the reverse side of ours where common laws of physics do not apply. It is a member of the Creation Trio, representing antimatter, alongside Dialga and Palkia. While usually grounded in this form, it can transform into its serpentine **Origin Forme** if it holds a Griseous Orb or returns to the Distortion World.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 150, Attack 100, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 120, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Mixed Tank / Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost, Dark, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. However, it possesses massive defensive utility, **resisting Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Poison, and Bug**, while maintaining complete **immunity to Normal and Fighting** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its immense bulk and mixed offensive stats, key moves include its signature move **Shadow Force** (which bypasses Protect), **Will-O-Wisp** (to cripple physical attackers), **Hex** (to exploit status conditions), and **Defog** (for clearing entry hazards).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** The Pokémon raises the foe's PP usage. This is excellent for a tank archetype, forcing opponents to run out of resources faster.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden):** Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it, useful primarily in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Giratina is a Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is part of the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group. While it has no evolutionary line, its form changes are a key biological trait; the Altered Forme is adapted for the heavy gravity of the real world, utilizing six legs and wings to maneuver, whereas the Origin Forme is strictly for levitation in distorted gravity.
