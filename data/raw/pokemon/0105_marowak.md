## Identity & Lore
Marowak (Pokedex #105) is the **Bone Keeper Pokémon**, a Ground-type creature originally discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Evolved from the lonely Cubone, Marowak has overcome its grief to become a fierce and skilled warrior that inhabits **mountainous** regions. It is easily recognized by the skull it wears as a helmet—which has fused to become part of its body—and the bone it wields as a weapon. This Pokémon is famous for its mastery of the bone, throwing it violently like a boomerang to knock out targets with precision. While the standard Marowak is a pure Ground-type, it possesses a well-known regional variant, **Alolan Marowak**, which is a dual Fire/Ghost-type that developed in the Alola region to combat natural predators.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 80, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 80, Speed 45.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Wallbreaker. While its base Attack appears average, Marowak is almost exclusively utilized with its signature held item, the **Thick Club**, which doubles its Attack stat to massive levels.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Ground-type, it is **weak to Water, Grass, and Ice**. It **resists Poison and Rock** damage. Notably, it possesses a natural **immunity to Electric** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its reliance on the Thick Club and high physical damage, key moves include **Bonemerang** (its signature multi-hit move), **Earthquake** (reliable STAB), **Stone Edge** (for Flying-type coverage), and **Swords Dance** (to further boost its wall-breaking potential).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Protects the Pokémon from recoil damage (synergizing with moves like Double-Edge).
    *   **Lightning Rod:** Draws in all Electric-type moves to itself to raise Sp. Atk; highly useful in Double Battles to protect teammates.
    *   **Battle Armor (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from critical hits.

## Evolution & Biology
Marowak is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cubone** starting at **Level 28**. In the Alola region, leveling up Cubone at night transforms it into Alolan Marowak instead. Wild Marowak are known to carry the **Thick Club**, a rare bone that significantly boosts their combat prowess. It belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 20 cycles.
