## Identity & Lore
Pidgeot (Pokédex #018) is the majestic Bird Pokémon, serving as the final evolutionary form of the regional bird from **Generation I (Kanto)**. Renowned for its dazzling plumage and incredible speed, it is capable of flying at Mach 2 speeds to survey its territory. Its powerful chest muscles allow it to whip up strong windstorms with a mere flap of its wings. As a predatory creature inhabiting forest canopies, Pidgeot is known to skim the surface of water at high speeds to snatch unwary prey, such as Magikarp, directly from rivers. While the standard form is well-known, this species possesses the potential to undergo **Mega Evolution** into Mega Pidgeot using a Pidgeotite, drastically altering its combat capabilities.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 83, Attack 80, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 70, Speed 101.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Pivot / Utility Support. While its offensive stats are balanced, its **Speed** is its defining attribute, allowing it to act as a scout or revenge killer. (Note: Its Mega Evolution shifts this role to a Special Sweeper).
*   **Type Matchups:** As a **Normal/Flying** type, it is **weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It possesses valuable **immunities to Ghost and Ground** moves and **resists Bug and Grass** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its slightly higher Attack stat and high Speed, key moves include **Double-Edge** (High power STAB), **U-turn** (for pivoting out of unfavorable matchups), **Steel Wing** (coverage against Rock and Ice types), and **Roost** (for reliable health recovery).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents the Pokémon from losing accuracy.
    *   **Tangled Feet:** Raises evasion significantly if the Pokémon becomes confused.
    *   **Big Pecks (Hidden Ability):** Protects the Pokémon from Defense-lowering effects.

## Evolution & Biology
Pidgeot is the final stage of a **3-stage evolutionary line**. It evolves from **Pidgeotto** starting at **Level 36**, which itself evolves from **Pidgey** at **Level 18**. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles. This lineage is often the first Flying-type acquisition for trainers in the Kanto region.
