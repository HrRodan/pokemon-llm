## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Growlithe (Pokedex #10229) is the Puppy Pokémon, a distinct regional variant found in the ancient Hisui region (the precursor to modern-day Sinnoh) first discovered in Generation VIII. Unlike its Kantonian counterpart, Hisuian Growlithe is characterized by its voluminous, stone-like fur, which is infused with volcanic components to provide protection against the frigid Hisuian climate. It is a quadrupedal, brown-colored Pokémon that is fiercely protective of its territory, often seen patrolling its space and using sharp barks or bites to repel any perceived intruders. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved state, Hisuian Arcanine, is celebrated in Hisuian lore as a powerful and noble guardian.
