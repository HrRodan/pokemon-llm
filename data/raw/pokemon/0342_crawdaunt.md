## Identity & Lore
Crawdaunt (#342) is the Rogue Pokémon, a violent and territorial crustacean originally discovered in the Hoenn region (Generation III). Known for its aggressive temperament, this red, armored Pokémon possesses an extremely volatile nature that compels it to challenge any living thing it encounters. Consequently, the ponds and waterways inhabited by Crawdaunt are often described as desolate places, as other local wildlife flees or is driven out by its belligerence. It resides primarily at the water's edge. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its reputation as a powerhouse relies heavily on its raw physical strength.

## Evolution & Biology
Crawdaunt is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Corphish** starting at **Level 30**. Unlike many Pokémon that require stones or trading, Crawdaunt matures purely through combat experience and leveling.
