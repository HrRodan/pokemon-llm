## Identity & Lore
Solgaleo (Pokedex #791) is the Sunne Pokémon, a majestic and powerful Legendary creature originating from the Alola region (Generation VII). This massive, white quadruped is often referred to in ancient texts as "the beast that devours the sun." It possesses a unique physiology that allows it to radiate intense, midday-like light from its body, capable of illuminating the darkest nights. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Solgaleo is central to the lore of Ultra Space and can undergo a unique fusion with the legendary Necrozma to become **Dusk Mane Necrozma**, utilizing the N-Solarizer. It is said to originate from another dimension, traversing Ultra Wormholes with ease and acting as a guardian of the Alolan islands alongside its counterpart, Lunala.

* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Attack stat and signature capabilities, Solgaleo excels with moves like **Sunsteel Strike** (which ignores the opponent's ability), **Psychic Fangs** for STAB damage and screen-breaking, **Earthquake** for coverage against Fire types, and **Flare Blitz** to surprise Steel-type mirrors. It also utilizes **Morning Sun** to maintain its massive HP pool.
* **Abilities:** Full Metal Body (This ability prevents other Pokémon's moves or abilities from lowering Solgaleo's stats, making it immune to the effects of Intimidate or moves like Leer).

## Evolution & Biology
Solgaleo is the final stage of a rare three-stage legendary evolutionary line. It begins as the small, gaseous **Cosmog**, which evolves into the cocoon-like **Cosmoem** starting at Level 43. Cosmoem then evolves into **Solgaleo** starting at Level 53, a transition historically tied to the influence of the sun (specifically in Pokémon Sun, Ultra Sun, and Sword versions). Despite its massive size and biological complexity, Solgaleo belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. It has a significantly high hatch counter of 120, reflecting its status as a Rare/Legendary entity. Biologically, its body stores a vast amount of energy, and when it releases this energy, it enters its "Radiant Sun" phase, glowing with a brilliance that mimics the sun itself.
