## Identity & Lore
Magby (Pokedex #240) is the Live Coal Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). This small, red, bipedal Pokémon resides primarily in volcanic craters and **mountain** habitats. It is characterized by its perpetually high body temperature; according to its biology, hot embers dribble from its mouth and nostrils every time it inhales and exhales. As a **Baby Pokémon**, Magby represents the earliest stage of the distinguished Magmar line. While it lacks the sheer size of its evolved forms, its blood is said to be as hot as magma, and it is known to have a hasty temperament.
