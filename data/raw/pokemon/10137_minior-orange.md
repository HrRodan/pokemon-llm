## Identity & Lore
Orange Core Minior (#10137) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique celestial being originally discovered in the Alola region (Generation VII). This specific form represents Minior in its exposed "Core" state after its heavy, outer rocky shell has been negated. Minior naturally inhabits the ozone layer, where it feeds on dust particles; the specific color of its core—in this case, a vibrant orange—is determined by the chemical composition of the debris it consumed while soaring through the atmosphere. When its outer shell becomes too heavy with accumulated matter, it hurtles toward the planet's surface like a falling star. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biological gimmick revolves entirely around its "Shields Down" transformation, which dictates its physical appearance and combat efficacy.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper. In this Core form, Minior sacrifices its defensive integrity for a massive boost in offensive pressure and mobility.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Rock/Flying type, it is **weak to Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Steel, and Rock**. It compensates with **resistances to Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Minior is famous for its "Shell Smash" set, which allows it to become a terrifying late-game cleaner. Key moves include **Shell Smash** to double its offensive stats, **Acrobatics** (which doubles in power once its held item is consumed during the shell break), **Power Gem** for reliable Special Rock-type STAB, and **Earthquake** or **Meteor Beam** for high-impact coverage against Steel and Fire types.
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon starts in its "Meteor Form," providing high defensive stats and immunity to status conditions. When its HP drops below 50%, the shell shatters, transforming it into this "Core Form" where its Speed and offensive stats significantly increase).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and its biology is dictated by its shell-shattering mechanic. While in its Meteor form, it is heavy and brownish; however, the Orange Core seen here is remarkably light, weighing only 0.3kg and measuring 0.3 meters. Its "Orange" classification is one of seven possible core colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet), all of which share the same base stats and move pools but differ in aesthetic rarity and the environment in which they were formed in the stratosphere.
