## Identity & Lore
Weezing (Pokedex #110) is the Poison Gas Pokémon, a dual-headed entity originally discovered in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Characterized by its **purple**, spherical body covered in crater-like protrusions and skull-and-crossbones markings, Weezing represents the accumulation of toxins in an **urban** environment. According to research, this Pokémon comes into existence when two Koffing fuse together over many years in areas where distinct poisonous gases mix. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution, it has a notable regional variant known as **Galarian Weezing**, which adopts a Poison/Fairy typing and appearance resembling industrial smokestacks.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 90, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 70, Speed 60.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Utility Disrupter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Poison-type, it naturally resists **Grass, Fighting, Poison, Bug, and Fairy**. While typically weak to Ground and Psychic, its primary ability negates one of these major threats.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Defense and respectable offensive stats, Weezing excels with a kit focused on attrition and coverage:
    *   **Sludge Bomb:** Reliable S.T.A.B. (Same Type Attack Bonus) with a high chance to poison.
    *   **Will-O-Wisp:** Crucial for burning physical attackers, effectively doubling Weezing's already high survivability.
    *   **Pain Split:** Exploits Weezing's lower base HP to heal itself while damaging high-HP opponents.
    *   **Flamethrower:** Provides essential coverage against Steel-type Pokémon that are immune to its Poison attacks.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Levitate:** A defining tactical ability that grants full immunity to **Ground-type** moves, removing a primary weakness.
    *   **Neutralizing Gas:** A potent competitive ability that suppresses and negates the effects of all other Pokémon's abilities on the field.
    *   **Stench (Hidden):** Grants a small chance to cause the opponent to flinch when attacking.

## Evolution & Biology
Weezing is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Koffing** starting at **Level 35**. Biologically, one of its heads is typically larger than the other, and they communicate via telepathy to mix gases for creating toxins. It belongs to the **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
