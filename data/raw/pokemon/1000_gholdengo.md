## Identity & Lore
Gholdengo (Pokedex #1000) is the Coin Entity Pokémon, a landmark species introduced in Generation IX (Paldea) as the one-thousandth entry in the National Pokédex. Its humanoid body is composed entirely of a stack of 1,000 gold coins, which it can manipulate for both movement—often manifesting a surfboard made of coins—and combat. Found primarily in the Paldea region, Gholdengo is described as an exceptionally gregarious Pokémon that quickly befriends humans and Pokémon alike. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, its unique status as the "millennial" Pokémon gives it a legendary-like prestige. Its golden, metallic luster is a testament to the 1,000 Gimmighoul coins required for its evolution, symbolizing wealth and prosperity within the Pokémon world.

## Evolution & Biology
Gholdengo is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Gimmighoul** (either its Chest or Roaming Form) through a unique environmental trigger: the trainer must collect **999 Gimmighoul Coins** and then level Gimmighoul up. Once the coins are consumed, the Pokémon integrates them into its physical form to reach its gilded state. Biologically, it is a genderless entity and belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** group, meaning it cannot be bred in Daycare or Picnic facilities. Despite its heavy metallic composition, it is surprisingly agile, using its coin-manipulation abilities to adapt to various terrains.
