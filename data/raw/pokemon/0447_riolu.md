## Identity & Lore
Riolu (Pokedex #447) is the Emanation Pokémon, a Fighting-type introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A small, blue, canine-like Pokémon, Riolu is distinguished by the "aura" it emits, which intensifies to alert others when it is afraid or sad. Unlike its evolved form, Riolu cannot yet manipulate this aura for offensive attacks, but it possesses boundless stamina and can run swiftly throughout the night. It is classified as a **Baby Pokémon**, meaning it cannot breed. Riolu evolves into the renowned **Lucario**, which gains the Steel type and is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Lucario.
