## Identity & Lore
Talonflame (Pokedex #663) is the Scorching Pokémon, a powerful avian predator first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. As the final evolution of the Fletchling line, Talonflame is renowned for its incredible flight speeds, reaching over 310 mph while diving for prey. Its crimson plumage is not merely for display; during the heat of an exciting battle, Talonflame showers embers from the gaps between its feathers, creating a localized firestorm to intimidate and scorch its foes. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it remains one of the most iconic regional birds in the Pokémon world due to its unique Fire/Flying typing and its historical dominance in competitive circuits. It is frequently found in mountainous or forest-fringe habitats where it can utilize its aerial maneuvers to outclass smaller bird Pokémon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 78, Attack 81, Defense 71, Sp. Atk 74, Sp. Def 69, Speed 126.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Revenge Killer / Priority Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**, and is also **weak to Water and Electric**. Conversely, it is **immune to Ground** and provides massive defensive utility by **resisting Fire, Fighting, Steel, and Fairy**, while possessing a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Grass and Bug**.
* **Move Selection:** Talonflame relies on its blistering speed and high-recoil STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves to punch holes in teams. Key moves include **Brave Bird** (high-power Flying physical), **Flare Blitz** (high-power Fire physical), **Roost** (reliable recovery), and **U-turn** (pivoting and momentum). It also excels as a support lead using **Tailwind** or **Will-O-Wisp**.
* **Abilities:** **Flame Body** provides a 30% chance to burn opponents who make contact, making it a natural deterrent to physical attackers (and a favorite for trainers hatching eggs). Its Hidden Ability, **Gale Wings**, grants priority to Flying-type moves when Talonflame is at full HP, allowing it to strike first with a powerful Brave Bird or a clutch Roost.

## Evolution & Biology
Talonflame is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Fletchling**, a Normal/Flying type. It evolves into the Fire/Flying **Fletchinder** starting at Level 17, and reaches its ultimate form as **Talonflame** upon reaching Level 35. Biologically, Talonflame is optimized for high-speed pursuit, featuring a streamlined "wings" body shape and a relatively light weight of 24.5 kg, which aids its aerial agility. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive use. In the wild, its behavior is aggressive and predatory, often preying on Bug-type Pokémon which it easily incinerates with its fire-breathing capabilities.
