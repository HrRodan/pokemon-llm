## Identity & Lore
Serperior (Pokedex #497) is the Regal Pokémon, a majestic serpentine creature introduced in Generation V (Unova). Distinguished by its pale green coloration and noble countenance, this Pokémon is known for its intensely haughty nature; it holds its head high to intimidate foes and will only battle opponents it deems worthy of its time. According to research, Serperior can arrest an enemy's movement with a single piercing glare and possesses the biological capability to internally amplify the solar energy it absorbs. While it resembles a snake, it retains vestigial arms usually held behind its back, revealing them only when necessary.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 75, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 95, Speed 113.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Sub-Seed Utility.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug** moves. It **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and unique ability synergy, key moves include **Leaf Storm** (which boosts Sp. Atk when paired with Contrary), **Dragon Pulse** (for coverage), **Giga Drain** (for sustain), and **Glare** (to paralyze faster threats).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Overgrow:** Powers up Grass-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Contrary (Hidden):** Reverses the effect of stat changes. This is Serperior's most competitively viable trait, turning the stat-lowering effect of powerful moves like *Leaf Storm* into a sharp stat increase.

## Evolution & Biology
Serperior is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Servine** starting at **Level 36**, which in turn evolves from **Snivy** starting at **Level 17**. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Plant** Egg Groups. Unlike its pre-evolutions, Serperior has mostly lost the use of its legs, relying on slithering at high speeds to outmaneuver prey.
