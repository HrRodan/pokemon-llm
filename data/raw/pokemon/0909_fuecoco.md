## Identity & Lore
Fuecoco (Pokedex #909) is the Fire Croc Pokémon and serves as the Fire-type starter for trainers beginning their journey in the Paldea region (Generation IX). This bipedal, crocodilian Pokémon is easily identified by its stout red body and the two yellow scales atop its head that resemble sprouts. Fuecoco is known for its laid-back and dimwitted nature, often moving at its own pace. Its physiology is unique; it lies on warm rocks and uses the square-shaped scales on its body to absorb heat, which it then converts into fire energy. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolutionary stage, Skeledirge, is a formidable Fire/Ghost-type that has become a staple in competitive play due to its signature move, Torch Song, and its synergy with the Terastal phenomenon.

## Evolution & Biology
Fuecoco is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Crocalor** starting at Level 16, and reaches its final form, **Skeledirge**, at Level 36. Biologically, Fuecoco is a scavenger with a "Medium-Slow" growth rate, reflecting its relaxed approach to life. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, and its eggs have a hatch counter of 20. Its evolution marks a transition from a simple fire-breathing reptile to a complex creature that utilizes sound and spiritual energy, eventually gaining the Ghost typing upon reaching its final stage.
