## Identity & Lore
Darkrai (Pokédex #491) is the Mythical Pitch-Black Pokémon first discovered in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A creature of deep shadow, it is notoriously known for its ability to lull people and Pokémon into deep slumbers, trapping them in endless, terrifying nightmares. This behavior is often a defensive mechanism rather than an act of malice, as Darkrai lulls intruders to sleep to protect its territory, typically active during nights of the new moon. In the lore of the Sinnoh region, it resides on Newmoon Island and serves as the dark counterpart to Cresselia, forming the "Lunar Duo." While it does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its mastery over the dream realm makes it a formidable entity.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 90, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 90, Speed 125.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Sleep Disruptor.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dark-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Bug, and Fairy** attacks. It **resists Ghost and Dark** moves and possesses a complete **immunity to Psychic** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its blistering Speed and massive Special Attack, its most effective kit includes its signature move **Dark Void** (to induce sleep), **Nasty Plot** (to sharply raise Special Attack), **Dark Pulse** (for reliable STAB damage), and **Sludge Bomb** (for coverage against Fairy-type threats).
*   **Abilities:** **Bad Dreams** (Causes the opponent to lose 1/8th of their maximum HP at the end of each turn if they are asleep). This ability synergizes perfectly with sleep-inducing moves like Dark Void or Hypnosis, turning the opponent's inactivity into passive damage.

## Evolution & Biology
Darkrai is a standalone Mythical Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other species. As a Mythical Pokémon, it belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot be bred. In the wild, it is exceptionally rare, often requiring specific event items (such as the Member Card) or unique in-game events to encounter.
