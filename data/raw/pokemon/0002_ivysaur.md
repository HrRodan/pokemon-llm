## Identity & Lore
Ivysaur (Pokedex #002) is the **Seed Pokémon**, a dual-type **Grass/Poison** creature introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Distinctive for its cyan-green coloration and the large, pink flower bud on its back, Ivysaur inhabits grasslands where it absorbs sunlight to fuel its growth. Unlike its pre-evolution, the weight of the developing bulb forces Ivysaur to become a strict quadruped, losing the ability to stand on its hind legs to support the load. When the flower is ready to bloom, the bulb gives off a sweet aroma, signaling that evolution is near. While Ivysaur does not possess alternate forms, its final evolution, Venusaur, is capable of both **Mega Evolution** and **Gigantamaxing**.

## Evolution & Biology
Ivysaur is the second stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bulbasaur** starting at **Level 16** and evolves into **Venusaur** starting at **Level 32**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Monster** and **Plant** Egg Groups. The bud on its back draws energy from the sun, and its growth rate is considered medium-slow.
