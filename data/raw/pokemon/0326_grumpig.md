## Identity & Lore
Grumpig (#326) is the Manipulate Pokémon, a Psychic-type entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Distinguished by its purple skin and the valuable black pearls on its forehead and chest, Grumpig inhabits mountainous regions. It is renowned for its bizarre dance steps, which it performs to emit psychic waves; these waves are amplified by its black pearls, allowing it to manipulate the minds of its opponents. While using its powers, its snorting breath becomes noticeably labored. Though it lacks known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is the mature form of the restless Spoink.

## Evolution & Biology
