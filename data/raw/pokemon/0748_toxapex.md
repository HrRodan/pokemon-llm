## Identity & Lore
Toxapex (Pokedex #748) is the Brutal Star Pokémon, a formidable marine predator first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This blue, twelve-legged organism is notorious for its predatory behavior, specifically its tendency to crawl along the ocean floor leaving a trail of Corsola remains in its wake. Its body is composed of a small internal core protected by a massive, dome-like arrangement of powerful, spiked tentacles. While Toxapex does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence in the ecosystem is so dominant that it has fundamentally shaped the biology of its prey (such as the evolution of Galarian Corsola). Its appearance is characterized by its sinister, spiked exterior which serves as both an impenetrable shield and a lethal weapon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 63, Defense 152, Sp. Atk 53, Sp. Def 142, Speed 35.

* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Psychic, and Electric** types. It boasts a staggering array of resistances, effectively **resisting Fighting, Poison, Bug, Steel, Fire, Water, Ice, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical Attack being its highest offensive stat alongside its legendary survivability, key moves include **Gunk Shot** for massive physical Poison-type damage, **Liquidation** for reliable Water-type STAB, **Recover** for essential longevity, and its signature move **Baneful Bunker**, which protects the user while poisoning any opponent that makes contact.
* **Abilities:** **Merciless** (guarantees critical hits against poisoned targets), **Limber** (prevents the Pokémon from being paralyzed), and its most competitive trait, the Hidden Ability **Regenerator** (restores 1/3 of the Pokémon's maximum HP upon switching out of battle).

## Evolution & Biology
Toxapex is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Mareanie** once it reaches **Level 38**. Biologically, it is designed for endurance; it can withstand the intense pressure of the deep ocean and uses its tentacles to create a sheltered space where it is safe from the elements. It belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and is known to occasionally carry a **Poison Barb**, which enhances the potency of its venomous strikes. Its hatching process is moderately paced, requiring a hatch counter of 20. In competitive environments, it is often utilized with the move **Haze** to eliminate an opponent's stat increases, making it one of the most difficult Pokémon to overcome without specialized coverage moves.
