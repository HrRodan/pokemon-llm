## Identity & Lore
Regirock (Pokedex #377) is the Legendary Rock Peak Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A member of the **Legendary Titans**, Regirock is an inorganic creature constructed entirely of rocks and stones. Unlike organic lifeforms, it possesses no brain or heart; its life force is sustained by a mysterious energy. If its body is damaged in battle, Regirock seeks out new rocks from its cave habitat to repair itself, resulting in a patchwork appearance of different stone types and colors. It was sealed away in the Desert Ruins by ancient people who feared its immense power. While it has no known evolutionary relatives, it serves as a creation of the master titan, **Regigigas**.

## Evolution & Biology
Regirock is a stand-alone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group and cannot be bred. In the lore of the Hoenn region, encountering Regirock typically requires solving intricate Braille puzzles to unseal the chambers where the Titans dwell. Its physiology allows it to survive in any environment provided there are stones available for self-repair.
