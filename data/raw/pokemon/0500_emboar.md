## Identity & Lore
Emboar (Pokedex #500) is the Mega Fire Pig Pokémon, a formidable Fire/Fighting-type first introduced in Generation V (Unova). Resembling a powerful wrestler based on a wild boar, this massive Pokémon is distinguished by the flaming beard of fire that wreaths its neck and chin. It uses this fire to ignite its fists, delivering scorching punches capable of massive destruction. Despite its intimidating appearance and red coloration, Emboar is known for possessing a loyal heart, caring deeply for its friends and mastering the fighting style of its opponents to improve its own technique. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it stands as the fully evolved Starter Pokémon of the Unova region.
