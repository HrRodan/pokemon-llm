## Identity & Lore
Helioptile (Pokedex #694) is the Generator Pokémon, a unique dual-type Electric and Normal species first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This small, bipedal lizard is primarily a desert dweller, possessing a yellow hide that reflects the harsh sun of its arid habitat. Its most striking features are the large, black, ear-like frills on the sides of its head; when flared, these frills act as biological solar panels, absorbing radiation to generate electricity. This process is so efficient that Helioptile can survive indefinitely without eating food, sustaining itself entirely on the power it harvests from the sun. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biology is highly sought after by engineers in the Pokémon world, as its evolved form, Heliolisk, is capable of generating enough power to provide electricity for an entire skyscraper.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 44, Attack 38, Defense 33, Sp. Atk 61, Sp. Def 43, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper (Little Cup Tier).
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground and Fighting**. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**, and carries a valuable **Immunity to Ghost**-type attacks thanks to its Normal typing.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Special Attack and Speed, Helioptile is most effective with **Thunderbolt** for heavy STAB damage, **Volt Switch** for tactical pivoting, **Surf** for essential coverage against Ground-types, and **Parabolic Charge** for sustained health recovery during combat.
* **Abilities:** **Dry Skin** (Restores HP in Rain or when hit by Water moves, but increases vulnerability to Fire), **Sand Veil** (Boosts evasion during Sandstorms), and the Hidden Ability **Solar Power** (Increases Special Attack by 50% in harsh sunlight, but drains HP every turn).

## Evolution & Biology
Helioptile is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into Heliolisk only when **exposed to a Sun Stone**, regardless of its level. This evolution transforms it into a much more formidable predator capable of sprinting across water. Biologically, Helioptile is a member of both the **Monster and Dragon** egg groups, hinting at a more primal lineage than its mechanical "Generator" classification suggests. It has a medium growth rate and a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively accessible choice for trainers looking to breed for specific weather-based abilities like Dry Skin or Solar Power, which allow it to thrive in diverse competitive weather archetypes (Rain and Sun teams, respectively).
