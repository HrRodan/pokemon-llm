## Identity & Lore
Stoutland (Pokedex #508) is the Big-Hearted Pokémon, a majestic and loyal quadruped introduced in the Unova region (Generation V). Characterized by its long, flowing gray and cream-colored fur, this Pokémon is renowned for its benevolent nature and extreme resilience to cold. Its shaggy coat is so effective at trapping heat that it can comfortably survive sub-zero temperatures, making it a legendary rescue Pokémon for those stranded in blizzard-prone mountain ranges. While Stoutland does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is celebrated across regions for its utility and intelligence, notably serving as a keen-nosed Poke Ride search-and-rescue specialist in the Alola region.

* **Abilities:** **Intimidate** (automatically lowers the opponent's Attack upon entry, increasing Stoutland's physical bulk); **Sand Rush** (doubles its Speed stat during a Sandstorm, transforming it into a dangerous late-game cleaner); **Scrappy** (its Hidden Ability, which allows its Normal and Fighting-type moves to hit Ghost-type Pokémon, negating their usual immunity).

## Evolution & Biology
Stoutland is the final form of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Lillipup**, a curious and intelligent canine. Lillipup evolves into **Herdier** starting at Level 16, at which point it becomes more protective and alert. The cycle concludes when Herdier evolves into **Stoutland** at Level 32. Biologically, it is a member of the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group, and its development is categorized by a Medium-Slow growth rate. Breeders note a hatch counter of 15, reflecting the time and care required to raise this sophisticated and reliable companion.
