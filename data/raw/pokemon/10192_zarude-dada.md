## Identity & Lore
Zarude-Dada (Pokedex #10192) is the Rogue Monkey Pokémon, a unique Mythical variant of the standard Zarude distinguished by the pink cloth it wears around its neck. First discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII), this specific form represents a Zarude that separated from its pack to raise a human child, developing a paternal bond—the term "Dada" reflects this parental role. While the species is generally known to be incredibly aggressive and feared by other Pokémon in dense forests like the Forest of Okoya, the Dada form signifies a shift toward protective, albeit still ferocious, behavior. It utilizes the vines that grow from its wrists for both movement and combat, swinging through the canopy with high agility. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Mythical Pokémon places it among the rarest entities in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 105, Attack 120, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 95, Speed 105.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker / Pivot. Its high natural bulk combined with a base 105 Speed tier allows it to outpace many mid-tier threats while sustaining hits.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a Dark/Grass type, resulting in a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug**. It also carries weaknesses to **Fighting, Fairy, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Ice**. Conversely, it resists **Ground, Ghost, Water, Grass, Electric, and Dark**, and possesses a complete immunity to **Psychic** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high 120 Attack stat, Zarude-Dada excels with a kit focusing on physical pressure and its signature utility. Key moves include **Power Whip** (high-power Grass STAB), **Darkest Lariat** (Dark STAB that ignores opponent's stat changes), **Close Combat** (vital Fighting-type coverage), and its signature move **Jungle Healing**, which restores HP and heals status conditions for both itself and allies.
* **Abilities:** Leaf Guard (Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by non-volatile status conditions like burn, paralysis, or sleep during harsh sunlight). This makes it an excellent addition to "Sun" weather teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Zarude-Dada is a standalone Mythical Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. Biologically, it is a simian creature of impressive stature, standing 1.8 meters tall and weighing 70.0 kg. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is centered around the cultivation of prehensile vines that draw nutrients from the trees in its habitat; in the Dada form, these vines are used with a degree of finesse to provide for and protect its charge. Despite its "Green" classification, its fur is primarily dark, providing camouflage within the deep shadows of primordial jungles.
