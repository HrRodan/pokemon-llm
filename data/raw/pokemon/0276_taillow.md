## Identity & Lore
Taillow (Pokedex #276) is the Tiny Swallow Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Distinct for its dark blue feathers and red chest markings, this avian Pokémon inhabits grasslands and open fields. Despite its diminutive size (0.3m), Taillow is defined by its ferocious temperament and immense willpower; it courageously stands its ground against foes much larger than itself and will remain defiant even after a loss. While gutsy in battle, it reverts to a demanding nature when hungry, crying loudly to be fed.
