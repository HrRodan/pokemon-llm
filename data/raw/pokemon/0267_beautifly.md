## Identity & Lore
Beautifly (Pokedex #267) is the Butterfly Pokémon, first introduced in **Generation III** within the **Hoenn** region. Known for its aggressively vibrant appearance, this dual-type Bug/Flying Pokémon is often found in forests where it seeks out flower nectar. While its Pokedex entries describe a preference for sweet pollen—often attracted to potted flowers placed by open windows—Beautifly possesses a surprisingly aggressive nature in the wild, using its long, coiled mouthpart to drain fluids from prey. It is the diurnal counterpart to the nocturnal Dustox.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 70, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 50, Speed 65.
*   **Archetype:** Setup Special Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is notably fragile, suffering from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock** type moves. It is also weak to **Fire, Electric, Ice, and Flying**. However, it boasts useful resistances to Bug, a **double resistance (1/4 damage) to Fighting and Grass**, and a complete **immunity to Ground** type attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its dominant Special Attack stat (100) and access to the premier bug setup move, its optimal kit includes **Quiver Dance** (to boost Speed, Sp. Atk, and Sp. Def simultaneously), **Bug Buzz** (Primary STAB), **Air Slash** (Secondary STAB), and **Giga Drain** or **Shadow Ball** for coverage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swarm:** Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Rivalry (Hidden):** Deals more damage to Pokémon of the same gender, but less damage to Pokémon of the opposite gender.

## Evolution & Biology
Beautifly is the final stage of a unique branching 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Wurmple**, which evolves into **Silcoon** starting at **Level 7**. Silcoon then transforms into Beautifly starting at **Level 10**.
*   **Unique Evolution Mechanic:** Whether a Wurmple evolves into Silcoon (leading to Beautifly) or Cascoon (leading to Dustox) is determined by the Pokémon's internal personality value, a hidden mechanic not visible to trainers.
*   **Breeding:** It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
