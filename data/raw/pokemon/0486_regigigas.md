## Identity & Lore
Regigigas (Pokedex #486) is the Legendary **Colossal Pokémon**, a massive entity originating from **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Standing 3.7 meters tall and weighing 420.0 kg, this white, humanoid titan is steeped in ancient mythology. It is revered as the master and creator of the Legendary Titans (Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Regieleki, and Regidrago), having shaped them from clay, ice, magma, and crystallized energy. According to enduring Sinnoh legends, Regigigas possesses immense strength capable of towing entire continents using ropes. Despite its overwhelming power, it usually slumbers deep within ancient structures like the Snowpoint Temple, only awakening when the other titans are gathered. It does not possess any known Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 160, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 110, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Delayed Physical Juggernaut.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Normal** type, it is **weak to Fighting** and holds a unique **immunity to Ghost** attacks. It does not naturally resist any types.
*   **Move Selection:** With a massive Attack stat of 160, Regigigas functions best as a physical attacker once its power is unleashed. Key moves include:
    *   **Crush Grip:** Its signature STAB move which deals damage relative to the target's remaining HP.
    *   **Earthquake:** Provides essential coverage against Rock and Steel types that resist Normal attacks.
    *   **Drain Punch:** A vital tool for longevity, allowing it to recover HP while dealing damage.
    *   **Heavy Slam:** Capitalizes on Regigigas's immense weight (420 kg) to deal massive damage to lighter foes.
    *   *(Notable Utility: **Knock Off** and **Thunder Wave** are also viable to disrupt opponents while stalling).*
*   **Abilities:** **Slow Start** (Signature Ability). This detrimental ability halves the Pokémon's Attack and Speed stats for the first five turns it is on the field, forcing it to stall or survive before it can utilize its true competitive potential.
