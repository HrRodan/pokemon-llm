## Identity & Lore
Iron Bundle (Pokedex #991) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mechanical enigma discovered within the Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero) during the events of Generation IX. While it bears a striking resemblance to the Pokémon Delibird, Iron Bundle is a futuristic relative with a metallic, robotic chassis. According to reports in paranormal magazines like Occulture, it is theorized to be a product of an ancient civilization or a design from the distant future. It stands at 0.6 meters and is characterized by its red plating and a large, detachable spherical tail used to store and blast freezing energy. As a Paradox Pokémon, it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, but it stands as one of the most powerful and dangerous entities found in the depths of the Paldea region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 56, Attack 80, Defense 114, Sp. Atk 124, Sp. Def 60, Speed 136.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a staggering base Speed of 136 and a formidable Special Attack of 124, Iron Bundle is designed to outspeed the vast majority of the competitive meta and deliver heavy damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, Fire, Grass, and Electric**. Conversely, it **resists Ice and Water**.
* **Move Selection:** Iron Bundle maximizes its offensive presence with a movepool that provides perfect neutral coverage. Key moves include **Freeze-Dry** (which uniquely hits Water-types for super-effective damage), **Hydro Pump** for raw STAB power, **Ice Beam** for consistent accuracy, and **Flip Turn** for maintaining offensive momentum by pivoting out of unfavorable matchups. **Encore** is also a staple utility move used to lock opponents into non-damaging status moves.
* **Abilities:** Quark Drive (Automatically boosts the Pokémon's most proficient stat—usually Speed or Special Attack—by 30% or 50% respectively when on Electric Terrain or if the Pokémon is holding a Booster Energy).

## Evolution & Biology
Iron Bundle is a single-stage Paradox Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. Despite its visual similarities to Delibird, it shares no direct evolutionary DNA in the modern era and is treated as a separate biological entity. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is noted for its high base experience yield and a "slow" growth rate, reflecting the difficulty of mastering its high-tech, futuristic capabilities. Its body is composed of materials that behave like a robot, yet it displays the instinctual aggression typical of the Paradox species found in *Pokémon Violet*.
