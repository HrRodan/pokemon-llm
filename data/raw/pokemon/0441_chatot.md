## Identity & Lore
Chatot (Pokedex #441) is the avian **Music Note Pokémon** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Distinguishable by its musical note-shaped head crest and metronome-like tail, Chatot possesses a tongue that mimics the mechanics of a human tongue, allowing it to learn and speak human words. It uses this mimicry as a defense mechanism, imitating the cries of dangerous predators to ward off enemies. If a group of Chatot gathers, they often learn the same saying, creating a chaotic chorus. Historically, this Pokémon is famous for its signature move, **Chatter**, which in earlier generations utilized the Nintendo DS microphone to record player audio. Chatot does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 76, Attack 65, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 92, Sp. Def 42, Speed 91.
*   **Archetype:** **Fast Special Sweeper / Glass Cannon**. Chatot relies heavily on its respectable Speed and Special Attack to deal damage before it gets hit, as its defensive stats are critically low.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a **Normal/Flying** type, it is **weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It possesses **immunities to Ghost and Ground** and resists **Grass and Bug** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and access to sound-based moves, an optimal kit includes:
    *   **Boomburst:** An incredibly high-power Normal-type move with no drawbacks, making Chatot a dangerous wallbreaker.
    *   **Heat Wave:** Provides essential coverage against Steel-types that resist its Normal/Flying STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).
    *   **Chatter:** Its signature move which guarantees confusion on the opponent.
    *   **Nasty Plot:** significantly boosts its Special Attack, allowing it to sweep through teams if given a free turn.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents the Pokémon from losing accuracy.
    *   **Tangled Feet:** Raises evasion if the Pokémon becomes confused.
    *   **Big Pecks (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon's Defense stat from being lowered (generally less useful due to Chatot's already fragile defense).

## Evolution & Biology
Chatot is a **single-stage Pokémon** and does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group. In the wild, it is occasionally found holding a **Metronome**, referencing its rhythmic tail and musical theme. Because it has no evolutionary chain, Chatot reaches its full potential immediately upon capture, though it requires TMs or breeding to access its most powerful competitive moves like Boomburst.
