## Identity & Lore
Solrock (Pokedex #338) is the Meteorite Pokémon introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Resembling an orange sun with rocky spikes, this Pokémon appears to be an extraterrestrial species that fell from space. Biological texts suggest that solar energy is the direct source of its power, causing its body to shine intensely while it rotates during the day. It is famously known as the counterpart to **Lunatone**, representing the sun while Lunatone represents the moon. While Solrock does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is a staple of cosmic-themed locations such as Meteor Falls.

## Evolution & Biology
Solrock is a stand-alone Pokémon that belongs to a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve into or from any other species. Despite its lack of evolution, it shares a strong biological dichotomy with Lunatone. Solrock belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and creates a genderless pairing when breeding.
