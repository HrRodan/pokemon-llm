## Identity & Lore
Boltund (Pokedex #836) is the Dog Pokémon, a sleek and energetic quadruped introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). Known for its incredible stamina and vibrant yellow coat, Boltund serves as a primary example of bio-electric efficiency; it generates massive amounts of electricity within its body and channels that energy directly into its leg muscles. This biological adaptation allows it to run at high speeds non-stop for up to three full days without rest. While Boltund does not possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form, its pre-evolution, Yamper, is a cultural icon in the Galar region, often seen assisting researchers like Sonia. Boltund is frequently utilized by Galar's competitive trainers and working-class citizens alike for its loyalty and unmatched sprinting capabilities.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 69, Attack 90, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 60, Speed 121.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Attacker / Strong Jaw Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground** and **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**.
* **Move Selection:** Boltund excels when leveraging its high Speed and its ability to boost biting moves. Key selections for its moveset include **Thunder Fang** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Psychic Fangs** to shatter screens and hit Poison types, **Crunch** for Dark-type coverage, and **Play Rough** to threaten Dragon and Fighting types. Alternatively, it can utilize **Volt Switch** to act as a fast pivot.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Strong Jaw:** This is Boltund's signature tactical advantage, increasing the power of biting moves (like Thunder Fang, Fire Fang, Psychic Fangs, and Crunch) by 50%.
    * **Competitive (Hidden Ability):** This ability sharply raises Boltund’s Special Attack if an opponent lowers its stats, making it an excellent counter to "Intimidate" users if running a special-attacking set with moves like Thunderbolt or Rising Voltage.

## Evolution & Biology
Boltund is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Yamper** once it reaches **Level 25**. Biologically, Boltund belongs to the **Ground** egg group, and its breeding cycle is characterized by a hatch counter of 20. It follows a **Fast** growth rate, reaching its full combat potential quickly compared to other species. Its physical form is optimized for the "Electrify" move, though it naturally relies on its physical prowess and jaw strength to subdue opponents in the wild.
