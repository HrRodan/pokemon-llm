## Identity & Lore
Dolliv (Pokedex #929) is the Olive Pokémon, a humanoid Grass/Normal-type species introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). With its distinctive green, sprout-like appearance and the three olive-like growths atop its head, Dolliv is renowned for producing a fragrant, high-quality oil that it generously shares with humans and other Pokémon. This symbiotic behavior has allowed the species to coexist with human civilizations since ancient times, particularly in the sun-drenched orchards of the Paldea region. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, its final evolution, Arboliva, is known for its "Seed Sower" ability which influences the battlefield through Grassy Terrain.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 52, Attack 53, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 78, Sp. Def 78, Speed 33.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Eviolite Support. With significantly higher Special stats and very low Speed, Dolliv functions best as a bulky special attacker or a disruptor when equipped with an Eviolite to boost its moderate defenses.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, Bug, and Fighting**. It **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground**, and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost-type** moves due to its Normal typing.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack and utility pool, key moves for Dolliv include **Giga Drain** (for STAB damage and recovery), **Earth Power** (critical coverage against Fire, Poison, and Steel types), **Energy Ball** (reliable high-damage STAB), and **Leaf Storm** (a powerful finishing move).
* **Abilities:** **Early Bird** allows Dolliv to wake up from sleep status in half the usual time, making it resilient against sleep-inducing moves like Spore or Hypnosis. Its Hidden Ability, **Harvest**, provides a 50% chance (100% in Sun) to restore a consumed Berry at the end of each turn, enabling a defensive "Berry-cycling" strategy.

## Evolution & Biology
Dolliv is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Smoliv** starting at **Level 25**, reflecting its growth from a small sprout into a more mature, oil-producing humanoid form. To reach its final potential, Dolliv evolves into **Arboliva** upon reaching **Level 35**. Biologically, Dolliv is part of the **Plant** Egg Group and takes approximately 5,140 steps to hatch. Its nature is defined by the production of its signature oil, which is described as both "tasty" and "fresh-scented," a trait that has made it a historical staple in Paldean agriculture and domestic life.
