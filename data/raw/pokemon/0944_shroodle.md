## Identity & Lore
Shroodle (Pokedex #944) is the Toxic Mouse Pokémon, a small quadrupedal species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Despite its generally mellow and unassuming temperament, this gray-furred Pokémon possesses a fierce defensive mechanism: it coats its sharp front teeth in a potent saliva-based toxin. When provoked, it delivers a bite that can cause immediate paralysis in its attackers. Shroodle is often found in forest or grassy biomes where it can blend into the undergrowth. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the base form of the artistically inclined Grafaiai, known for marking its territory with colorful, poisonous saliva.

    * **Unburden:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat if its held item is consumed or lost, making it an incredibly fast threat in lower-tier play.

## Evolution & Biology
Shroodle is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Grafaiai** once it reaches **Level 28**. Biologically, it is a highly efficient survivor; its small stature (0.2m) and light weight (0.7kg) allow it to move quickly through dense terrain. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** egg group, and breeders should note a hatch counter of 20, suggesting a moderate amount of time required for an egg to hatch. Its growth rate is medium-slow, requiring a dedicated trainer to bring out its full potential before it evolves into its more territorial adult form.
