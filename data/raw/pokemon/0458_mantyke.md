## Identity & Lore
Mantyke (Pokedex #458) is the Water/Flying-type Kite Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A generally friendly and docile species, this Baby Pokémon uses its two antennae to capture the subtle flows of seawater, allowing it to swim gracefully with minimal effort. Its appearance resembles a small manta ray with a smiling face pattern on its back, which varies slightly by region. Mantyke is often found swimming in schools, learning the basics of ocean survival before maturing. While it lacks Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is notable for its unique relationship with Remoraid, which is essential for its maturation process.

## Evolution & Biology
Mantyke is a Baby Pokémon and part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Mantine** when leveled up, but only if a **Remoraid** is present in the trainer's party. This unique evolution method reflects the symbiotic relationship seen in its evolved form. As a Baby Pokémon, Mantyke belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group. To obtain a Mantyke through breeding, a parent Mantine must hold the **Wave Incense** item; otherwise, the egg will hatch directly into a Mantine.
