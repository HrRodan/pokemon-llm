## Identity & Lore
Drakloak (Pokedex #886) is the Caretaker Pokémon, a dual-type Dragon and Ghost creature first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. This sleek, green predator is capable of achieving flight speeds exceeding 120 mph, though its most defining characteristic is its symbiotic relationship with its pre-evolved form, Dreepy. Drakloak carries a Dreepy on its head, doting on it and battling alongside it with fierce parental instinct until the younger Pokémon is strong enough to evolve. While Drakloak itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the middle stage of the Galar region's "Pseudo-Legendary" line, eventually maturing into the formidable stealth-bomber-inspired Dragapult. Its behavior suggests a high level of intelligence and social complexity, as it becomes deeply distressed and seeks out other Pokémon to care for if it loses its companion Dreepy.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 80, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 50, Speed 102.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker / Pivot. Its standout feature is its 102 Base Speed, which allows it to outpace the majority of unevolved Pokémon and many fully evolved threats.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, Fairy, Ghost, and Dark**. Conversely, it **resists Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Poison, and Bug**, and possesses two total **immunities to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Attack stat and high Speed, key moves include **Dragon Rush** (high-power STAB), **Phantom Force** (Ghost-type STAB that bypasses Protection), **U-turn** (to maintain offensive momentum as a pivot), and **Dragon Dance** (to further boost its Attack and Speed to sweeping levels).
* **Abilities:** **Clear Body** prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats, ensuring its Speed remains high. **Infiltrator** allows its attacks to bypass the effects of Reflect, Light Screen, and Substitute. **Cursed Body** (Hidden Ability) provides a 30% chance to disable a move that deals damage to it, providing a niche defensive utility.

## Evolution & Biology
Drakloak is part of a three-stage evolutionary line characterized by an exceptionally late maturity cycle. It evolves from **Dreepy** starting at **Level 50**, representing one of the highest level requirements for a first evolution in the Pokémon world. It remains in this form until it reaches **Level 60**, at which point it evolves into its final form, **Dragapult**. Biologically, it belongs to both the **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. Due to its "Slow" growth rate, Drakloak requires significant training and experience to reach its full potential, making it a late-game powerhouse for dedicated trainers.
