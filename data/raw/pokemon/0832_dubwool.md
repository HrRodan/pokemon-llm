## Identity & Lore
Dubwool (Pokedex #832) is the Sheep Pokémon, a majestic and sturdy quadrupedal creature first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Characterized by its massive, springy coat of white and black wool and its two pairs of impressive, curved horns, Dubwool is as functional as it is aesthetic. Its wool is so incredibly elastic that carpets woven from it act like trampolines, causing anyone who steps on them to bounce instantly. In the wild and on Galar's rolling farmlands, Dubwool serves as a leader to flocks of Wooloo, using its horns to fight off predators. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its remarkable durability and association with the Galar countryside make it a staple of the region's ecology.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 72, Attack 80, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 90, Speed 88.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Body Press Tank. With a base Defense of 100 and access to specific boosting moves, Dubwool excels at absorbing physical hits and retaliating with defense-based offense.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost**-type moves. It has no resistances to other elemental types.
* **Move Selection:** Dubwool’s kit is designed to weaponize its high physical bulk. Key moves include **Body Press** (which calculates damage using Defense instead of Attack), **Cotton Guard** (which drastically raises Defense to power up Body Press), **Double-Edge** (a high-power STAB move), and **Zen Headbutt** (to provide coverage against the Fighting-types it fears).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Fluffy:** Halves the damage taken from moves that make direct contact, but doubles the damage taken from Fire-type moves. This makes Dubwool an exceptional physical wall.
    * **Steadfast:** Boosts the Pokémon's Speed stat every time it flinches.
    * **Bulletproof (Hidden):** Grants total immunity to "ball" and "bomb" moves, such as Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast.

## Evolution & Biology
Dubwool is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Wooloo** once it reaches **Level 24**. Biologically, Dubwool are known for their stoic nature and their horns, which are primarily used to attract mates and intimidate rivals. Despite their bulky appearance, they are surprisingly nimble, as indicated by their respectable base Speed. They belong to the **Field** (Ground) egg group, and breeders typically look for a 15-cycle hatch counter to produce new Wooloo. Their growth rate is moderate, making them reliable partners for trainers journeying through the Galar league.
