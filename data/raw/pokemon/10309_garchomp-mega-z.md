## Identity & Lore
Garchomp-Mega-Z (Pokedex #10309) is the Mach Pokémon, a specialized and hyper-evolved form of the legendary Sinnoh-region apex predator. Originally discovered in Generation IV (Sinnoh), this specific Mega-Z variant represents the absolute pinnacle of aerodynamic efficiency, resembling a supersonic jet plane in flight. While the standard Garchomp is a Ground/Dragon type, this high-velocity Mega-Z form manifests as a pure Dragon-type, shedding its terrestrial weight to achieve sonic speeds. It is characterized by its sleek, blue bipedal frame and wing-like appendages that allow it to slice through the air with enough force to create vacuum blades. Beyond this form, Garchomp is globally recognized for its standard Mega Evolution and its capacity to dominate the competitive landscape as one of the most feared "Pseudo-Legendary" Pokémon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 108, Attack 130, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 141, Sp. Def 85, Speed 151.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a blistering Speed tier of 151, it outpaces almost the entire unboosted metagame, while its Special Attack higher than its physical power makes it an unconventional but terrifying ranged threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. As a pure Dragon-type, it provides critical **resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its massive Special Attack and unmatched speed, Garchomp-Mega-Z excels with moves such as **Draco Meteor** for overwhelming STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Dragon Pulse** for consistent accuracy, **Earth Power** to maintain its traditional coverage against Steel and Rock types, and **Fire Blast** to incinerate Steel-type walls that resist its primary attacks.
* **Abilities:** While this specialized form's specific ability is rare, it typically utilizes **Sand Force** (increasing power in Sandstorms) or **Rough Skin** (dealing contact damage to attackers) in its base form. Given its jet-like nature, it functions as a relentless offensive pivot.

## Evolution & Biology
Garchomp-Mega-Z is the final, temporary stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Gible**, a small but hardy dweller of caves like Wayward Cave in Sinnoh. Gible evolves into **Gabite** starting at Level 24. Gabite then matures into the formidable **Garchomp** at Level 48. The transition into the Mega-Z form is triggered through Mega Evolution, requiring a specific Mega Stone and a strong bond with its Trainer. Biologically, it is a member of the **Monster and Dragon Egg Groups**, characterized by a "Slow" growth rate, reflecting the immense time and effort required to train such a powerful creature to its maximum potential.
