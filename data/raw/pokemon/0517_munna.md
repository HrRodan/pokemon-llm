## Identity & Lore
Munna (Pokedex #517) is the Dream Eater Pokémon, a floating, pink, quadrupedal creature that first appeared in the Unova region during Generation V. Adorned with purple floral patterns, Munna is deeply connected to the realm of dreams; it is known to hover near the pillows of sleeping humans and Pokémon to feast on their dreams. When it consumes a pleasant dream, it exudes a glowing pink "Dream Mist," whereas nightmares are said to cause it distress. Historically, Munna serves as a precursor to the "Dream World" mechanics introduced in the Black and White era. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Musharna, is iconic for its association with the Fennel research lab and the manifestation of dreams into reality.

## Evolution & Biology
Munna is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Musharna when **exposed to a Moon Stone**. Biologically, Munna is closely related to the Drowzee line, though it is more benevolent, often helping people forget nightmares by consuming them. It belongs to the **Ground** (Field) egg group and has a fast growth rate, allowing it to reach its full potential quickly in a trainer's journey. In competitive "Little Cup" formats, Munna is often seen holding an **Eviolite** to drastically boost its Defense and Special Defense, making it a formidable tanky pivot.
