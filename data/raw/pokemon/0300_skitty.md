## Identity & Lore
Skitty (Pokedex #300) is the **Kitten Pokémon**, a Normal-type creature introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Characterized by its pink, quadrupedal form and large, sensitive ears, Skitty is primarily found in **forest** habitats. This Pokémon is renowned for its playful and easily distracted nature; it is instinctively fascinated by moving objects and will famously chase its own tail until it becomes dizzy. While Skitty does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it is a popular domestic Pokémon due to its affectionate temperament and "Cute" contest appeal.
