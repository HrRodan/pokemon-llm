## Identity & Lore
Loudred (Pokedex #294) is the Big Voice Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in dark caves, this blue, upright creature is defined by its massive, round ears which function as biological loudspeakers. Loudred possess the ability to inhale deeply and bellow with enough force to completely decimate a wood-frame house or overturn a truck. It uses this powerful voice to punish foes and assert dominance. While normally rowdy, its abdominal muscles are crucial for its sound production; if these muscles are weak or the Pokémon is exhausted, its voice becomes hoarse. It is known to stomp its feet intensely to build rhythm before letting out a massive cry.
