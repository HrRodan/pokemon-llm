## Identity & Lore
Bagon (Pokedex #371) is the Rock Head Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A small, blue, humanoid dragon found in rough terrain, its biology is defined by a genetic frustration; it dreams intensely of flying, practicing daily by leaping off cliffs. This repetitive impact strengthens its neck muscles and calcifies its skull, making its head as hard as steel. Bagon is the initial stage of a Pseudo-Legendary evolutionary line that culminates in the powerful Salamence. In the Paldea region, the Paradox Pokémon Roaring Moon bears a striking resemblance to a prehistoric version of the Salamence line.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 75, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 30, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It naturally **resists Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack stat and access to setup moves, key moves include **Dragon Dance** (for speed and power boosting), **Double-Edge** (high power), **Dragon Claw** (consistent STAB), and **Fire Fang** (coverage against Ice and Steel types).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Protects the Pokémon from recoil damage. This makes moves like Double-Edge exceptionally viable without the drawback of self-damage.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden Ability):** Removes additional effects to increase the power of moves when attacking.

## Evolution & Biology
Bagon is part of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Shelgon** starting at **Level 30**, enveloping itself in a hard shell to facilitate cellular mutation. It finally evolves into **Salamence** starting at **Level 50**, at which point its dream of growing wings is realized. Bagon belongs to the **Dragon** Egg Group and has a notably slow growth rate, requiring a Hatch Counter of 40. Rare specimens may be found holding a Dragon Scale or Dragon Fang.
