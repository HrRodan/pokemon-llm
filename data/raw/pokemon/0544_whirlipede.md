## Identity & Lore
Whirlipede (Pokedex #544) is the Curlipede Pokémon, first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This gray-colored, shell-bound Pokémon serves as the transitional stage between Venipede and its massive final evolution, Scolipede. Encased in a hard, protective exoskeleton, Whirlipede is typically motionless, storing energy for evolution; however, when threatened, it rotates its body at high speeds like a kinetic wheel to crash furiously into its enemies. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form of its own, it is the direct precursor to Scolipede, a Pokémon renowned for its aggressive competitive presence and sheer size in the wild habitats of the Unova and Kalos regions.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 55, Defense 99, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 79, Speed 47.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Entry Hazard Setter. Due to its high base Defense, it is most effective when holding an **Eviolite** to further boost its survivability.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Flying, Psychic, and Rock**. Conversely, it possesses significant defensive utility, with **Double Resistances (1/4x) to Fighting and Grass**, while also resisting **Bug, Fairy, and Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its shell-like appearance, Whirlipede utilizes its weight and speed-boosting potential to disrupt opponents. Key moves include **Poison Jab** (Physical STAB with a high poison chance), **Steamroller** (Physical STAB that can cause flinching), **Toxic Spikes** (crucial entry hazard for team support), and **Protect** (to safely accumulate Speed Boost stacks).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Poison Point:** May poison attackers that make direct contact, punishing physical sweepers.
    * **Swarm:** Increases the power of Bug-type moves by 50% when HP is low.
    * **Speed Boost (Hidden Ability):** A top-tier competitive ability that increases its Speed stat at the end of every turn, allowing Whirlipede to eventually outpace many threats despite its low base Speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Whirlipede is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Venipede** starting at Level 22. It remains in this armored form until it reaches **Level 30**, at which point it undergoes a massive growth spurt to become the predatory **Scolipede**. Biologically, Whirlipede acts similarly to a pupa or cocoon, though it is far more mobile than most Bug-type mid-stages. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and is often found in dark forests or industrial areas where it can blend into the shadows. Trainers looking to hatch a Venipede should note it has a hatch counter of 15, requiring a moderate amount of travel to produce an offspring.
