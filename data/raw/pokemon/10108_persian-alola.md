## Identity & Lore
Alolan Persian (Pokedex #10108) is the Classy Cat Pokémon, a regional Dark-type variant of the original Kanto Persian. While it is categorized under Generation I data due to its species origins, this specific form was first discovered in the Alola region. Known for its distinctively round face—a symbol of the rich Alola region's bounty—it was once protected by royalty. Its fur has many admirers for its high-class sheen, but it is notoriously difficult to raise as a pet due to its fickle meanness and tendency to look down on its Trainer. Though it primarily inhabits urban areas, its haughty demeanor and cruel battle tactics make it a formidable predator. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique biology in Alola has granted it defensive capabilities far beyond its standard counterpart.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Persian is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Alolan Meowth only when leveled up with **High Friendship (minimum 160 happiness)**. This is a departure from the Kantonian form, which evolves simply by reaching Level 28. Biologically, it is a quadruped mammal belonging to the **Ground** egg group. It has a hatch counter of 20, and its growth rate is categorized as medium. In competitive environments, it is often seen holding a **Quick Claw** or focus sash to augment its natural speed and disruption capabilities.
