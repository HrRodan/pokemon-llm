## Identity & Lore
Toucannon (#733) is the Cannon Pokémon, a striking avian species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. It is easily identified by its massive, multi-colored beak which functions as a high-heat combustion chamber. During battle, Toucannon can heat its beak to temperatures exceeding 212 degrees Fahrenheit, allowing it to ignite internal gases and launch seeds or specialized projectiles with explosive force. This thermal energy is so intense that it can cause severe burns to any opponent making physical contact. While Toucannon does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, it remains a dominant presence in tropical island ecosystems, often seen leading flocks of Pikipek and Trumbeak.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 120, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 75, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker. With an exceptional base 120 Attack, Toucannon is designed to break through sturdy physical walls, though it relies on its utility and signature mechanics to overcome its lower Speed.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It **resists Bug and Grass** and maintains a total **immunity to Ghost and Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Maximizing its high physical power and signature capabilities, key moves include **Beak Blast** (a unique charging move that burns any opponent making physical contact), **Brave Bird** (high-power STAB), **Rock Blast**, and **Bullet Seed**.
* **Abilities:** **Skill Link** allows multi-hit moves like Rock Blast to always hit the maximum number of times; **Keen Eye** prevents the Pokémon's accuracy from being lowered; **Sheer Force** (Hidden Ability) increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30% but removes those effects.

## Evolution & Biology
Toucannon is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Pikipek**, which evolves into **Trumbeak** starting at Level 14. The transformation into **Toucannon** is completed when Trumbeak reaches Level 28. Biologically, this Pokémon belongs to the **Flying** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15. Toucannon are known to be quite expressive, using their beaks to communicate with others through various clicking sounds and temperature changes. In the wild, they are occasionally found holding **Rawst Berries**, likely as a natural safeguard against the intense heat generated by their own beaks.
