## Identity & Lore
Orbeetle (Pokedex #826) is the Seven Spot Pokémon, a highly intelligent Bug and Psychic-type creature first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. It is famous for its massive brain size, which provides it with immense psychic power and a scientific level of intelligence. Its appearance, characterized by its red coloration and wing-like shell, resembles a ladybug blended with biomechanical UFO aesthetics. Orbeetle is known to use its psychic energy to scan its surroundings like a radar, sensing everything within a several-mile radius. While not listed in standard forms, Orbeetle possesses a notable Gigantamax form, where its body takes on the literal appearance of a massive flying saucer, capable of manipulating gravity to devastating effect.

## Evolution & Biology
Orbeetle is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Blipbug**, a sensitive larva that evolves into the radome-like **Dottler** upon reaching **Level 10**. Dottler then evolves into its final form, **Orbeetle**, starting at **Level 30**. Biologically, it is highly advanced, often observed hovering in place rather than walking. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, indicating a relatively standard breeding cycle for Galar’s native insectoid species.
