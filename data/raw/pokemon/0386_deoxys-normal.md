## Identity & Lore
Deoxys (Pokedex #386) is the enigmatic DNA Pokémon, a Mythical entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Born from the DNA of a space virus that underwent a sudden mutation upon exposure to a laser beam, Deoxys possesses a crystalline organ on its chest that functions as its brain and creates a highly intelligent, extraterrestrial consciousness. While this profile characterizes its **Normal Forme**, Deoxys is unique for its ability to shift its cellular structure into three other specialized states—Attack, Defense, and Speed Formes—typically by interacting with meteorites. It is often depicted as a rival to the Sky High Pokémon, Rayquaza, and is characterized by its red, humanoid appearance and ability to regenerate body parts.

*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its immense 150 base Attack and Special Attack, Deoxys functions best as a breaker using its signature move **Psycho Boost**, along with high-coverage moves like **Ice Beam**, **Thunderbolt**, and **Focus Blast** (or **Superpower** via transfer/tutor, though **Low Kick** is a viable alternative found in its current move pool).
*   **Abilities:** **Pressure** (Exerts pressure on the foe, forcing them to use 2 PP for every move efficiently targeted at Deoxys).

## Evolution & Biology
Deoxys is a stand-alone Mythical Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. However, it can change between its Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed Formes depending on the game mechanics (often interacting with meteorites). It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot be bred.
