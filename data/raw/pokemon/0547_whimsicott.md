## Identity & Lore
Whimsicott (#547) is the Windveiled Pokémon, a whimsical and mischievous creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its lightweight, humanoid green body and its voluminous mane of white cotton, it is a master of infiltration that can squeeze through the narrowest of cracks by riding on gusts of wind. According to Unovan folklore, it is a notorious prankster, appearing in homes to rearrange furniture or leave fluffy white cotton balls behind as evidence of its visit. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Whimsicott gained significant tactical relevance in Generation VI when it was reclassified from a pure Grass-type to a dual Grass/Fairy-type, granting it newfound mystical powers and a crucial immunity to Dragon-type attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Whimsicott is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cottonee** when the pre-evolution is exposed to a **Sun Stone**. Biologically, it is light enough to be carried by the strongest winds, though it will retreat to cover if it becomes wet, as its cotton mane absorbs water and becomes too heavy for flight. It belongs to both the **Plant** and **Fairy** Egg Groups, and while it is often found in forest or meadow habitats, it is frequently seen holding an **Absorb Bulb** in the wild, which boosts its Special Attack when hit by a Water-type move. It has a hatch counter of 20, indicating a relatively standard gestation period for species of its size and complexity.
