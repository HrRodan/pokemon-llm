## Identity & Lore
Deoxys-Speed (Pokedex #10003) is the Speed Forme of the DNA Pokémon, a Mythical entity that originated from a space virus. This extraterrestrial virus underwent a sudden, radical mutation after being exposed to a high-energy laser beam. As a resident of the Hoenn region (Generation III), it is recognized by its streamlined, aerodynamic physique and the glowing crystalline organ in its chest, which serves as its brain. While this specific form is optimized for sheer velocity, Deoxys is a highly adaptable life form known to shift between its Normal, Attack, and Defense Formes when exposed to specific meteorites found throughout the Pokémon world. Its alien biology allows it to achieve movement speeds that surpass almost every other known terrestrial Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Deoxys-Speed is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it is part of a unique multi-form system where it can reorganize its cellular structure to prioritize different combat attributes. While it cannot breed and belongs to the **No-Eggs** group, its biology is tied to extraterrestrial environments and radiation. It is often found in rare habitats or deep space and is highly sought after due to its low capture rate and mythical status. Its primary biological function is survival through rapid adaptation, which is reflected in its high base happiness and slow growth rate, indicating a complex and highly advanced consciousness.
