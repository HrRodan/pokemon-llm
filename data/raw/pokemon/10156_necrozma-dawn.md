## Identity & Lore
Dawn Wings Necrozma (Pokedex #10156) is the Prism Pokémon, a terrifyingly powerful life-form that represents Necrozma after it has forcibly fused with and taken control of the Legendary Pokémon Lunala. Originating from the Alola region (Generation VII), this form is considered a crystalline parasite that feeds on the light of others. Reminiscent of the Ultra Beasts, this black, light-absorbing entity is thought to have arrived from another dimension via Ultra Wormholes in ancient times. Beyond this fusion, Dawn Wings Necrozma possesses the potential to undergo **Ultra Burst** to become the radiant **Ultra Necrozma**, a form that regains its lost light and becomes one of the most powerful beings in existence.

## Evolution & Biology
Dawn Wings Necrozma is a unique legendary fusion rather than a standard evolution. It is formed when a base Necrozma uses the **N-Lunarizer** item to absorb **Lunala**. It does not evolve into any further stages naturally, though it can transform temporarily into **Ultra Necrozma** during battle. As a Legendary Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs** group and cannot be bred. Despite its heavy, 350.0kg frame, it maintains a spectral grace, hovering with the massive wings of the subdued Lunala.
