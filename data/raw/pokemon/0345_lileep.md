## Identity & Lore
Lileep (Pokedex #345) is the **Sea Lily Pokémon**, a prehistoric species originally discovered in the **Hoenn** region (Generation III). Resurrected from the **Root Fossil**, this ancient creature became extinct approximately 100 million years ago. Despite its plant-like appearance, Lileep is distinctively carnivorous; it anchors itself firmly to rocks on the seafloor using strong tentacles to avoid drifting in currents. It behaves like a crinoid, waving its flower-petal-shaped tentacles to disguise itself as aquatic flora, waiting to ensnare approaching prey to swallow whole.
