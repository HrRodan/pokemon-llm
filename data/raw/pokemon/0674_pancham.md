## Identity & Lore
Pancham (#674) is the Playful Pokémon, a mammalian species first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). This bipedal, panda-like creature is characterized by its white face and black fur around its eyes and limbs. Its most distinctive feature is its trademark green leaf, which it constantly chews to maintain a tough-looking facade. Despite its best efforts to be taken seriously and its attempts to intimidate enemies with a stern glare, its small stature and playful nature often make it more charming than threatening. While Pancham does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is known for its unique evolutionary requirement that reflects its transition into the more aggressive Pangoro.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 67, Attack 82, Defense 62, Sp. Atk 46, Sp. Def 48, Speed 43.

* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Bug, Rock, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its significant Attack stat and varied move pool, key moves include **Drain Punch** (for damage and sustain), **Sky Uppercut** (high-power STAB), **Crunch** (to counter Psychic-type weaknesses), and **Parting Shot** (a tactical switch-out move that lowers the opponent's offensive stats).
* **Abilities:** **Iron Fist** (boosts the power of punching moves by 20%), **Mold Breaker** (allows moves to be used regardless of the opponent's Ability), and **Scrappy** (Hidden Ability; allows it to hit Ghost-type Pokémon with Normal and Fighting-type moves).

## Evolution & Biology
Pancham is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the daunting Pangoro starting at Level 32, but only if the trainer has a **Dark-type Pokémon** in their party at the time of leveling up. This unique biological trigger mirrors the Pokémon's shift in temperament as it grows. Pancham is found in the **Ground** and **Humanshape** egg groups, with a hatch counter of 25. It is occasionally seen carrying a **Mental Herb**, which protects it from moves that limit its mental focus, such as Taunt.
