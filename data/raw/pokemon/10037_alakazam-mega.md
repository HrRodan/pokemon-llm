## Identity & Lore
Mega Alakazam (Pokedex #10037) is the Mega Evolved form of the Psi Pokémon, a creature whose biological evolution has been accelerated to reach the pinnacle of mental power. Originating from the Kanto region (Generation I), this brown, humanoid Pokémon undergoes a dramatic transformation upon Mega Evolution, shedding its physical strength for transcendental intellect. Its brain, which already out performs supercomputers with an IQ said to be 5,000, expands further, granting it the ability to perceive the past, present, and future simultaneously. While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution is considered one of the most potent displays of Psychic energy in the Pokémon world, characterized by its multiple floating silver spoons and a meditative, levitating posture.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 50, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 175, Sp. Def 105, Speed 150.
* **Archetype:** Elite Fast Special Sweeper. Mega Alakazam occupies a rare tier of Speed and Special Attack, allowing it to outpace nearly the entire unboosted metagame and deliver devastating one-hit KOs.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Psychic** type, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** types. Its lack of physical bulk makes it a "Glass Cannon," highly susceptible to physical priority moves like Sucker Punch or Pursuit.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its world-class Special Attack, Mega Alakazam excels with a moveset including **Psychic** (or Psyshock to hit physical walls), **Focus Blast** (to cover Dark and Steel-type weaknesses), **Shadow Ball** (to threaten opposing Ghost and Psychic types), and **Dazzling Gleam** (for Dragon and Dark-type coverage).
* **Abilities:** **Trace** (Upon entering battle, it copies the opponent's ability). This is a top-tier tactical ability, allowing Mega Alakazam to steal useful traits like Intimidate to soften physical hits, Flash Fire to absorb fire moves, or Swift Swim to outspeed opponents in their own weather.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Alakazam is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, achievable only through Mega Evolution. The cycle begins with **Abra**, which evolves into **Kadabra** starting at **Level 16**. Kadabra then evolves into **Alakazam** when **traded** between trainers. To reach its Mega form, an Alakazam must hold an **Alakazite** Mega Stone during combat. Biologically, its muscles have almost entirely atrophied, redirected into pure telekinetic energy that supports its body weight. It belongs to the **Humanshape** egg group and is typically found in urban habitats where it can best utilize its computational brain. Its growth rate is medium-slow, requiring significant experience to master its vast mental capabilities.
