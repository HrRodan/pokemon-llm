## Identity & Lore
Ralts (Pokedex #280) is the Feeling Pokémon, a sensitive humanoid creature first discovered in the Hoenn region during Generation III. Standing at only 0.4 meters, this white-bodied Pokémon is characterized by the green, hair-like mantle that masks its eyes and the distinct red horns on its head. These horns function as high-sensitivity sensors, allowing Ralts to read the emotional states of people and other Pokémon. It is known for its shy and elusive nature, rarely appearing before humans unless it detects a warm, positive disposition. While Ralts itself is diminutive, it holds immense potential, eventually branching into the powerful Gardevoir or Gallade, both of which are capable of **Mega Evolution**. Furthermore, its lineage is the inspiration for the futuristic Paradox Pokémon **Iron Valiant**, a robotic entity encountered in the Paldea region.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Synchronize:** If an opponent inflicts a status condition like burn, paralysis, or poison, Ralts passes that status back to the attacker.
    * **Trace:** Upon entering battle, Ralts copies the opponent's ability, potentially gaining powerful tactical advantages.
    * **Telepathy (Hidden):** Ralts anticipates and dodges moves used by its allies in double battles, making it an excellent partner in competitive formats.

## Evolution & Biology
Ralts is the first stage of a versatile three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Kirlia** upon reaching **Level 20**. From Kirlia, the path branches: it evolves into **Gardevoir** at **Level 30**, or if the Kirlia is male, it can evolve into the Psychic/Fighting-type **Gallade** when exposed to a **Dawn Stone**. Biologically, Ralts is categorized within both the **Human-like (Humanshape)** and **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** Egg Groups. It has a slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 20, reflecting the complexity of its emotional and psychic development. Its preferred habitats are urban environments where it can subtly interact with the emotions of passing residents.
