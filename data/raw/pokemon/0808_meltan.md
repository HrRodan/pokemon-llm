## Identity & Lore
Meltan (Pokedex #808) is the Hex Nut Pokémon, a unique Mythical Pokémon first discovered in the transition between Generation VII (Alola) and Generation VIII. This small, curious creature has a body composed primarily of liquid metal, allowing it to corrode and dissolve other metals to absorb them into its own mass. Its head is a golden hexagonal nut that floats freely above its fluid-like body. While it was introduced during the Alola era, it is most famously associated with the Kanto region through its debut in *Pokémon Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!* via *Pokémon GO*. Though Meltan itself is small and relatively fragile, it holds the distinction of being the only Mythical Pokémon capable of evolution, eventually becoming the titanous Melmetal—a Pokémon that possesses a colossal Gigantamax form capable of using the devastating move G-Max Meltdown.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 46, Attack 65, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 35, Speed 34.
* **Archetype:** Low-Speed Physical Trapper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Fighting, and Ground**. As a pure Steel-type, it provides excellent defensive utility, **resisting Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy** types, and it is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its small size, Meltan can utilize its metallic composition for heavy hits. Capitalizing on its stats and low Speed, key moves include **Gyro Ball** (which deals more damage the slower the user is compared to the target), **Flash Cannon** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Steel Beam** for a high-intensity finishing move, and **Thunderbolt** for elemental coverage against Water and Flying types.
* **Abilities:** Magnet Pull (Prevents opposing Steel-type Pokémon from switching out or fleeing, allowing Meltan to trap and chip away at specific defensive threats).

## Evolution & Biology
Meltan is part of a two-stage evolutionary line and is remarkably unique for a Mythical Pokémon. It evolves into Melmetal, but only through a specific biological trigger: it requires the accumulation of a massive amount of metal energy, represented as 400 Meltan Candies in *Pokémon GO*. In its liquid state, Meltan can generate electricity using the metal it absorbs, which it uses both as a source of energy and as a means of defense. It belongs to the No Eggs Discovered group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its "Slow" growth rate, it is a highly sought-after specimen for its rarity and its eventual transformation into one of the heaviest and most physically imposing Pokémon in existence.
