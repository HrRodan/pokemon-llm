## Identity & Lore
Bibarel (Pokédex #400) is the industrious Beaver Pokémon, native to the **Sinnoh** region (Generation IV). Distinguished by its dual **Normal/Water** typing and dark brown fur, this creature is renowned for its engineering capabilities, creating complex nests by damming streams with bark and mud. While often found near rivers and lakes, Bibarel is famously recognized by trainers as a versatile travel companion due to its ability to master various field skills. It does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms.

    *   **Unaware:** Ignores the attacking or defending Pokémon's stat changes during battle.
    *   **Moody (Hidden):** Sharply raises one random stat and lowers another at the end of every turn, creating chaotic but potentially overwhelming stat distributions.
