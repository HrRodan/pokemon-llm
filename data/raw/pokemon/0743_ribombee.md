## Identity & Lore
Ribombee (#743) is the Bee Fly Pokémon, a small and highly agile species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. Standing at only 0.2 meters, this yellow insectoid creature is renowned for its ability to process nectar and pollen into specialized "Pollen Puffs." These puffs are versatile tools; some are highly nutritious and sold as supplements, while others are used in battle to paralyze or damage opponents. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form, it is famous in its home region for being a powerful Totem Pokémon encountered in the Lush Jungle. Its design is a unique blend of a bee fly and a fairy-like sprite, reflecting its dual Bug and Fairy typing.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 55, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 70, Speed 124.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Entry Hazard Lead.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Rock, Fire, Poison, and Steel**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, Bug, Grass, and Dark**, and possesses a total **immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Ribombee excels by using its top-tier Speed to set the pace of the match. Key moves include **Moonblast** for powerful Fairy STAB, **Bug Buzz** to bypass Substitutes, **Sticky Web** to provide essential speed control for the team, and **Quiver Dance**, which allows it to boost its Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed simultaneously to become a dangerous sweeper. **Pollen Puff** is also a signature choice, especially in doubles, as it can damage enemies or heal allies.
* **Abilities:** **Shield Dust** is its most competitive trait, protecting Ribombee from the secondary effects of moves (such as being flinched by Fake Out or burned by Scald). **Honey Gather** allows it to find Honey after battle, and its Hidden Ability, **Sweet Veil**, prevents Ribombee and its allies from falling asleep.

## Evolution & Biology
Ribombee is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cutiefly** once it reaches **Level 25**. Biologically, it is extremely lightweight at 0.5 kg, allowing it to flutter with such precision that it can dodge raindrops while flying through a storm. It belongs to both the **Bug and Fairy Egg Groups**, and its breeding cycles are relatively standard with a hatch counter of 20. In the wild, Ribombee are often found near flower fields where they collect the high-quality pollen required to create the different varieties of puffs they carry in their pouches. Consistent with its lore, it is frequently found holding **Honey** when encountered.
