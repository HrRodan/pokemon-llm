## Identity & Lore
Blue-Striped Basculin (Pokedex #10016) is the Hostile Pokémon, a specialized variant of the species first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Characterized by its sleek green body and distinct blue lateral stripe, this aquatic Pokémon is legendary for its extreme aggression. It is often locked in violent territorial disputes with its Red-Striped counterparts; the two forms are so mutually antagonistic that they will begin fighting the moment they see one another. While it is primarily found in the lakes and rivers of Unova, its lineage has deep historical roots. In the ancient Hisui region, a separate White-Striped variant was discovered with the unique ability to evolve, a trait traditionally absent in the Blue and Red forms found in modern times. Despite its lack of a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Basculin is respected by fishers as a fierce fighter that refuses to back down.

## Evolution & Biology
Basculin-Blue-Striped is part of a two-stage evolutionary line, though its ability to transition is historically rare. According to recent biological records, it evolves into **Basculegion** when it accumulates a significant amount of **recoil damage** (roughly 294 HP) without fainting. This evolution was first documented in the Hisui region, where the souls of fallen schoolmates were said to possess Basculin that survived harsh journeys upstream. Basculin belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and is known to be quite difficult to catch due to its hostile nature. In the wild, it is sometimes found carrying a **Deep Sea Scale**, an item that enhances the defensive capabilities of certain other fish-like Pokémon.
