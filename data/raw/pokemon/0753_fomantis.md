## Identity & Lore
Fomantis (Pokedex #753) is the Sickle Grass Pokémon, first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This small, pink, plant-like Pokémon is renowned for its fascinating nocturnal behavior and its mimicry of insectoid features. Standing only 0.3 meters tall, Fomantis spends its daylight hours in a deep slumber, spreading its leaves wide to absorb sunlight for photosynthesis. This solar energy is critical for its growth and for achieving the vibrant coloration of its evolution. When night falls, it becomes active, prowling through the lush jungles of Alola to find a safe, new location to rest before the sun rises again. While Fomantis itself does not possess Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its evolution, Lurantis, is famously known as a formidable Totem Pokémon in the Lush Jungle of Akala Island. Its biology is a clever inversion of nature; while it resembles an orchid mantis (an insect mimicking a flower), Fomantis is actually a plant mimicking an insect to deter predators.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 55, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 35, Speed 35.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Technical Attacker. While its base stats are humble as an unevolved Pokémon, its access to high-power moves and a specific hidden ability gives it niche viability.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its balanced offensive stats and its unique ability, key moves include **Leaf Blade** (high-crit physical STAB), **Leaf Storm** (used in tandem with Contrary to boost Special Attack), **Synthesis** (essential recovery fueled by its solar-gathering lore), and **X-Scissor** (insect-mimicry coverage to handle other Grass and Psychic types).
* **Abilities:** **Leaf Guard** prevents status conditions in harsh sunlight. Its Hidden Ability, **Contrary**, is its most competitive asset, causing all stat changes to be reversed (e.g., using Leaf Storm increases Special Attack by two stages instead of lowering it).

## Evolution & Biology
Fomantis is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Lurantis when **leveled up to at least Level 34 during the daytime**, a process that requires the vast amounts of solar energy it stores as a Fomantis. Biologically, it is highly sensitive to the environment, often found holding a **Miracle Seed** to boost its chlorophyll-based power. It belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group, and breeders typically expect a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. Despite its delicate appearance, the "sickles" on its arms are surprisingly sharp, used both for cutting through thick undergrowth and for defending itself against those who disturb its daytime sleep.
