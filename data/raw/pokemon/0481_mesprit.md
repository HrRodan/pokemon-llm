## Identity & Lore
Mesprit (Pokédex #481) is the Legendary **Emotion Pokémon** introduced in Generation IV (**Sinnoh**). Recognized as "The Being of Emotion," this small, pink, levitating Pokémon is one member of the **Lake Guardians** trio, residing in Lake Verity. According to Sinnoh myths, Mesprit taught humans the nobility of sorrow, pain, and joy; it is said that when Mesprit first flew, humans learned the ability to feel emotions. Unlike its counterparts Uxie and Azelf, Mesprit is known for its playful yet elusive nature, often roaming the region rather than staying in its cavern. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a key figure in the creation myths involving Dialga and Palkia.
