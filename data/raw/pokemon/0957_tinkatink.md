## Identity & Lore
Tinkatink (Pokedex #957) is the Metalsmith Pokémon, a diminutive pink humanoid creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Standing at only 0.4 meters, it is easily recognized by the crude, handmade hammer it carries, which it forges itself by smashing scraps of metal. Tinkatink's life is defined by a constant struggle for survival; its flavor text reveals a poignant ecological niche where its precious hammer is frequently stolen by metal-consuming predators like Pawniard or Orthworm. Despite its vulnerable appearance, it is remarkably industrious and will relentlessly swing its iron tool to ward off threats. While Tinkatink does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the initial stage of an evolutionary line that culminates in the formidable Tinkaton, a Pokémon known for its massive hammer and aggressive rivalry with Corviknight.

## Evolution & Biology
Tinkatink is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Tinkatuff** upon reaching **Level 24**, and finally into the powerful **Tinkaton** starting at **Level 38**. Throughout its biological development, the size and complexity of its hammer grow alongside its strength and confidence. Tinkatink belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group. Biologically, it is noted for its pink coloration and its humanoid shape, spending much of its time in rocky or industrial areas where scrap metal is abundant for its smithing needs.
