## Identity & Lore
Flabébé (Pokedex #669) is the Single Bloom Pokémon, a tiny and delicate Fairy-type first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. Standing at a mere 0.1 meters and weighing only 0.1 kilograms, it is one of the smallest and lightest Pokémon in existence. Upon birth, a Flabébé searches for a flower to protect and cherish for the rest of its life, eventually drawing out and controlling the hidden natural power within the bloom. This flower is essentially considered an extension of the Pokémon's own body. Flabébé is unique for its five distinct floral colorations—Red, Yellow, Orange, Blue, and White—which determine the appearance of its entire evolutionary line. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Florges, is renowned as one of the most formidable Special walls in competitive play.

## Evolution & Biology
Flabébé is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Floette** upon reaching Level 19. To reach its final and most powerful form, **Florges**, a Floette must be exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. Biologically, Flabébé is an all-female species and belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group. Despite its appearance, it is not a Grass-type, though its symbiotic relationship with its flower allows it to learn numerous plant-based moves like Vine Whip, Solar Beam, and Petal Blizzard. Collectors often seek out the rare "White Flower" and "Orange Flower" variants, as these colors are less common in the wild meadows of the Pokémon world.
