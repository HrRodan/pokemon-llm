## Identity & Lore
Tapu Koko (Pokedex #785) is the Land Spirit Pokémon and the legendary guardian deity of Melemele Island in the Alola region (Generation VII). This yellow-hued protector is known for its fickle and mercurial nature; while it is brimming with curiosity and may appear to help people and other Pokémon, it is also known for a short temper and a sudden, violent streak when provoked. Physically, it is characterized by the large, mask-like shells on its arms that it can close together to form the head of a predatory bird, a form it assumes when storing lightning or utilizing its signature Z-Move, **Guardian of Alola**. Unlike many other legendaries, Tapu Koko does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, but its ability to manipulate terrain makes it a cornerstone of the Alolan mythos and competitive ecosystem.

## Combat Profile

Despite its lower Special Attack, **Volt Switch** and **Dazzling Gleam** remain viable for tactical flexibility.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Electric Surge:** Automatically summons Electric Terrain upon entering battle, which prevents Pokémon from falling asleep and boosts the power of Electric-type moves for all grounded combatants.
    * **Telepathy (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from damage taken from its allies' moves in Double Battles, such as Earthquake or Discharge.

## Evolution & Biology
Tapu Koko is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of any evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species. As a member of the "No Eggs" group, it cannot be bred. Biologically, it is designed for high-intensity bursts of speed, as evidenced by its base 130 Speed stat, allowing it to outpace the vast majority of non-Legendary Pokémon. It sustains its immense power by summoning thunderclouds and storing the harvested electricity directly within its body. Its presence is often heralded by the smell of ozone and the crackling of static in the Alolan air.
