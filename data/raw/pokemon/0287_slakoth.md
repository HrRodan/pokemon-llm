## Identity & Lore
Slakoth (Pokedex #287) is the Slacker Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Generation III (Hoenn)** region. This brown, quadrupedal mammal is defined by its extreme lethargy; it spends over twenty hours a day sleeping and moves very little to conserve energy. Its metabolic rate is so slow that its sole daily meal consists of just three leaves. While often found in **forests**, Slakoth's heartbeat is imperceptibly slow, allowing it to remain virtually motionless without strain. Despite its laziness, it is the first stage of a powerful evolutionary line that eventually rivals legendary Pokémon in raw strength.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 35, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Hindered Physical Tank / Little Cup Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Normal-type**, it is **weak to Fighting** and **immune to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its decent Attack and Defense, Slakoth utilizes a physical moveset mixed with recovery. Key moves include:
    *   **Body Slam** (Reliable STAB damage with a chance to paralyze).
    *   **Play Rough** (Coverage against Fighting and Dark types).
    *   **Hammer Arm** or **Gunk Shot** (High-power physical coverage).
    *   **Slack Off** (Signature recovery move to restore HP).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Truant:** The Pokémon can only use a move every other turn. This is a detrimental ability that defines Slakoth's playstyle, often forcing trainers to use "Hit and Run" tactics or rely on its bulk to survive the loafing turns.

## Evolution & Biology
Slakoth is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Vigoroth** starting at **Level 18**, gaining a massive boost in energy and speed. Vigoroth subsequently evolves into the mighty **Slaking** starting at **Level 36**. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a slow growth rate, requiring patience to raise.
