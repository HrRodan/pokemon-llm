## Identity & Lore
Darmanitan (Pokedex #555) is the Blazing Pokémon, a powerful quadrupedal creature whose internal fire burns at an incredible 2,500° F. This intense heat provides it with enough physical strength to destroy a dump truck with a single punch. Primarily discovered in the Unova region during Generation V, this Pokémon is easily recognized by its vibrant red fur and its constant, wide-eyed grin. While this profile focuses on its Standard form, Darmanitan is famous for its biological versatility; it possesses a unique **Zen Mode** that transforms its appearance and typing, and it also has a distinct **Galarian Form** (Ice-type) found in the Galar region. In its standard state, it is a creature of pure physical aggression, often found in arid environments where its internal heat can burn unchecked.

## Evolution & Biology
Darmanitan is the second and final stage of its evolutionary line. It evolves from **Darumaka** once it reaches **Level 35**. While the Unovian (Standard) form evolves via leveling, the Galarian variant requires exposure to an Ice Stone to reach its final form. Biologically, Darmanitan is a member of the **Field (Ground)** egg group, and its eggs have a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. Despite its bulky appearance, it is remarkably agile, often using its powerful arms to propel itself across the battlefield. Its physiological state is entirely dependent on its emotional and physical temperature; if its flame flickers, it retreats into a statue-like state to meditate and recover its energy.
