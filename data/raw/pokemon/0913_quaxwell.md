## Identity & Lore
Quaxwell (Pokedex #913) is the Practicing Pokémon, a dedicated and hardworking Water-type introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). Standing at 1.2 meters, this bipedal, blue avian Pokémon is characterized by its intense focus on physical conditioning and aesthetic discipline. According to Paldean lore, Quaxwell are known to constantly run through shallow waters to strengthen their lower bodies, frequently engaging in competitive displays to see which individual can execute kicks with the most grace and precision. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Quaxwell represents the transitional stage toward the flamboyant and formidable Quaquaval. Its obsession with cleanliness, inherited from its pre-evolution Quaxly, persists as it maintains its sleek plumage even during rigorous training.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 85, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 60, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Mid-Stage Attacker. While its stats are balanced for a middle evolution, its focus lies clearly in its physical prowess.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** type attacks, making it relatively durable against common elemental threats.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Attack stat and training-focused moveset, Quaxwell excels with moves such as **Aqua Cutter** (high critical-hit ratio), **Liquidation** (chance to lower Defense), **Aqua Jet** (essential priority for finishing weakened foes), and **Brave Bird** (high-power Flying coverage for Grass-type counters).
* **Abilities:** **Torrent** increases the power of Water-type moves by 50% when Quaxwell's HP is low, a standard but effective survival tool. Its Hidden Ability, **Moxie**, is its competitive highlight, boosting its Attack stat every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to potentially snowball into a powerful sweeper if managed correctly.

## Evolution & Biology
Quaxwell is the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from the Water-type starter **Quaxly** starting at **Level 16**. Through continued training and refinement of its dance-like combat style, it eventually evolves into its final form, **Quaquaval**, upon reaching **Level 36**. Biologically, Quaxwell belongs to both the **Flying** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, reflecting its avian physiology and aquatic habitat. Its medium-slow growth rate suggests it requires steady experience to reach its full potential as a premier Paldean combatant. Despite its bird-like appearance, its primary method of interaction and defense remains its powerful, well-trained legs.
