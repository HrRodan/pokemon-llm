## Identity & Lore
Dudunsparce (Pokedex #982) is the Land Snake Pokémon, a notable evolution of the long-reclusive Dunsparce introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This particular variation is the "Two-Segment Form," characterized by its elongated, yellow, serpentine body divided into two distinct sections. Its biology is centered around subterranean excavation; Dudunsparce uses its hardened, drill-like tail to bore through solid bedrock deep underground to create sprawling nests that can reach lengths of over six miles. While this form is the most common, world knowledge indicates a rare "Three-Segment Form" can occasionally occur during evolution, though both forms share the same formidable physical presence and characteristic drill-tail.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 125, Attack 100, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 75, Speed 55.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker / Status Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost**.
* **Move Selection:** Dudunsparce excels when utilizing its high HP and Attack stat. Key moves include **Hyper Drill**, its signature move which bypasses protective barriers like Protect; **Body Slam**, which pairs perfectly with its ability to spread paralysis; **Coil**, a powerful setup move that raises Attack, Defense, and Accuracy; and **Roost**, which provides essential recovery to capitalize on its massive base 125 HP.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Serene Grace:** Doubles the chance of moves' secondary effects occurring (e.g., increasing Body Slam's paralysis rate to 60%).
    * **Run Away:** Ensures a certain escape from wild Pokémon encounters.
    * **Rattled (Hidden Ability):** Boosts the Speed stat by one stage when hit by Bug-, Ghost-, or Dark-type moves, or when intimidated.

## Evolution & Biology
Dudunsparce is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Dunsparce** only when it **levels up while knowing the move Hyper Drill** (usually learned at Level 32). The number of segments it possesses upon evolution is determined by its internal nature, with the Two-Segment form being the standard result. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and is known for its "squiggle" body shape. Despite its unassuming appearance, its ability to survive in deep subterranean habitats makes it a resilient and hardy species.
