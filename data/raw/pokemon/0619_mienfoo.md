## Identity & Lore
Mienfoo (Pokedex #619) is the Martial Arts Pokémon, first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its small, ermine-like stature and yellow fur with red accents, Mienfoo is a dedicated practitioner of fluid martial arts. Its movements are described as an onslaught of flowing, continuous attacks, often utilizing its sharp claws to cut enemies with surgical precision. Despite its elegant appearance, it is a fierce combatant that prides itself on speed and rhythm. While Mienfoo does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its evolved form, Mienshao, is renowned across the Pokémon world as one of the most graceful and dangerous high-speed physical sweepers.

    * **Inner Focus:** Prevents the Pokémon from flinching, making it a reliable lead against "Fake Out" users.
    * **Regenerator:** Restores 1/3 of the Pokémon's maximum HP upon switching out, providing incredible longevity for a pivot-based playstyle.
    * **Reckless (Hidden Ability):** Increases the power of moves that have recoil or crash damage, significantly boosting the lethality of its High Jump Kick.

## Evolution & Biology
Mienfoo is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It undergoes a significant physical transformation into **Mienshao** starting at **Level 50**, which is one of the highest level-up requirements for a non-pseudo-legendary Pokémon. Biologically, Mienfoo belongs to both the **Field (Ground)** and **Human-Like (Humanshape)** Egg Groups, reflecting its animalistic features and its humanoid, disciplined combat style. Its hatch counter of 25 cycles suggests a moderate breeding difficulty. It is often found in mountainous or rocky terrain where it can train its reflexes in solitude.
