## Identity & Lore
Cosmog (Pokedex #789) is the Nebula Pokémon, a legendary creature of extraterrestrial origin first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This unique entity is composed of a gaseous, frail blue body that is so light it can be easily blown away by the wind. Despite its delicate appearance, it is known to absorb dust from the atmosphere to grow, eventually manifesting incredible cosmic power. In Alolan lore, it was historically known as the "Child of the Stars." 

Cosmog played a pivotal role in the Alola crisis, specifically through an individual nicknamed "Nebby" who sought protection within the bag of Lillie. While Cosmog itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the only Legendary Pokémon capable of evolving into other Legendaries—specifically the mascots of the sun and moon. Furthermore, its final evolutions can undergo "Ultra Burst" or fuse with the Paradox-adjacent entity Necrozma to become Dusk Mane or Dawn Wings Necrozma.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 43, Attack 29, Defense 31, Sp. Atk 29, Sp. Def 31, Speed 37.
* **Archetype:** Passive Utility / Non-Combatant. Due to its exceptionally low base stats and near-total lack of offensive moves, it serves primarily as a lore-centric bridge to its powerful evolutions.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Psychic type**, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic**.
* **Move Selection:** Cosmog has a remarkably restricted movepool, focusing entirely on evasion and survival. Key moves include **Teleport** (for switching out of danger), **Cosmic Power** (to boost its defenses), and **Splash**.
* **Abilities:** Unaware (This ability allows Cosmog to ignore the opponent's stat changes when taking damage, providing a niche layer of defensive utility by negating enemy boosts).

## Evolution & Biology
Cosmog is the first stage of a three-stage Legendary evolutionary line, a rarity among high-tier Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group and cannot be bred. Its biological growth is marked by a significant increase in density as it progresses through its life cycle:

1. **Cosmog** evolves into **Cosmoem** starting at **Level 43**. 
2. **Cosmoem** then undergoes a final transformation at **Level 53** based on the cosmic energy it is exposed to (governed by the specific game version or celestial conditions). It evolves into **Solgaleo** (the Sunne Pokémon) in *Pokémon Sun, Ultra Sun, or Sword*, or into **Lunala** (the Moone Pokémon) in *Pokémon Moon, Ultra Moon, or Shield*. 

Physically, Cosmog is one of the lightest Pokémon in existence, weighing only 0.1 kg, reflecting its gaseous nebula-like composition. It lacks a visible skeleton, consisting mostly of gases held together by a mysterious golden orbital structure.
