## Identity & Lore
Alolan Graveler (Pokedex #10110) is the Alolan variant of the Rock Pokémon, originally discovered in the Kanto region but adapted to the volcanic and magnetic environments of Generation VII (Alola). Unlike its brown, mountainous counterparts, Alolan Graveler is characterized by its dark, rocky hide covered in patches of black dross and magnetic iron sand. It thrives in mountainous habitats where it feeds on drites and minerals, particularly those rich in electricity. Known to roll down slopes with unstoppable momentum, it ignores obstacles in its path, creating thunderous booms as it moves. While Graveler itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Alolan Golem, is renowned for its massive "railgun" stone-firing capabilities.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 95, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 45, Speed 35.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Attacker. With a high base Defense and respectable Attack, Alolan Graveler excels at trading blows with physical strikers, though its low Speed and Special Defense make it vulnerable to special sweepers.
* **Type Matchups:** It possesses a unique Rock/Electric typing. It is **weak to Water, Grass, and Fighting**, and has a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**. Conversely, it **resists Normal, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Electric-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its high physical Attack, Alolan Graveler's kit is most effective with **Stone Edge** for high-crit Rock STAB, **Wild Charge** or **Supercell Slam** for Electric-type pressure, **Earthquake** for necessary coverage against opposing Steel and Electric types, and **Explosion** to deal massive sacrificial damage.
* **Abilities:** **Magnet Pull** (Prevents Steel-type Pokémon from switching out, making it a "trapper"), **Sturdy** (Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full HP), and its Hidden Ability **Galvanize** (Converts Normal-type moves into Electric-type moves and boosts their power by 20%, granting it incredibly powerful Electric-type Double-Edge or Explosion attacks).

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Graveler is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Alolan Geodude** starting at **Level 25**. To reach its final form, **Alolan Golem**, Alolan Graveler must be **traded** to another trainer, a process that triggers its final metamorphosis. Biologically, it belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, reflecting its dense, rocky composition. In the wild, it is often found carrying a **Cell Battery**, which it uses to store excess electrical energy gathered from its environment. Its diet consisting of electrified minerals is what causes the growth of the black crystals and magnetic fur-like dross found on its body.
