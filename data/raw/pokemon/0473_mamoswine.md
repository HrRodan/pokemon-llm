## Identity & Lore
Mamoswine (Pokedex #473) is the imposing Twin Tusk Pokémon, a massive mammalian creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Resembling a woolly mammoth crossed with a boar, Mamoswine possesses impressive tusks made of solid ice, which are smaller in females than in males. Historically, this species flourished during the ice age, but its population thinned significantly as the climate warmed. It is an ancient Pokémon often found frozen in permafrost, and its reawakening is linked to deeply buried memories of the past. Mamoswine represents the apex of the Swinub evolutionary line, gaining tremendous size and power compared to its predecessors.

## Evolution & Biology
Mamoswine is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Swinub**, which evolves into **Piloswine** starting at level 33. Piloswine can only evolve into Mamoswine when leveled up while knowing the move **Ancient Power**. This evolution represents a reawakening of ancient genes. It belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group and has a base hatch counter of 20 cycles.
