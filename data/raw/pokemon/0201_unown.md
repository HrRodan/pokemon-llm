## Identity & Lore
Unown (Pokedex #201) is the mysterious **Symbol Pokémon**, first discovered in the **Johto** region (Generation II). Resembling ancient writing, this Psychic-type possesses a flat, black body heavily associated with the **Ruins of Alph** and other archaeological sites. Unown is unique for having **28 distinct forms**, corresponding to the 26 letters of the Latin alphabet plus the exclamation and question marks. Academic debate persists within the Pokémon world regarding whether Unown preceded ancient writing or if they appeared as a reaction to it. While individually weak, lore suggests that when Unown gather in large numbers, they possess the power to warp reality and create Entei-like illusions.

*   **Move Selection:** Unown is restricted to a single move in its entire repertoire. Its combat effectiveness relies entirely on **Hidden Power**, a move that changes type based on the individual's specific characteristics (IVs), allowing for unpredictable coverage against specific threats.

## Evolution & Biology
Unown is a non-evolving Pokémon that does not belong to any evolutionary chain. It is a single-stage entity with no pre-evolution or subsequent forms. Unown falls into the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot breed or produce eggs at the Pokémon Day Care; it must be caught in the wild, typically within ancient ruins. Its growth rate is medium, and it is genderless.
