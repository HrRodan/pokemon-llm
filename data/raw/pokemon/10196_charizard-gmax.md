## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Charizard (Pokedex #10196) is the massive, empowered Gigantamax form of the Flame Pokémon. While Charizard originated in the Kanto region (Generation I), this specific Gigantamax manifestation was first discovered in the Galar region. In this form, its wings have transformed into capes of living fire, and its internal temperature has increased to the point where it constantly spits flames capable of melting solid boulders. Beyond its Galar-exclusive Gigantamax form, Charizard is one of the few Pokémon known to possess two distinct Mega Evolutions (Mega Charizard X and Y) and has recently been seen utilizing the Terastal phenomenon in Paldea. It is frequently found in mountainous habitats and is notoriously high-spirited, seeking out powerful opponents to test its flames.

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Charizard is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Charmander**, which evolves into **Charmeleon** starting at Level 16. Charmeleon then evolves into **Charizard** starting at Level 36. To achieve the Gigantamax form, a Charizard must possess the **Gigantamax Factor**, often obtained through Max Raid Battles or by consuming Max Soup in the Isle of Armor. It belongs to the **Monster and Dragon** Egg Groups, making it a versatile candidate for breeding high-IV competitive sets. Despite its draconic appearance and "Dragon" egg group, it only gains the Dragon typing when Mega Evolving into Mega Charizard X.
