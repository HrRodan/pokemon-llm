## Identity & Lore
Mega Latios (Pokedex #10063) is the Mega Evolved form of the legendary Eon Pokémon, originally discovered in the Hoenn region (Generation III). Appearing as a streamlined, jet-plane-like creature with a purple-and-white color palette, this transformation represents Latios’s full potential realized through the power of a Latiosite Mega Stone. It is a highly intelligent being capable of understanding human speech and projecting telepathic images into the minds of others. Known to frequent the waters-edge and soar through the skies at speeds faster than a jet, Mega Latios is a guardian of the "Soul Dew." While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its ability to "Soar" in the Hoenn skies remains its most distinctive ecological trait, often seen alongside its counterpart, Latias.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Latios is a temporary evolutionary stage of Latios, a standalone Legendary Pokémon that does not evolve into or from any other species. The transformation is triggered in battle when Latios holds a **Latiosite**. It is the male counterpart to Latias; together they form the "Eon Duo." Biologically, it is categorized in the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its biology is optimized for high-speed flight, featuring a tucked-wing "shape" that reduces air resistance. Despite its combat ferocity, its nature is described as gentle, preferring to hide its presence by using its feathers to refract light and become invisible rather than engaging in unnecessary conflict.
