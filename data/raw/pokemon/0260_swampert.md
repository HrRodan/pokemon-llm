Renowned for its immense physical strength, Swampert possesses the power to easily drag a boulder weighing more than a ton and can batter down foes with its rock-hard arms. Its vision is exceptionally keen, allowing it to see clearly even in the murky waters of its natural **waters-edge** habitat. While not listed in its standard forms, Swampert is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Swampert using the Swampertite, where it gains the Swift Swim ability and significantly increased bulk.
