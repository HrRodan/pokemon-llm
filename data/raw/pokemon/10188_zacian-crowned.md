## Identity & Lore
Crowned Sword Zacian (Pokedex #10188) is the Warrior Pokémon, a legendary figure hailing from the Galar region (Generation VIII). In this "Crowned" form, Zacian absorbs metal particles to manifest a golden sword in its mouth, transforming from its "Hero of Many Battles" state into a regal and formidable combatant. According to Galarian lore, Zacian is the elder sister of Zamazenta, and together they are known as the Heroes of Many Battles who saved the region from the Darkest Day. This quadrupedal, blue-furred deity is often described as a "Legendary Hero" that can cut through anything with a single strike of its blade. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, this Crowned state is essentially its peak power level, granted only when it holds the Rusted Sword artifact.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 92, Attack 150, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 115, Speed 148.
*   **Archetype:** Legendary Physical Sweeper / Revenge Killer.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a **Fairy/Steel** type, Zacian-Crowned possesses one of the strongest defensive profiles in the game. It is **weak to Fire and Ground**. However, it boasts a massive list of resistances, including **Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Rock, and Dark**, while having a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**. Most notably, it is **Immune to Poison and Dragon** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Zacian-Crowned relies on its overwhelming Attack and Speed. Its signature utility comes from **Iron Head** (which transforms into the devastating **Behemoth Blade** in this form), **Play Rough** for Fairy-type STAB, **Close Combat** to dismantle opposing Steel types, and **Swords Dance** to reach Tier-0 offensive pressure.
*   **Abilities:** **Intrepid Sword** (When this Pokémon enters a battle, its Attack stat is raised by one stage). This effectively gives Zacian a free "Choice Band" boost without the move-locking drawback, making it an immediate threat the moment it hits the field.

## Evolution & Biology
Zacian is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. However, it undergoes a **Form Change** when entering battle while holding the **Rusted Sword** item. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its graceful appearance, its biology is geared entirely toward warfare; its 355kg weight and high-density metal armor allow it to move at speeds exceeding 140 base points (Speed), making it one of the fastest threats in the history of the Pokémon world. Its slow growth rate reflects its status as an ancient, high-investment guardian of the Galar region.
