## Identity & Lore
Drednaw (Pokedex #834) is the Bite Pokémon, a formidable and highly aggressive reptilian predator first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Known for its rugged, green-and-brown shell and a sharp, serrated horn on its head, Drednaw possesses jaws powerful enough to shear through steel rods with ease. It is notorious for its temperamental nature, often requiring a highly skilled Trainer to keep its aggression in check. While primarily a terrestrial quadruped, it is equally at home in bodies of water. Notably, Drednaw is capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, transforming into a bipedal titan whose massive shell covers its body like a fortress, and gaining access to the unique G-Max Move, **G-Max Stonesurge**, which scatters sharp rocks across the battlefield.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 115, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 48, Sp. Def 68, Speed 74.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Weather Sweeper. Its high physical Attack and solid Defense make it a threatening presence, especially when supported by specific environmental conditions.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Ground, and Electric**, with a catastrophic **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass**. It **resists Normal, Flying, Poison, and Ice**, and is exceptionally resistant to **Fire** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive physical power and ability-synergy, key moves include **Liquidation** for heavy Water-type STAB, **Stone Edge** for high-crit Rock-type damage, **Crunch** to take advantage of its biting prowess, and **Swords Dance** to boost its Attack to sweeping levels.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Strong Jaw:** Increases the power of all biting moves (like Crunch, Ice Fang, and Jaw Lock) by 50%.
    * **Shell Armor:** Protects the Pokémon from critical hits, ensuring consistent defensive calculations.
    * **Swift Swim (Hidden):** Doubling its Speed stat during rain, this ability transforms Drednaw into a terrifying late-game sweeper on Rain-based competitive teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Drednaw is the final form of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Chewtle** once it reaches **Level 22**, at which point its jaw strength increases exponentially and it develops its signature rocky carapace. Biologically, it is a hardy creature belonging to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20. Its physiology is built for both endurance and explosive force, allowing it to extend its neck rapidly to snatch prey or strike opponents with its horn.
