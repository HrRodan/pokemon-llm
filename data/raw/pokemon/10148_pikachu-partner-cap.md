## Identity & Lore
Partner Cap Pikachu (Pokedex #10148) is a specialized Mouse Pokémon wearing the iconic hat seen on its trainer during their initial journey in the Kanto region, specifically commemorating the 20th-anniversary film *I Choose You!*. This yellow, quadrupedal Electric-type is famously found in forest habitats, where it stores electricity in its cheek sacs. While this specific variant is tied to Generation I (Kanto) nostalgia, the species has expanded significantly across the Pokémon world, with its evolutionary line gaining a Gigantamax form in the Galar region and Alolan variants for its evolved state, Raichu. Lore suggests that when several Pikachu gather, their collective electrical discharge can generate massive lightning storms. This "Partner Cap" version represents a deep bond with a trainer, often possessing unique event-exclusive moves or Z-Move compatibility (like the *10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt*) that standard Pikachu cannot access.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 55, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Fast Glass Cannon / Mixed Attacker. While its base stats are modest, this Pokémon is designed to be used with its signature held item, the **Light Ball**, which doubles its Attack and Special Attack stats, making it a surprisingly potent offensive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground** and **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**. It has no double weaknesses, but its extremely low defensive stats mean it cannot survive most neutral hits.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging the power of the Light Ball and its high Speed, key moves include **Volt Tackle** (for massive physical damage), **Thunderbolt** (for reliable special STAB), **Iron Tail** (to cover Rock and Ice-type weaknesses), and **Volt Switch** (to maintain momentum and pivot out of danger).
* **Abilities:** **Static** (Provides a 30% chance to paralyze any opponent that hits it with a contact move); **Lightning Rod** (Grants immunity to Electric moves and boosts Special Attack when hit by one, providing excellent utility in doubles).

## Evolution & Biology
Pikachu-Partner-Cap is the middle stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pichu** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (minimum 220). While standard Pikachu evolve into Raichu when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**, special event variants like the Partner Cap form are typically unable to evolve, remaining in their iconic state to maintain their unique appearance. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. Biologically, it is known for its "Play Rough" nature and its ability to channel electricity through its tail, which it often uses as a lightning rod to safely discharge excess energy.
