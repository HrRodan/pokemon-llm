## Identity & Lore
Togekiss (Pokedex #468) is the Jubilee Pokémon, a dual-type Fairy/Flying creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its peaceful disposition, this avian Pokémon possesses pure white plumage and a distinct triangular shape. According to Sinnoh myths and biology, Togekiss detests conflict and will actively avoid regions plagued by strife or turmoil, making sightings of it exceptionally rare in modern times. It is said to share blessings and good luck only with those who respect one another and maintain a harmonious heart. While it has no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a highly influential Pokémon in competitive history due to its unique biological capabilities.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 50, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 120, Sp. Def 115, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Disruption Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** Togekiss is **weak to Poison, Steel, Rock, Electric, and Ice**. However, it boasts significant defensive utility with **immunities to Dragon and Ground**, and resistances to Grass and Dark, along with a **double resistance (0.25x) to Fighting and Bug**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack (120) and natural bulk, key moves include **Air Slash** (essential for flinching strategies), **Moonblast** (powerful STAB), **Aura Sphere** (coverage against Steel and Rock types), and **Nasty Plot** (to sharply raise Special Attack). **Roost** and **Thunder Wave** are also notable utility options found in its move pool.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Hustle:** Boosts physical Attack by 50% but lowers accuracy (generally suboptimal for Togekiss due to low Attack).
    *   **Serene Grace:** Doubles the chance of a move's secondary effect occurring. This makes moves like Air Slash (60% flinch chance) heavily favored in competitive play.
    *   **Super Luck (Hidden):** Increases the critical-hit ratio of moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Togekiss is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins as Togepi, which evolves into Togetic when leveled up with **High Friendship** (Happiness value of 220+). Togetic then evolves into Togekiss solely when exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. It belongs to the **Flying** and **Fairy** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 10 cycles.
