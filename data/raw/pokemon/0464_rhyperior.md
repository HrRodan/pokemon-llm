## Identity & Lore
Rhyperior (Pokédex #464) is the formidable Drill Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Standing as a massive bipedal creature covered in gray, rock-hard armor plates, Rhyperior is celebrated for its immense physical strength and durability. Uniquely, it possesses hollows in its palms into which it inserts rocks to fire as projectiles using muscular contraction; in the wild, it is known to accidentally load and fire Geodude as ammunition. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the final evolution of the original Kanto heavyweight, Rhydon.
