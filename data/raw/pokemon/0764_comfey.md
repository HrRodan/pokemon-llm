## Identity & Lore
Comfey (Pokedex #764) is the Posy Picker Pokémon, a distinctive Fairy-type species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This small, green, ring-shaped creature is defined by its symbiotic relationship with flora; it meticulously picks flowers to decorate its highly nutritious vine. This vine does more than just hold the flowers—it revitalizes them, causing them to emit a soothing, aromatic scent that possesses healing properties for both humans and Pokémon. Because of this, Comfey are frequently found assisting medical professionals in Alolan hospitals and Pokémon Centers. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its unique biological niche as a "living lei" makes it an iconic representation of Alolan culture and a staple in supportive combat roles.

    * **Triage:** Its most competitive ability, which gives the highest priority to healing moves, allowing Comfey to move before almost anyone else when using recovery or draining attacks.
    * **Flower Veil:** Prevents the lowering of stats and status conditions for ally Grass-type Pokémon, making it a niche but effective partner for Grass-heavy teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Comfey is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is a member of the **Plant** Egg Group, reflecting its deep biological connection to botanical life despite its pure Fairy typing. It has a hatch counter of 20, and in the wild, it is often found holding a **Misty Seed**, which boosts Special Defense on Misty Terrain. Its fast growth rate allows it to reach its full combat potential quickly, making it a reliable choice for trainers looking for immediate utility. Its behavior is generally peaceful, as it uses its flowers to distract or calm potential threats rather than engaging in direct physical confrontation.
