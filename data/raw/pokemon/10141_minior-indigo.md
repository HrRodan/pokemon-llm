## Identity & Lore
Indigo Minior (Pokedex #10141) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique Rock/Flying-type organism that originated in the Alola region (Generation VII). Though typically appearing as a rocky, brown meteor, this specific indigo variant represents the vibrant core hidden beneath its stony exterior. Minior spend their lives in the ozone layer, consuming dust and metallic particles; the specific chemical composition of the debris they ingest determines the color of their core. When their outer shell becomes too heavy from accumulated material, they plummet toward the earth. While they do not possess Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, Minior is defined by its dramatic physical transformation during combat, shifting between a defensive "Meteor Form" and this fragile, high-velocity "Core Form."

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Electric, Steel, Ice, and Rock**. It **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its balanced offensive stats and incredible Speed in Core Form, its most effective moves include **Shell Smash** (to double its offensive pressure), **Acrobatics** (which pairs perfectly with a consumed White Herb), **Earthquake** (for vital coverage against Steel and Rock types), and **Power Gem** or **Stone Edge** for reliable STAB damage.
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon stays in its defensive Meteor Form while above 50% HP, granting it high defenses and immunity to status conditions. Once HP drops below half, the shell breaks, revealing the Core Form and drastically increasing its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed while lowering its defenses).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it exists in a state of constant biological flux due to its habitat in the stratosphere. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and is genderless, requiring a Ditto for breeding purposes. The Indigo Core variant is one of seven possible colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet). In the wild, they are difficult to capture because they frequently use moves like **Self-Destruct** or **Explosion** when threatened, shattering their own cores rather than being caught. If their shell is broken and they remain on the ground for too long, their core will eventually vanish as they are unable to survive the atmospheric pressure of the planet's surface for extended periods.
