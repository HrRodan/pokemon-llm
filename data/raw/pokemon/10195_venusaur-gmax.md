## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Venusaur (Pokedex #10195) is the massive, empowered form of the Seed Pokémon, representing the pinnacle of the Kanto region's Grass-type starter evolution line. Originally discovered in Generation I, this specific Gigantamax manifestation occurred within the Galar region, where Power Spot energy causes its flower to bloom to such an extent that it covers its entire body like a massive, petal-fringed canopy. The plant blooms most vibrantly when absorbing solar energy, and its thick, powerful vines are capable of toppling buildings. While this form is a temporary transformation, Venusaur is also capable of **Mega Evolution**, further cementing its status as one of the most versatile and enduring Grass/Poison types in the Pokémon world. It primarily inhabits lush grasslands, though its Gigantamax form is exclusively sighted in Power Spot locations like Pokémon Stadiuums.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 82, Defense 83, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 100, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Sun Sweeper / Special Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ice, Flying, and Psychic**. It possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Grass** and further resists **Water, Electric, Fighting, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack stat and Gigantamax potential, its optimal moveset includes **Solar Beam** (for high damage in sunlight), **Sludge Bomb** (for a reliable Poison-type STAB and poison chance), **Earth Power** (for critical coverage against Fire and Steel types), and **Giga Drain** (to maintain longevity through healing). While Gigantamaxed, its Grass-type attacks transform into **G-Max Vine Lash**, which deals continuous damage to non-Grass-type opponents for four turns.
* **Abilities:** **Overgrow** (Powers up Grass-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third) and **Chlorophyll** (A powerful Hidden Ability that doubles its Speed stat under harsh sunlight, making it a premier threat in Sun-based competitive teams).

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Venusaur is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line originating in Kanto. It begins as **Bulbasaur**, which evolves into **Ivysaur** starting at Level 16. The transition to its final form, **Venusaur**, occurs at Level 32. To achieve the Gigantamax form provided in this data, a Venusaur must possess the Gigantamax Factor, often acquired by consuming Max Soup in the Galar region. Biologically, it belongs to both the **Monster** and **Plant** Egg Groups, and researchers note a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its status as a starter Pokémon requiring significant care. Its growth rate is medium-slow, typical of powerful Pokémon that require dedicated training to reach their full potential.
