## Identity & Lore
Mega Ampharos (Pokedex #10045) is the Light Pokémon, a majestic and powerful transformation of the standard Ampharos. Originally discovered in the Johto region (Generation II), this Mega Evolved form manifests when Ampharos reacts to an Ampharosite. Upon Mega Evolving, it regains the thick, woolly coat it lost during its earlier evolutionary stages, now appearing as a flowing, white mane and tail studded with glowing red orbs. These orbs emit a light so intense it can be seen from space, traditionally serving as a beacon for lost travelers and sailors. While the base form is a pure Electric-type, the awakening of its dormant genes during Mega Evolution grants it the secondary Dragon-typing, reflecting its refined and draconic lineage.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 95, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 165, Sp. Def 110, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker. Mega Ampharos sacrifices its already low Speed for massive increases in defensive bulk and a monumental Special Attack stat.
* **Type Matchups:** As an Electric/Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ground, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It possesses significant **resistances to Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, and Flying**, and it features a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Electric**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its staggering 165 Special Attack, Mega Ampharos excels with high-power elemental strikes and tactical pivoting. Key moves include **Thunderbolt** (reliable STAB), **Dragon Pulse** (consistent secondary STAB), **Volt Switch** (to maintain momentum while dealing heavy damage), and **Focus Blast** (to hammer Steel and Rock types that might attempt to wall its primary attacks).
* **Abilities:** Mold Breaker (This ability allows Mega Ampharos to ignore the defensive abilities of its targets. It can strike through Sturdy, hit Pokémon that have Levitate with Ground-type moves if available, and bypass Volt Absorb or Lightning Rod, ensuring its powerful discharges always find their mark).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Ampharos is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, augmented by Mega Evolution. The cycle begins with **Mareep**, which evolves into **Flaaffy** starting at Level 15. Flaaffy then matures into **Ampharos** at Level 30. Unlike standard evolutions, the transformation into Mega Ampharos is temporary and occurs only in battle when holding its specific Mega Stone. Biologically, it is highly social and often found in grasslands. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Ground** Egg Groups, and while it is a powerful combatant, it retains a gentle temperament. It has a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant training to reach its full potential, and its signature glowing tail remains its most defining biological feature throughout its life cycle.
