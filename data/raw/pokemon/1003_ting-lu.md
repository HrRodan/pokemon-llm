## Identity & Lore
Ting-Lu (Pokedex #1003) is the Ruinous Pokémon, a legendary Dark and Ground-type entity that first appeared in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is one of the four "Treasures of Ruin," ancient artifacts brought to Paldea from a distant land and transformed into Pokémon by the concentrated negative emotions of humanity. Specifically, Ting-Lu is the manifestation of fear poured into an ancient ritual vessel, which has clad itself in rocks, soil, and debris to form a massive, moose-like body. Its most striking feature is the enormous, cracked metal bowl that rests upon its head, serving as both a ceremonial crown and a source of devastating power. According to Paldean legend, Ting-Lu was sealed away behind the Grasswither Shrine in the Socarrat Trail to prevent its overwhelming power from sinking the land into ruin. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Paradox-adjacent legendary makes it one of the most imposing forces in the Paldean wilderness.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 155, Attack 110, Defense 125, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 80, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Behemoth Physical Tank / Entry Hazard Lead.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Bug, Fairy, Water, Grass, and Ice**. It **resists Poison, Rock, Ghost, and Dark**, and possesses complete **immunity to Psychic and Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Ting-Lu excels at controlling the battlefield and wearing down opponents with high-impact physical and utility moves. Key selections include **Earthquake** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Ruination** to instantly halve the opponent's remaining HP, **Stealth Rock** or **Spikes** for entry hazard pressure, and **Whirlwind** to phaze out boosted threats. Its massive weight also makes **Heavy Slam** a devastating option against lighter targets.
* **Abilities:** Vessel of Ruin (The power of the Pokémon's ruinous vessel lowers the Special Attack stat of all Pokémon on the field except itself). This ability effectively bolsters Ting-Lu's Special Defense, making it deceptively difficult to take down even with super-effective special moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Ting-Lu is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. As a member of the "Undiscovered" Egg Group (No Eggs), it cannot be bred. Its biology is less organic and more elemental; it is a spiritual entity inhabiting a 699.7kg mass of earth and metal. Standing at 2.7 meters tall, its presence is enough to create deep fissures in the earth with a single step. In competitive environments, it is favored for its "Slow" growth rate and its ability to survive nearly any single unboosted physical hit due to its massive 155 Base HP and 125 Defense. It is often found in the company of the other Ruinous treasures—Chien-Pao, Wo-Chien, and Chi-Yu—representing the catastrophic consequences of human emotion.
