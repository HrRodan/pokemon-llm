## Identity & Lore
Paldean Wooper (Pokedex #10253) is the Poison/Ground-type Paldean Form of the Water Fish Pokémon, originally discovered in the Johto region but adapted to the Paldea region in Generation IX. Unlike its Johto counterpart, Paldean Wooper migrated to land after losing territory battles underwater. To survive on land, it developed a poisonous film to protect its body, giving it a duller brown color compared to the classic blue variant. Its gills have hardened into thick, bone-like structures. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Clodsire, is a prominent defensive staple in the Paldean ecosystem. It thrives in muddy wetlands and "waters-edge" habitats where it searches for food in cold weather.

## Evolution & Biology
Paldean Wooper is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Clodsire** starting at **Level 20**. This is a distinct evolutionary branch compared to the Johto variant, which evolves into Quagsire at the same level. Biologically, Paldean Wooper is highly resilient, belonging to the **Water 1 and Ground** Egg Groups. With a hatch counter of 20, it is a common sight for breeders looking to produce defensive walls. Its slow speed is compensated by its ability to stall opponents using its toxic skin and durable earthen biology.
