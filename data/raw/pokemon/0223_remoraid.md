## Identity & Lore
Remoraid (Pokedex #223) is the Jet Pokémon, a distinct Water-type entity introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. While it appears to be a small, gray fish inhabiting the sea, its biological structure functions similarly to a firearm. Remoraid is renowned for its incredible marksmanship; it can forcibly expel water to strike moving prey with absolute precision from distances exceeding 300 feet. In the wild, it often exhibits commensal behavior, attaching itself to the underbelly of **Mantine** using its dorsal fin to scavenge for food and gain protection. Despite its small stature, it possesses a surprisingly diverse movepool, reflecting its design inspiration as a living weapon.

## Evolution & Biology
Remoraid is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Octillery** starting at **Level 25**. This transformation is notable for the drastic shift in morphology, moving from a fish-like "handgun" design to an octopus-like "tank" or "cannon" design. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 2** Egg Groups.
