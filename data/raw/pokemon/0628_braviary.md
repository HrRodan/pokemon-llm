## Identity & Lore
Braviary (Pokedex #628) is the Valiant Pokémon, a powerful avian species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its immense physical strength and unwavering bravery, it is said that a single Braviary possesses the power to lift and carry a car while in flight. Its red, white, and blue plumage reflects its fierce spirit; these Pokémon are famously loyal, often continuing to fight for their comrades regardless of the injuries they sustain. In the wild, they are known to be aggressive but deeply honorable. While this Unovan form is a Normal/Flying type, a notable regional variant exists in the ancient past: **Hisuian Braviary**, which adopts a Psychic/Flying typing and a more stoic temperament.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 123, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 57, Sp. Def 75, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Bulky Attacker. With a high Attack stat and solid HP, it excels at trading hits and breaking through defensive cores.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It **resists Bug and Grass**, and possesses two key **immunities to Ghost and Ground** moves. Notably, its Flying typing neutralizes its potential Fighting weakness.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite physical prowess and high-impact movepool, key moves include **Brave Bird** (high-power STAB), **Close Combat** (essential coverage against Rock and Steel types), **U-turn** (for maintaining momentum), and **Roost** (to mitigate recoil and provide longevity).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Keen Eye:** Prevents accuracy loss and ignores the opponent's evasion boosts.
    * **Sheer Force:** Increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, but removes those effects (highly effective with moves like Rock Slide or Iron Head).
    * **Defiant (Hidden Ability):** Sharply raises Attack when any of its stats are lowered by an opponent, making it an excellent counter to "Intimidate" users.

## Evolution & Biology
Braviary is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rufflet** once it reaches the significantly high threshold of **Level 54**. This late evolution is characteristic of many Pokémon native to the Unova region. Interestingly, the species is entirely male, requiring a Ditto for breeding purposes. It belongs to the **Flying** egg group and has a slow growth rate, reflecting the intensive training required to master its massive wingspan and combat skills. Its biology is optimized for aerial dominance, utilizing sharp talons and a powerful beak to overwhelm predators and protect its territory.
