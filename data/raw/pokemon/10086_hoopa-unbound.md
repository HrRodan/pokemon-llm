## Identity & Lore
Hoopa-Unbound (Pokedex #10086) is the Unbound Form of the Mythical Mischief Pokémon, a colossal entity that regained its true power after being sealed away for centuries. First discovered in Generation VI (Kalos), this Psychic/Dark-type powerhouse is characterized by its six massive, disjointed arms and its ability to utilize golden rings to warp space, allowing it to transport entire islands or summon other Legendary Pokémon from across dimensions. Unlike its smaller "Hoopa Confined" state, the Unbound form is a manifestation of raw, chaotic energy. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its transformation is triggered by the **Prison Bottle** artifact, which restores its strength for three days. Its purple, djinn-like appearance and massive 6.5-meter height reflect its lore as a "troublemaker" capable of bending reality to its whim.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 160, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 170, Sp. Def 130, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker. With astronomical offensive stats on both sides, Hoopa-Unbound can dismantle defensive cores that rely on either Physical or Special bulk.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug-type attacks** and is weak to **Fairy-type moves**. It is **immune to Psychic-type moves** due to its Dark typing, but notably lacks any resistances to other types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite offensive stats, its most effective tools include its signature physical move **Hyperspace Fury** (which bypasses Protect), the high-power special move **Psychic**, the flinching-capable **Dark Pulse**, and **Nasty Plot** to further boost its Special Attack to world-ending levels. For coverage, it often utilizes **Focus Blast** to hit opposing Dark and Steel types.
* **Abilities:** Magician (Steals the held item of a target hit by one of Hoopa's moves, provided Hoopa is not already holding an item). This ability rewards tactical item management and can disrupt opponents relying on Choice items or Leftovers.

## Evolution & Biology
Hoopa-Unbound is a unique form of the Mythical Pokémon Hoopa. It does not evolve through traditional leveling; instead, it undergoes a **Form Change** when the Prison Bottle is used on Hoopa Confined. This state is temporary in most games, reverting to Confined form after three days pass or if it is deposited into a PC/storage system. As a Mythical Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group and cannot be bred. Its biology is centered around its six floating arms and the rings it carries, which serve as portals to distant locations. Despite its slow growth rate, its base experience yield is exceptionally high, reflecting its status as a pinnacle of Pokémon power.
