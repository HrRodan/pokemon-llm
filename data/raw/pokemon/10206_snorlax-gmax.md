## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Snorlax (Pokedex #10206) is the colossal Gigantamax form of the Sleeping Pokémon, a transformation first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. While the base species originated in the mountains of Kanto (Generation I), this specific form occurs when a Snorlax with the Gigantamax Factor undergoes Dynamaxing. Its appearance is legendary: the seeds and small pebbles that were once caught in its belly fur have sprouted into a lush, miniature ecosystem. A massive tree now grows atop its stomach, surrounded by grass and red flowers, making the Pokémon resemble a small mountain or a forest clearing. Despite this massive growth, it remains incredibly lazy; it is said that this Pokémon doesn't even move to attack, instead merely rolling over or flailing its limbs, causing tremors that can level mountains.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 160, Attack 110, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 110, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Tank. Its massive HP pool combined with high Special Defense makes it an incredible sponge for special attacks.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost** types. It has no natural resistances, though its abilities can modify this.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Attack stat and G-Max potential, its optimal moveset includes **Body Slam** (for STAB and paralysis chance), **High Horsepower** (for ground-type coverage), **Crunch** (to hit Ghost-types it is immune to), and **Heavy Slam** (leveraging its 1000kg weight). In its Gigantamax form, its Normal-type moves transform into **G-Max Replenish**, which deals massive damage and has a 50% chance to restore consumed Berries.
* **Abilities:** **Immunity** (prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by the Poison status); **Thick Fat** (provides vital resistances by halving damage from incoming Fire and Ice-type moves); **Gluttony** (Hidden Ability; causes the Pokémon to consume its held Berry at 50% HP rather than 25%, providing earlier sustainability).

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Snorlax represents the peak of the Snorlax evolutionary line, though Gigantamaxing is a temporary transformation rather than a permanent evolution. The line begins with **Munchlax**, a frantic eater that evolves into **Snorlax** when leveled up with **High Friendship (min_happiness: 160)**. While standard Snorlax are found in mountain habitats and are known for their "slow" growth rate, only those possessing the rare Gigantamax Factor can achieve this forest-bearing form. It belongs to the **Monster** egg group and requires a significant amount of energy to hatch, evidenced by its 40-cycle hatch counter. Its biology is centered entirely around calorie preservation; it can eat moldy or even poisonous food without ill effect, and its stomach acids are strong enough to dissolve any kind of toxin.
