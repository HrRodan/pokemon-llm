## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Copperajah (Pokedex #10224) is the colossal Gigantamax form of the Copperderm Pokémon, first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. Standing at a staggering 23 meters tall, this massive Steel-type Pokémon resembles a grand, sentient monolith or a fortress built in the image of an elephant. Its distinctive green coloration is the result of copper oxidation over many years, a biological trait that grants it high resistance to water. Lore suggests that Copperajah were not originally native to Galar but were brought from another region long ago to assist humans with heavy labor and construction due to their immense physical strength and docile yet hardworking nature. In its Gigantamax state, Copperajah stands on its hind legs, and its trunk becomes a devastating weapon capable of leveling mountains. While it does not have a Mega Evolution, this Gigantamax form grants it access to the unique move **G-Max Steelsurge**, which scatters sharp spikes across the battlefield to damage opponents as they switch in.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 122, Attack 130, Defense 69, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 69, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Trick Room Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Steel-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, and Fire**. It possesses a massive list of resistances, including **Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy**, and it is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 130 Attack, Copperajah excels with high-impact physical strikes. Optimal moves include **Heavy Slam** (which scales with its massive weight), **Iron Head** (to trigger Sheer Force boosts), **Play Rough** (for coverage against Fighting-types), and **Earthquake** or **High Horsepower** to deal with opposing Fire and Electric types.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sheer Force:** Increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, but ignores those effects. This makes moves like Iron Head and Play Rough exceptionally powerful.
    * **Heavy Metal (Hidden Ability):** Doubles the Pokémon's weight. This is tactically vital for maximizing the damage of Heavy Slam, especially since Copperajah-Gmax already weighs 1,000 kg.

## Evolution & Biology
Copperajah-Gmax is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cufant** starting at **Level 34**. While any Copperajah can potentially be a powerhouse, only specific individuals possessing the Gigantamax Factor—often obtained through Max Soup or special Max Raid Dens in the Galar region—can transform into this towering Gigantamax form during battle. Biologically, Copperajah are exceptionally heavy and sturdy, belonging to the **Ground** and **Mineral** Egg Groups. They have a Hatch Counter of 25, indicating a moderate breeding cycle. Their skin is thick and metallic, providing natural armor that reflects their role as the premier heavy-lifters of the Pokémon world.
