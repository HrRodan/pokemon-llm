## Identity & Lore
Zangoose (Pokedex #335) is the Cat Ferret Pokémon, a bipedal Normal-type creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Recognized by its white fur and red scar-like markings, Zangoose is renowned for its bitter, instinctive rivalry with the Pokémon **Seviper**. Memories of battling Seviper are etched into every cell of its body, driving it to fight with incredible agility and sharp claws. This Pokémon inhabits grasslands where it can utilize its speed to dodge attacks adroitly. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its lore is defined by its eternal feud with its poison-type nemesis.
