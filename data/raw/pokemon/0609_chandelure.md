## Identity & Lore
Chandelure (Pokedex #609) is the Luring Pokémon, a sinister and elegant entity originally discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Resembling a sentient chandelier, it possesses a black, metal-like frame and five flickering purple flames that are fueled not by oxygen, but by the spirits it consumes. This Ghost/Fire-type is notorious for its macabre behavior; it waves its flickering flames to put its prey into a hypnotic trance, then proceeds to absorb their life force. The spirits consumed by Chandelure are said to be destined to wander the world forever, lost and burning. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique aesthetic and overwhelming power have made it a staple in competitive play and a frequent candidate for hypothetical Paradox forms. It is often found in urban environments, specifically within abandoned mansions or dark buildings where it can lie in wait for unsuspecting travelers.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 55, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 145, Sp. Def 90, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker / Special Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost, Dark, Ground, Rock, and Water**. Conversely, it is highly resilient, **resisting Fire, Grass, Ice, Poison, Steel, and Fairy**, while possessing a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**. Due to its Ghost typing, it is **immune to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** With one of the highest non-legendary Special Attack stats in the game, Chandelure is a terrifying offensive threat. It utilizes **Shadow Ball** for consistent Ghost-type STAB, **Fire Blast** or **Overheat** for devastating Fire-type damage, and **Energy Ball** to provide crucial coverage against its Water, Ground, and Rock-type weaknesses. It also benefits from **Trick**, which can be used to swap a Choice Scarf or Specs onto a defensive opponent to cripple them.
* **Abilities:** **Flash Fire** (Grants immunity to Fire moves and boosts its own Fire-type damage when hit by one), **Flame Body** (Has a 30% chance to burn attackers who make contact), and its Hidden Ability **Infiltrator** (Allows its attacks to bypass the effects of Substitute, Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil).

## Evolution & Biology
Chandelure is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Litwick**, a small candle-like Pokémon. Upon reaching **Level 41**, it evolves into the lamp-like **Lampent**. To achieve its final form as **Chandelure**, it must be **exposed to a Dusk Stone**. Biologically, Chandelure is a spirit-dependent organism that belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group. Trainers seeking to breed this Pokémon should note its hatch counter of 20, which is relatively standard for its power level. Despite its refined, ornamental appearance, its biology is inherently predatory, as it utilizes its "arms" to manipulate the spectral flames it generates to trap and consume spiritual energy.
