## Identity & Lore
Slugma (Pokedex #218) is the amorphous Lava Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Composed entirely of molten magma, this entity inhabits volcanic mountain regions where extreme heat is prevalent. Its biology dictates a ceaseless existence; Slugma must constantly move to generate internal heat. If it stops, its red, gelatinous body cools and brittlely hardens into rock, rendering it immobile. Lacking a skeletal structure, it bunches its body to congregate heat. While originally discovered in Johto, it is also heavily populated in the Hoenn region's Fiery Path.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 40, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 40, Speed 20.

* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fire-type, it is **weak to Water, Ground, and Rock**. It **resists Fire, Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel, and Fairy**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its respectable Special Attack and access to reliable recovery, key moves include **Flamethrower** (STAB), **Earth Power** (coverage against Rock and Fire types), **Ancient Power**, and **Recover** to sustain its presence on the field.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Magma Armor:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming frozen.
    *   **Flame Body:** Contact with this Pokémon has a 30% chance of burning the attacker. Outside of battle, this ability halves the steps required to hatch eggs.
    *   **Weak Armor (Hidden):** When hit by a physical move, Defense is lowered by one stage, but Speed is sharply raised.

## Evolution & Biology
Slugma is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Magcargo** when leveled up to **Level 38**. Upon evolution, its skin hardens into a shell, gaining the Rock typing. It belongs to the Indeterminate (Amorphous) Egg Group. Due to its purely elemental composition, it requires hot environments to thrive before it develops the protective shell seen in its evolved form.
