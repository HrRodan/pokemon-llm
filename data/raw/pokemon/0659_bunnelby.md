## Identity & Lore
Bunnelby (Pokedex #659) is the Digging Pokémon, first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. This small, brown leporid is characterized by its oversized, shovel-like ears which possess enough physical strength to sever thick tree roots and move heavy earth. It is a nocturnal laborer, frequently known to spend the entire night digging burrows in the soil. While Bunnelby itself does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its evolved state, Diggersby, is a notable powerhouse in competitive history due to its unique typing and ability combinations. Its presence in the wild is often a sign of complex underground tunnel networks.

## Evolution & Biology
Bunnelby is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the Normal/Ground-type **Diggersby** upon reaching **Level 20**. Biologically, Bunnelby are highly industrious and utilize their ears as primary appendages for both environmental manipulation and defense. They belong to the **Ground** Egg Group, and with a relatively fast hatch counter of 15, they are easily bred by trainers. Their brown fur provides excellent camouflage in the dirt and mountain habitats they frequent, while their "upright" shape allows them to remain alert for predators while working.
