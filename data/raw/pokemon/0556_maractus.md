## Identity & Lore
Maractus (Pokedex #556) is the Cactus Pokémon, first discovered in the arid regions of Generation V (Unova). This green, bipedal flora is characterized by its vibrant yellow flowers and rabbit-ear-like appendages. Maractus is well-known for its rhythmic behavior; it moves its body with an up-tempo song and dance, creating a sound reminiscent of maracas. This rhythmic rattling is not merely aesthetic but a survival mechanism used to drive away avian Pokémon that attempt to prey on its nutrient-rich flower seeds. While it currently lacks a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its unique biology allows it to thrive in harsh desert climates where other plant life would wither. It is often found carrying a **Miracle Seed** to boost its botanical powers.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 86, Defense 67, Sp. Atk 106, Sp. Def 67, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker / Sun Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Maractus relies heavily on its superior Special Attack and its ability to manipulate the weather. Key moves include **Leaf Storm** for massive immediate damage, **Giga Drain** for combined damage and sustain, **Energy Ball** for reliable consistency, and **Weather Ball**, which becomes a devastating coverage tool (turning into a 100-power Fire move) when paired with sunlight.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Water Absorb:** Grants immunity to Water-type moves and restores HP when hit by them, making it an excellent switch-in against bulky waters.
    * **Chlorophyll:** Doubles its Speed stat in harsh sunlight, compensating for its low base Speed and turning it into a dangerous sweeper.
    * **Storm Drain (Hidden):** Draws in all Water-type moves in double battles to increase its Special Attack stat, while granting total immunity to Water damage.

## Evolution & Biology
Maractus is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is a standalone biological marvel of the desert, possessing a high capture rate (255), suggesting it is relatively easy to befriend if found. Biologically, it belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group, and breeders can expect a moderate hatching cycle (20 hatch counters). Despite its prickly exterior, it has a base happiness of 70, reflecting its cheerful, dancing nature. Its movepool is surprisingly diverse for a Grass-type, featuring utility and disruptive options like **Spikes**, **Spiky Shield**, and **Sucker Punch**, allowing it to punish physical attackers who underestimate its defensive utility.
