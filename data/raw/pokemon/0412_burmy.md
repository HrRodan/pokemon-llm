## Identity & Lore
Burmy (Pokédex #412) is the Bagworm Pokémon, an insectoid creature introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. This small, green Pokémon is famous for its unique biology, where it constructs a protective cloak to shelter its sensitive skin from cold, wintry winds. Burmy possesses a unique form-changing mechanic based on the environment of its last battle, resulting in three distinct variations: **Plant Cloak** (crafted from twigs and leaves in grassy areas), **Sandy Cloak** (made of sand and rocks in caves or deserts), and **Trash Cloak** (composed of insulation and refuse in urban buildings). While it does not possess Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its form at the moment of evolution is critical for female specimens.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 29, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 29, Sp. Def 45, Speed 36.
*   **Archetype:** Early-Game Defensive Support / Little Cup Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Bug-type**, Burmy is **weak to Fire, Flying, and Rock**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, and Grass** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its low offensive presence, Burmy relies on utility and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). Its optimal moveset from the available pool includes **Bug Bite** for physical damage and berry consumption, **Electroweb** for speed control and coverage against Flying-types, **Struggle Bug** to lower the opponent's Special Attack, and **Protect** to stall for turns.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Shed Skin:** Gives the Pokémon a 33% chance to heal its own status conditions at the end of each turn.
    *   **Overcoat (Hidden Ability):** Protects the Pokémon from weather damage (like Sandstorm or Hail) and powder-based moves, fitting for a Pokémon wrapped in protective layers.

## Evolution & Biology
Burmy acts as the base for a divergent, **2-stage evolutionary line** that is dependent on gender. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and takes approximately 15 cycles to hatch.
*   **Female Burmy** evolve into **Wormadam** starting at **Level 20**. Uniquely, the cloak Burmy is wearing at the moment of evolution (Plant, Sandy, or Trash) becomes permanent, determining Wormadam's secondary typing.
*   **Male Burmy** evolve into **Mothim** starting at **Level 20**, discarding their cloak entirely to gain the Flying type.
