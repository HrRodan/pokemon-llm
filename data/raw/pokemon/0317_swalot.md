## Identity & Lore
Swalot (Pokedex #317) is the Poison Bag Pokémon, a large, purple, amorphous creature first introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Residing primarily in **grasslands**, this pure Poison-type is defined by its cavernous mouth and incredibly potent stomach acids capable of dissolving almost anything. When hunting, Swalot spurts a hideously toxic fluid from its pores to weaken prey before gulping it down whole. Despite its blobbish appearance, it is a dangerous predator that relies on chemical warfare and durability. Swalot does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants.
