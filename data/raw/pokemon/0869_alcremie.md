## Identity & Lore
Alcremie (Pokedex #869) is the Cream Pokémon, a delightful Fairy-type creature first discovered in Generation VIII (Galar). This diminutive Pokémon is composed entirely of cream, which it produces in abundance; when it trusts a Trainer, it will treat them to berries it has decorated with this sweet, whipped cream. Alcremie is famous for its extreme phenotypic diversity, boasting 63 different visual combinations based on the "Sweet" item it held and the direction, duration, and time of day its trainer spun while it was a Milcery. Beyond its standard forms, Alcremie is capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, transforming into a massive, multi-tiered cake. In its Gigantamax form, it can use the signature move **G-Max Finale**, which heals its allies while dealing massive damage.

## Evolution & Biology
Alcremie is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Milcery** through a unique mechanical process: it must be **leveled up while the player performs a "Spin"** (rotating the joystick rapidly) while Milcery is holding one of several "Sweet" items (such as a Strawberry Sweet, Love Sweet, or Star Sweet). The specific flavor and color of the Alcremie (e.g., Ruby Cream, Matcha Cream, Rainbow Swirl) are determined by the length of the spin and the time of day. Biologically, it belongs to the **Fairy and Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Groups. With a hatch counter of 20, it requires a moderate amount of effort to breed, though its various forms make it a prize for dedicated collectors.
