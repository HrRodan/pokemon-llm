## Identity & Lore
Dratini (Pokedex #147) is the Dragon Pokémon, a rare and elusive serpentine creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its long, blue, cylindrical body and white underbelly, Dratini was once considered a mythical entity due to its extreme rarity, until a colony was discovered living underwater. It constantly grows, shedding its skin regularly to accommodate the massive amounts of life energy building up within its body; it often hides behind waterfalls during this vulnerable molting process. While Dratini itself does not possess alternate forms, it is the base form of a pseudo-legendary line that eventually evolves into the powerful Dragonite.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 41, Attack 64, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper (Little Cup).
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy** moves. It naturally **resists Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its higher Attack stat and access to setup moves, key techniques include **Dragon Dance** (to boost speed and power), **Outrage** (high-power STAB), **Extreme Speed** (priority engagement), and **Aqua Tail** (for coverage against Ground or Rock types).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Shed Skin:** Has a 30% chance to cure its own status conditions at the end of each turn, fitting its lore of constant molting.
    *   **Marvel Scale (Hidden Ability):** Increases Defense by 50% if the Pokémon is suffering from a non-volatile status condition (burn, paralysis, sleep, poison, or freeze).

## Evolution & Biology
Dratini is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dragonair** starting at **Level 30**, which subsequently evolves into **Dragonite** starting at **Level 55**. Unusually for a dragon, it belongs to both the **Water 1** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, reflecting its aquatic habitat. In the wild, it may occasionally carry a **Dragon Scale**.
