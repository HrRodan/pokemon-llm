## Identity & Lore
Budew (Pokédex #406) is the Bud Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Poison creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). This small, green, humanoid Pokémon is defined by the tightly closed bud atop its head. Biologically sensitive to seasonal changes, Budew enters a dormant state during winter, closing its bud to endure the harsh cold. When spring arrives, the bud opens to release pollen, causing allergic reactions in some humans. As a "Baby" Pokémon, it is generally docile and inhabits areas near clean water, indicating a healthy ecosystem. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the initial stage of the powerful Roserade line.

## Evolution & Biology
Budew is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Roselia** when leveled up with **High Friendship during the daytime**. Subsequently, Roselia evolves into **Roserade** when exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. Although Budew falls into the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group due to its status as a baby Pokémon, it can be obtained by breeding a Roselia or Roserade holding a **Rose Incense**; otherwise, the egg will hatch directly into Roselia.
