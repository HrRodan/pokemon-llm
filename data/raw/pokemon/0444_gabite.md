## Identity & Lore
Gabite (Pokedex #444) is the Cave Pokémon, a dual-type Dragon/Ground creature first discovered in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Residing primarily in dark, labyrinthine caverns, this blue, bipedal dragon is famous for its obsession with shiny objects; it aggressively excavates and hoards gems in its nest, often expanding its territory to accommodate its growing treasure collection. Folklore surrounding Gabite claims that medicine brewed from its scales possesses the ability to heal even incurable illnesses, making it a target for poachers and traditional healers. As the middle stage of a Pseudo-Legendary line, it possesses significant latent power, eventually maturing into the terrifying Garchomp, which is capable of Mega Evolution.
