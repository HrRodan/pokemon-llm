## Identity & Lore
Accelgor (Pokedex #617) is the Shell Out Pokémon, a sinister and remarkably swift creature first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Following a unique evolutionary process where it sheds its heavy shell, its body becomes light and agile, though it remains extremely vulnerable to dehydration. To counteract this, it wraps its body in multiple layers of thin, cloth-like membranes, giving it the distinct appearance of a swift ninja or a masked raider. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Accelgor is famous in the Pokémon world for its rivalry with Escavalier—the Pokémon that effectively "stole" its shell during their simultaneous evolution. It typically inhabits damp environments where it can maintain its moisture levels, using its blinding speed to strike from the shadows before an opponent can react.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 70, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 145.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Suicide Lead. With a base Speed of 145, Accelgor is one of the fastest non-legendary Pokémon in existence, allowing it to act as a premier entry-hazard setter or a glass-cannon attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Flying, and Rock**. It maintains natural **resistances to Fighting, Ground, and Grass** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and unmatched Speed, Accelgor excels with moves such as **Bug Buzz** for powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Focus Blast** for high-power coverage against Steel and Rock types, **Sludge Bomb** to threaten Fairy types, and **Spikes** or **Toxic Spikes** to capitalize on its ability to move first and set up entry hazards.
* **Abilities:** **Hydration** (Heals status conditions if it is raining), **Sticky Hold** (Prevents the Pokémon’s held item from being taken by other Pokémon), and its Hidden Ability **Unburden** (Doubles its already massive Speed stat if its held item is used or lost, making it virtually impossible to outrun).

## Evolution & Biology
Accelgor is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Shelmet** only when traded specifically for a **Karrablast**; during the trade, Karrablast receives Shelmet's shell to become Escavalier, while Shelmet becomes the shell-less Accelgor. This unique "swap" evolution is one of the few instances in biology where two species must interact to trigger a transformation. Accelgor belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive use. Despite its frail appearance, its biology allows it to utilize moves like **Final Gambit**, where it sacrifices its own remaining HP to deal equivalent damage to the foe—a tactical maneuver often used by trainers to remove a specific threat from the battlefield instantly.
