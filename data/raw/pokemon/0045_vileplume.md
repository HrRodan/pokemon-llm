## Identity & Lore
Vileplume (Pokedex #045) is the Flower Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Poison entity originally discovered in Generation I (Kanto). It is instantly recognizable by the massive, fleshy red flower on its head, which constitutes the majority of its body weight and makes it difficult for the Pokémon to keep its head upright. Vileplume inhabits grasslands and jungles, where it is notorious for shaking its "world's largest petals" to release heavy clouds of toxic pollen. This allergenic yellow pollen is used to paralyze prey or deter predators, causing allergic reactions in humans and Pokémon alike. While it moves slowly due to the weight of its flower, the petals flap loudly when it unleashes its toxins.
