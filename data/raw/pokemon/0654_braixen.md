## Identity & Lore
Braixen (Pokedex #654) is the Fox Pokémon, a bipedal Fire-type creature that represents the middle stage of the Generation VI starter line from the Kalos region. Characterized by its sleek, upright appearance and fox-like features, Braixen is most famous for the twig it carries tucked into its voluminous tail fur. This twig serves as its primary tool for combat and communication; by removing it and using the friction from its fur to ignite the wood, Braixen can brandish the flaming branch like a wand to cast spells or signal to allies. While Braixen itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it eventually evolves into Delphox, which leans even further into the "mage" or "witch" aesthetic. Its design and behavior suggest an increasing level of intelligence and a shift from the purely animalistic nature of its predecessor, Fennekin, toward a more sophisticated, mystical persona.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 59, Attack 59, Defense 58, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 70, Speed 73.
* **Archetype:** Special Attacker / Eviolite Utility. In competitive formats like NFE (Not Fully Evolved), Braixen functions as a potent special threat or a utility disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fire-type, it is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Water**. It **resists Bug, Steel, Grass, Ice, Fire, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack, Braixen excels with moves that utilize its wand-like twig. Key moves include **Flamethrower** for consistent STAB damage, **Fire Blast** for maximum power, **Psychic** to deal with Poison and Fighting types while foreshadowing its future dual-typing, and **Will-O-Wisp** to cripple physical attackers by inflicting burns.
* **Abilities:** **Blaze** increases the power of Fire-type moves by 50% when Braixen's HP falls below a third of its maximum. Its Hidden Ability, **Magician**, allows it to steal the held item of a target it hits with a move, provided Braixen is not already holding an item—a tactically unique trait for disrupting opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Braixen is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the Fire-type starter **Fennekin** starting at **Level 16**. After gaining enough experience and honing its mystical fire-wielding abilities, Braixen evolves into the Fire/Psychic-type **Delphox** starting at **Level 36**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group, and its reproductive cycle is characterized by a hatch counter of 20. Its growth rate is classified as "medium-slow," reflecting the dedication required by a trainer to master its unique blend of fire and burgeoning psychic prowess. Although it no longer runs on all fours, it retains the keen senses and agility of its vulpine ancestors, using its flame-lit twig to ward off predators and light up its path through the forests of Kalos.
