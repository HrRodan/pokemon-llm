## Identity & Lore
Mega Absol Z (Pokedex #10307) is the Disaster Pokémon, a specialized and heightened form of the Hoenn-native species first discovered in Generation III. Standing as a quadrupedal omen of calamity, this variant inhabits rugged mountain ranges where its sensitive horn can detect subtle changes in the environment, allowing it to predict natural disasters such as earthquakes and tidal waves. While traditionally misunderstood by humans as the cause of these tragedies, Mega Absol Z represents the pinnacle of this species' protective instincts. This specific "Mega-Z" form manifests a dual Dark and Ghost-type nature, suggesting a spiritual ascension that transcends its standard Mega Evolution. In the Hoenn region, its appearance is often treated with a mixture of reverence and dread, as it emerges from the peaks to warn those in the path of impending destruction.

## Evolution & Biology
Absol is part of a unique evolutionary line that does not feature standard stage-based evolutions. Instead, it accesses this Mega-Z form through the use of a specialized Mega Stone or unique regional phenomenon. The biology of Mega Absol Z is characterized by its white fur and its heightened agility. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, and despite its intimidating reputation, it has a base happiness of 35. Trainers looking to breed this species should note its medium-slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 25, requiring significant dedication to raise from an egg found in mountainous habitats.
