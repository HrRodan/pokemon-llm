## Identity & Lore
Murkrow (Pokedex #198) is the Darkness Pokémon, a dual-type Dark/Flying avian creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its black plumage and a distinct crest resembling a witch's hat, Murkrow is historically feared and loathed by superstitious travelers who believe it brings misfortune to those who see it at night. This Pokémon inhabits deep forests and swamps, where it engages in thievery, showing a strong attraction to shiny objects which it hoards in its nest. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is notable for being the only Pokémon prior to Generation IV to utilize the Dusk Stone for evolution.
