## Identity & Lore
Heliolisk (Pokedex #695) is the Generator Pokémon, a bipedal, reptilian species first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. It is easily recognized by the large, retractable frill around its neck which it flares to absorb sunlight, converting solar energy into massive amounts of electricity. According to ecological records, a single Heliolisk can generate enough power to supply a skyscraper. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique yellow-and-black aesthetic and "upright" shape make it a distinctive inhabitant of sunny, arid environments where it can bask to recharge. Its biology is a marvel of renewable energy, often associated with high-tech urban environments and power plants within the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 62, Attack 55, Defense 52, Sp. Atk 109, Sp. Def 94, Speed 109.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. Heliolisk excels at outspeeding mid-tier threats and delivering powerful special attacks, though its physical fragility makes it a "glass cannon."
* **Type Matchups:** As an Electric/Normal type, it is **weak to Ground and Fighting**. It possesses a vital **Immunity to Ghost** and **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Thunderbolt** for reliable STAB damage, **Hyper Voice** to utilize its Normal typing, **Volt Switch** for tactical pivoting, and **Surf**—a rare coverage move for an Electric type that allows it to counter its Ground-type weakness.
* **Abilities:** **Dry Skin** (Restores HP in rain or when hit by Water moves, but increases Fire damage taken), **Sand Veil** (Boosts evasion during sandstorms), and **Solar Power** (Increases Special Attack by 50% in harsh sunlight at the cost of HP each turn). These abilities make Heliolisk a premier "Weather Warrior," capable of fitting into Rain, Sand, or Sun teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Heliolisk is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Helioptile** only when exposed to the radiation of a **Sun Stone**, a trigger that reflects its lore as a solar-powered organism. Biologically, it is highly versatile, belonging to both the **Monster and Dragon** Egg Groups, suggesting an ancient saurian lineage. With a hatch counter of 20, breeders find it a relatively standard Pokémon to raise. Despite its desert-dwelling appearance, its ability to thrive in various climates—especially rain due to Dry Skin—makes it one of the most biologically adaptable reptiles in the Pokémon kingdom.
