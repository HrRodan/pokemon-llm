## Identity & Lore
Deerling (Pokedex #585) is the Season Pokémon, a quadrupedal creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Its most defining characteristic is its ability to change its appearance based on the changing seasons, shifting its fur color and scent to camouflage perfectly with mountain grass. This species manifests in four distinct seasonal forms: Spring (Pink), Summer (Green), Autumn (Orange), and Winter (Brown). In the wild, Deerling are known to be shy and cautious; they use their heightened senses to detect hostility and will immediately hide in dense vegetation to avoid conflict. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Sawsbuck, carries on its seasonal transformation with even more dramatic foliage changes.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Physical Utility Attacker. In competitive formats like Little Cup, Deerling functions as a fast physical pivot or a sun-based sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types, and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost** moves due to its Normal typing.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Attack and Speed over its Special Attack, Deerling excels with physical maneuvers such as **Seed Bomb** for Grass-type STAB, **Double-Edge** or **Take Down** for high-power Normal-type damage, **Jump Kick** for vital coverage against Steel and Rock types, and **Wild Charge** or **Play Rough** to surprise opponents.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Chlorophyll:** Doubles Deerling’s Speed stat during harsh sunlight, making it a dangerous "Sun Sweeper." 
    * **Sap Sipper:** Grants immunity to Grass-type moves and boosts its Attack stat by one stage when hit by one, providing an excellent switch-in opportunity. 
    * **Serene Grace (Hidden):** Doubles the chance of moves having secondary effects, which can be useful with moves like Headbutt to increase flinch rates.

## Evolution & Biology
Deerling is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Sawsbuck once it reaches **Level 34**. As a member of the **Ground** (Field) egg group, it shares breeding compatibility with a wide variety of land-based mammals. Biologically, its transformation is triggered by temperature and humidity, reflecting the environmental shifts of the Unova, Kalos, and Paldea regions. Trainers often value Deerling not just for its battle prowess, but as a living thermometer of the natural world.
