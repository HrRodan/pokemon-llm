## Identity & Lore
Plusle (Pokedex #311) is the Cheering Pokémon, a spirited Electric-type rodent introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Characterized by its cream fur, red ears, and plus-shaped tail, this Pokémon is inextricably linked to its partner, Minun. Primarily inhabiting grasslands, Plusle is defined by its supportive nature; it creates crackling spark noises by shorting out its body to cheer for its teammates in battle. If its partner loses, Plusle cries loudly. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is a well-known archetype of the "electric rodent" family, representing positive electrical charge.
