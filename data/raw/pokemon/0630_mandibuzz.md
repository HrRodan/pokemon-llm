## Identity & Lore
Mandibuzz (Pokedex #630) is the Bone Vulture Pokémon, a formidable avian species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its somewhat macabre aesthetic, Mandibuzz constructs its nests entirely out of bones it scavenges, often circling the skies to find weakened prey to haul back to its skeletal lair. It is a female-only species, serving as the darker, more defensive counterpart to the heroic Braviary. While Mandibuzz does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its presence in later regions like Alola and Galar has solidified its reputation as a premier aerial predator and a scavenger that plays a vital role in the ecosystem's waste management. Its brown plumage is decorated with bone-like ornaments, which are actually the remains of the prey it has consumed or scavenged.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 65, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 95, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Pivot / Physical Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dark/Flying type, it is **weak to Electric, Ice, Rock, and Fairy**. It possesses a crucial **immunity to Ground and Psychic** moves and **resists Grass, Ghost, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its modest offensive stats, Mandibuzz excels in utility and using the opponent's strength against them. Key moves in its arsenal include **Foul Play** (which calculates damage based on the target's Attack stat), **Roost** (reliable recovery to leverage its massive HP pool), **Defog** (to clear entry hazards like Stealth Rock), and **Knock Off** (to remove the opponent's held items).
* **Abilities:** **Big Pecks** prevents its Defense from being lowered by opponents; **Overcoat** grants total immunity to weather-based damage like Sandstorm and powder-based moves like Spore or Sleep Powder; **Weak Armor** (Hidden) trades Defense for a massive Speed boost when hit by a physical attack.

## Evolution & Biology
Mandibuzz is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Vullaby** starting at **Level 54**, one of the highest level requirements for a non-pseudo-legendary Pokémon, reflecting the bird's slow maturation and the harsh conditions of its habitat. Biology-wise, Mandibuzz is famous for its "bone-wearing" habits; while Vullaby wears a skull as a protective diaper, the mature Mandibuzz uses bones as decorative and structural elements for its nest and person. It belongs to the **Flying** egg group. Because the species is entirely female, it must breed with other members of the Flying group to produce Vullaby eggs. Its biology is centered on endurance, with its thick feathers and bone armor allowing it to survive in arid deserts and rocky canyons.
