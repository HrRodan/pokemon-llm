## Identity & Lore
Pikipek (Pokedex #731) is the Woodpecker Pokémon, first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This black-feathered avian is a common sight in Alolan forests, where it is famous for its incredible pecking speed, capable of striking wood 16 times per second. These rapid-fire strikes allow it to drill deep holes in trees, which it utilizes for both nesting and storing food items like berries. While Pikipek does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the foundational stage for one of the most powerful avian lines in the tropics, eventually culminating in the formidable Toucannon. In the wild, Pikipek are known to signal one another by the sound of their pecking, creating rhythmic patterns that echo through the canopy.

    * **Pickup (Hidden Ability):** Provides utility outside of combat by allowing the Pokémon to find held items such as Rare Candies or its signature Oran Berry.

## Evolution & Biology
Pikipek is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It undergoes its first transformation into **Trumbeak** upon reaching Level 14. The cycle concludes when Trumbeak evolves into **Toucannon** at Level 28, a Pokémon known for its heated beak and signature move, Beak Blast. Pikipek belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive stats. Biologically, it is extremely industrious, often seen carrying Oran Berries to its hollowed-out tree nests to prepare for the winter or for raising its young.
