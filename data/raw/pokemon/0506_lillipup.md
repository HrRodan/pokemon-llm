## Identity & Lore
Lillipup (Pokédex #506) is the Puppy Pokémon, a Normal-type creature introduced in Generation V (Unova). Resembling a terrier, this brown, quadrupedal Pokémon possesses a shroud of long fur covering its face, which acts as a sensitive radar to detect the condition of its surroundings. Known for its keen intelligence and caution, Lillipup displays immense courage against strong opponents but will pragmatically flee if the disadvantage is too great, ensuring its survival. Its facial fur is vital for gathering information, allowing it to explore its environment safely. While it does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its final evolution, Stoutland, is revered in various regions for its rescue capabilities and role as a Ride Pokémon in Alola.
