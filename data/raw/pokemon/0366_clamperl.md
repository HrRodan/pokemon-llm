## Identity & Lore
Clamperl (Pokedex #366) is the Bivalve Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in the sea, this blue-shelled Pokémon is characterized by its sturdy outer casing, which serves a dual purpose: providing high-defense protection and functioning as a weapon to clamp down on prey. Biological studies note that a fully grown Clamperl's shell is often scored with nicks and scratches, serving as evidence of its survival in harsh aquatic environments. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, Clamperl is unique for its reliance on specific deep-sea items to determine its evolutionary path.

## Evolution & Biology
Clamperl is the base stage of a split, 2-stage evolutionary line. Its evolution depends entirely on the item held during a trade:
