## Identity & Lore
Misdreavus (Pokédex #200) is the Ghost-type Screech Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Visually distinct by the red, jewel-like spheres around its neck, this gray, levitating spirit inhabits dark caves and nocturnal environments. It is infamous for its mischievous nature, thriving on the fear of others; it absorbs the psychic energy generated by fear into its red orbs to nourish itself. To generate this energy, Misdreavus actively pulls pranks, such as yanking hair or emitting piercing, human-like wails and screams to startle travelers. While usually solitary, it shares a striking biological resemblance to the ancient Paradox Pokémon, **Flutter Mane**, discovered in the Great Crater of Paldea.

## Evolution & Biology
Misdreavus is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Mismagius** when exposed to a **Dusk Stone**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Group. Its body is non-corporeal, allowing it to pass through solid walls, which aids in its ambush tactics for scaring prey.
