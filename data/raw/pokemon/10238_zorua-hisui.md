## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Zorua (Pokedex #10238) is the Tricky Fox Pokémon, a unique regional variant discovered in the ancient Hisui region (the precursor to modern-day Sinnoh). Unlike its Unovan counterpart, Hisuian Zorua is a Normal and Ghost-type, said to be the reborn soul of a Zorua that perished after being driven from its home by humans and succumbing to the harsh Hisuian climate. Its grayish-white fur is stained with lingering resentment, which manifests as ghostly, wispy energy. It frequently uses its illusions to mimic the appearance of other creatures or silent human children to lure people into dangerous situations or simply to protect its territory. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved state, Hisuian Zoroark, is a legendary-tier illusionist known for its signature spite-filled combat style.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 60, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 40, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Attacker / Revenge Killer. In competitive Little Cup tiers, it serves as a glass cannon that relies on its unique typing to find safe entries.
* **Type Matchups:** It possesses one of the best defensive typing combinations in the game, granting it **Immunities to Normal, Fighting, and Ghost**. It is only **weak to Dark**, while it **resists Poison and Bug**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack, Hisuian Zorua excels with moves like **Shadow Ball** (high-damage Ghost STAB), **Bitter Malice** (a signature Hisuian move that deals damage and lowers the opponent's Attack), **Nasty Plot** (to sharply boost its offensive pressure), and **Hyper Beam** or **Tera Blast** for powerful Normal-type coverage.
* **Abilities:** **Illusion** (The Pokémon enters the battlefield disguised as the last conscious Pokémon in the trainer's party, forcing the opponent to guess its true identity and potentially waste a move on an immunity).

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Zorua is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Hisuian Zoroark** once it reaches **Level 30**. Its biology is deeply tied to its ghostly nature; despite its small size (0.7m) and quadrupedal shape, it projects a cold, unsettling aura. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group, and trainers should be prepared for a moderately long development period, as it has a hatch counter of 25 and a medium-slow growth rate. Unlike the standard Dark-type Zorua, this variant's malice is fueled by its past suffering, making it a more temperamental partner for those exploring the frozen tundras of the Alabaster Icelands.
