## Identity & Lore
Axew (Pokedex #610) is the Tusk Pokémon, a bipedal, olive-green reptilian creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by the large, protruding tusks on the sides of its jaw, Axew uses these appendages to crush hard berries and mark its territory by carving trees. These tusks are somewhat fragile in early life and can break, but they possess a remarkable regenerative ability, growing back stronger and sharper each time they shatter. While Axew itself does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, it is the initial stage of one of the most feared physical powerhouses in the Dragon-type pantheon, Haxorus. In the wild, it is known to be shy but determined, often found dwelling in deep caves or rocky mountainous areas where it can sharpen its tusks in solitude.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 46, Attack 87, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 40, Speed 57.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper. Despite being a first-stage Pokémon, its base Attack is exceptionally high, allowing it to punch through defenses that other unevolved Pokémon cannot.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides valuable defensive utility by **resisting Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Axew relies heavily on its physical prowess and setup potential. Key moves include **Dragon Dance** to boost its Speed and Attack, **Dragon Claw** for consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Poison Jab** to counter its weakness to Fairy-types, and **Swords Dance** for rapid offensive escalation.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Mold Breaker:** A highly competitive ability that allows Axew’s moves to ignore the defensive abilities of opponents (e.g., hitting Pokémon that have Levitate with Ground-type moves like Bulldoze).
    * **Rivalry:** Increases damage dealt to Pokémon of the same gender but decreases it against the opposite gender.
    * **Unnerve (Hidden):** Prevents opposing Pokémon from eating their held Berries, disrupting many common defensive strategies.

## Evolution & Biology
Axew is the first stage of a powerful three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Fraxure** starting at **Level 38**, which later evolves into the formidable **Haxorus** starting at **Level 48**. This late evolution cycle is characteristic of "pseudo-legendary" adjacent Dragon lines, requiring significant investment from a trainer. Axew belongs to the **Monster and Dragon** Egg Groups, and with a slow growth rate and a high hatch counter of 40, it is considered a rare and difficult Pokémon to breed and raise to maturity. Its biology is centered around the mineral composition of its tusks, which serve as both its primary tool for survival and its main weapon in combat.
