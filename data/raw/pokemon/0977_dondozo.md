## Identity & Lore
Dondozo (Pokedex #977) is the Big Catfish Pokémon, a massive aquatic titan first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This blue, gargantuan fish reaches lengths of 12 meters, making it one of the largest non-legendary Pokémon in existence. Despite its intimidating size and gluttonous appetite, Dondozo is notoriously poor at hunting on its own. It has developed a unique symbiotic—and arguably subservient—relationship with the small, dragon-like Tatsugiri. In this partnership, Tatsugiri acts as the "commander," nesting inside Dondozo's mouth to issue strategic orders, while Dondozo provides the raw physical power. While it currently possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famously recognized as one of the "Titans" encountered in the Path of Legends, where its sheer bulk and "False Dragon" reputation make it a formidable obstacle in Casseroya Lake.

## Evolution & Biology
Dondozo is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. However, its biology is fundamentally tied to Tatsugiri; in Double Battles, Dondozo's "Order Up" move grants it specific stat boosts depending on the form of Tatsugiri it has "swallowed" via the Commandeer ability. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and is known for its slow growth rate, reflecting the immense amount of sustenance required to maintain its 220.0 kg frame. It is primarily found in deep lake environments where it can act as a heavy-duty predator under the guidance of its smaller partner.
