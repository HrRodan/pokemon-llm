## Identity & Lore
Alolan Raichu (Pokedex #10100) is the dual-type Electric/Psychic Mouse Pokémon, representing a unique regional evolution found in the Alola region of Generation VII. Unlike its Kanto counterpart, Alolan Raichu has developed psychic abilities that allow it to use its broad, rounded tail as a literal surfboard, hovering in the air via telekinesis. This adaptation is rumored among Alolans to be the result of a diet rich in sweet, fluffy pancakes, though researchers attribute it to environmental factors. Its fur is a deep mahogany color, and its large ears are rounded and soft compared to the jagged features of the original form. While Alolan Raichu does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form of its own, its pre-evolution, Pikachu, is famous for its Gigantamax capabilities. This Pokémon is deeply tied to the coastal culture of Alola, often seen "surfing" through the air near forest edges and beaches.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Raichu is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Pichu**, a Baby Pokémon that evolves into **Pikachu** when leveled up with High Friendship (minimum 220 happiness). To obtain the Alolan form, a Pikachu must be exposed to a **Thunder Stone** while within the Alola region; otherwise, it would typically evolve into the standard Electric-type Raichu. Biologically, it is categorized under the **Ground and Fairy** Egg Groups, with a relatively fast hatching cycle (hatch counter 10). Its physiology is specialized for "static surfing," where it gathers electricity in its tail to create a platform of psychic energy, allowing it to glide effortlessly above the ground to avoid its primary weakness to Ground-type maneuvers.
