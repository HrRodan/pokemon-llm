## Identity & Lore
Skorupi (Pokedex #451) is the Scorpion Pokémon, a dual-type Poison/Bug creature indigenous to the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). Visually distinct due to its purple, armor-like carapace and massive claws extending from its tail, Skorupi is defined by its tenacity and patience. Lore dictates that it grips prey with these tail claws, injecting poison and refusing to release its hold until the toxin is fatal; it is capable of surviving for an entire year without food while waiting for an opportunity to strike. Commonly found in marshy environments such as the Great Marsh, its biology is surprisingly hardy, reflected in its high physical defense.

## Evolution & Biology
Skorupi is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Drapion** starting at **Level 40**. A notable biological shift occurs during this evolution: Drapion abandons the Bug type to become a Poison/Dark type, drastically altering its weakness profile by shedding weaknesses to Fire, Flying, Rock, and Psychic in exchange for a sole weakness to Ground. Skorupi belongs to the **Bug** and **Water 3** Egg Groups.
