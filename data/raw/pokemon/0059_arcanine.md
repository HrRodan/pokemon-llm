## Identity & Lore
Arcanine (Pokedex #059), classified as the Legendary Pokémon, is a majestic canine entity originating from Generation I (Kanto). Despite its classification and regal appearance, it is not a mythical legend but rather a powerful, commonly admired Pokémon known for its extreme speed and loyalty. Its appearance is characterized by a grand, flowing mane and orange fur with black stripes. Lore states that this Pokémon has been cherished for centuries due to its beauty and runs so agilely that it appears to be moving "as if on wings," allowing it to cover 6,200 miles in a single day and night. While this profile details the pure Fire-type Kantonian form, a Rock/Fire regional variant known as Hisuian Arcanine existed in the ancient Hisui region.
