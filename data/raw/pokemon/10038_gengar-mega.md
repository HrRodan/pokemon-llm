## Identity & Lore
Mega Gengar (Pokedex #10038) is the Shadow Pokémon, representing the pinnacle of Gengar's spectral power through the phenomenon of Mega Evolution. Originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I), this purple, phantom-like entity transforms into a more menacing form that appears partially sunken into the ground, as if emerging from another dimension. According to lore, under a full moon, this Pokémon delights in mimicking the shadows of people and laughing at their fright. While Gengar is its base form, it also possesses the potential for **Gigantamaxing**, where it transforms into a massive, cavernous maw capable of swallowing everything. As a Mega Evolution, it gains a third eye on its forehead, allowing it to see into other dimensions and track its prey with terrifying precision.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Gengar is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, temporary triggered by the Gengarite Mega Stone. It begins its life as **Gastly**, a gaseous entity that evolves into **Haunter** upon reaching Level 25. To reach its true potential as **Gengar**, Haunter must be traded between trainers. While in its base form, it belongs to the **Indeterminate** Egg Group and is known to inhabit caves and urban areas where shadows are plentiful. Its biological cycle is relatively slow, indicated by a hatch counter of 20 and a medium-slow growth rate. Biology experts note its weight increases to 40.5 kg in this form, suggesting its spectral density hardens as it manifests its Mega-evolved power.
