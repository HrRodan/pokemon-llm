## Identity & Lore
Alomomola (Pokedex #594) is the Caring Pokémon, a large, pink, heart-shaped fish that first appeared in the Unova region during Generation V. This aquatic species is renowned throughout the Pokémon world for its incredible compassion and medicinal properties; it uses its special fins to embrace injured Pokémon, healing their wounds with a unique membrane that envelops its body. While its appearance frequently leads observers to believe it is an evolution of the Hoenn-native Luvdisc, Alomomola is biologically distinct and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is typically found drifting in the open ocean, often followed by smaller fish Pokémon that benefit from its protective nature. Alomomola does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts, maintaining a consistent biological profile across all known regions.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 165, Attack 75, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 45, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank and Cleric. Its massive HP pool makes it one of the most resilient defensive pivots in the game, specifically tailored to absorb physical hits.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** types. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack relative to its Special Attack and its legendary utility, key moves include **Wish** (passing massive heals to teammates), **Flip Turn** (providing momentum and pivoting), **Liquidation** (a reliable physical STAB move), and **Mirror Coat** (to punish special attackers who exploit its lower Special Defense).
* **Abilities:** **Healer** (sometimes heals an ally's status condition in doubles), **Hydration** (heals status conditions if it is raining), and its highly coveted Hidden Ability, **Regenerator**, which restores one-third of Alomomola's maximum HP every time it switches out of battle, making it nearly impossible to wear down.

## Evolution & Biology
Alomomola is a single-stage Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It does not evolve from Luvdisc, despite the visual similarities in their heart-shaped silhouettes. Biologically, it is a maritime nurturer, often acting as a mobile "healing station" for other sea creatures. It belongs to the **Water 1 and Water 2** Egg Groups, and with a Hatch Counter of 40, it requires significant effort to breed. In competitive environments, it is often paired with "Regenerator Cores" to create a defensive backbone that exhausts the opponent through attrition and consistent self-healing.
