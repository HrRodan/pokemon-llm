## Identity & Lore
Glimmora (#970) is the Ore Pokémon, a dual-type Rock and Poison-type creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It possesses a striking, non-organic appearance characterized by a conical body surrounded by six crystalline blue petals that resemble a blooming flower or a large mineral formation. When it senses danger, Glimmora unfurls these petals to fire concentrated energy beams from its core. Lore suggests a deep biological connection between Glimmora and the Terastal phenomenon; its crystalline structure closely mirrors the Tera Jewels found in the depths of Area Zero and the Great Crater of Paldea. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famously known as the signature Pokémon of Geeta, the Top Champion of the Paldea Pokémon League, often serving as her final ace or a strategic lead.

## Evolution & Biology
Glimmora is the second and final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Glimmet** once it reaches **Level 35**. Biologically, Glimmora is unique in its "ball" shape and mineral composition, behaving more like a living crystal than a biological organism. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and its growth rate is categorized as medium-slow. In the wild, it is most commonly found clinging to cave walls in high-energy environments, particularly within the lower strata of Area Zero, where it thrives on the unique mineral deposits found there.
