## Identity & Lore
Nidorina (Pokedex #030) is the Poison Pin Pokémon, a pure Poison-type creature first discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Residing primarily in grasslands, this blue, quadrupedal Pokémon is known for its docile nature compared to its male counterpart, though it will fight fiercely to protect its colony. Unlike its pre-evolution, Nidorina's horn grows slowly, leading it to prefer physical attacks involving clawing and biting over horn-based strikes. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a crucial middle stage in one of Kanto's most iconic evolutionary lines. A unique biological anomaly occurs at this stage: while female, Nidorina loses the ability to reproduce effectively in captivity, placing it in the Undiscovered Egg Group alongside its evolution, Nidoqueen.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 62, Defense 67, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 55, Speed 56.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Brawler / Eviolite Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Poison-type, Nidorina is **weak to Ground and Psychic** attacks. It naturally **resists Grass, Fighting, Poison, Bug, and Fairy** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its slightly higher Attack stat and "Hustle" ability, an optimal move set includes **Poison Jab** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Crunch** for Psychic-type coverage, **Stomping Tantrum** to handle Steel and Poison types, and **Toxic Spikes** for entry hazard utility.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Poison Point:** Contact with this Pokémon has a 30% chance of poisoning the attacker.
    *   **Rivalry:** Deals more damage to Pokémon of the same gender, but less damage to the opposite gender.
    *   **Hustle (Hidden Ability):** Boosts Attack by 50% but lowers physical move accuracy by 20%, turning Nidorina into a high-risk, high-reward physical attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Nidorina is the second stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Nidoran♀** starting at **Level 16**. To reach its final form, **Nidoqueen**, Nidorina must be exposed to a **Moon Stone**; this evolution can occur at any level provided the item is used. As noted in its lore, despite evolving from a breeding-capable Pokémon, Nidorina belongs to the **No Eggs (Undiscovered)** group, meaning it cannot produce Eggs at the Pokémon Day Care.
