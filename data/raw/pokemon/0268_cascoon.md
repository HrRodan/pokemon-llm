## Identity & Lore
Cascoon (Pokedex #268) is the Cocoon Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A pure **Bug-type**, this immobile Pokémon resides primarily in forests where it hides underneath large leaves. Cascoon creates its protective shell by wrapping its body entirely in fine purple silk ejected from its mouth; once the silk surrounds the body, it hardens into a tough carapace. Unlike its counterpart Silcoon, which hangs from branches, Cascoon often stays closer to the ground or hidden in shadows. It is characterized by its endurance; it never forgets the pain of attacks it receives while in this vulnerable state, intending to seek revenge upon its evolution. Inside the cocoon, all of its cells are undergoing a rigorous reformation to prepare for its metamorphosis.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 35, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 25, Speed 15.
*   **Archetype:** Early-Game Physical Wall / Transitional Stage.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Bug-type, it is **weak to Fire, Flying, and Rock**. It **resists Fighting, Grass, and Ground** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its limited mobility and defensive nature, its move pool is small. Key moves include **Iron Defense** (to bolster its respectable physical bulk), **Bug Bite** (utilizing its Attack stat for STAB damage), **Electroweb** (for speed control and coverage), and **Poison Sting** (to fish for poison status).
*   **Abilities:** **Shed Skin** (At the end of each turn, this Pokémon has a 33% chance to heal any non-volatile status condition, ensuring it survives long enough to evolve).

## Evolution & Biology
Cascoon is the middle stage of a split 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Wurmple** starting at **Level 7**.
*   **Unique Evolution Mechanic:** The evolution from Wurmple into Cascoon (rather than Silcoon) is determined by Wurmple's hidden **personality value** (encryption constant), making the outcome essentially random to the trainer but predetermined upon catching the Wurmple.
*   **Final Stage:** Cascoon evolves into **Dustox** starting at **Level 10**.
*   **Biology:** It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group. While waiting for evolution, its body temperature increases, and cracks may appear on its shell when it is close to hatching.
