## Identity & Lore
Samurott (Pokedex #503) is the **Formidable Pokémon**, originally discovered in **Generation V (Unova)**. A quadrupedal, blue sea lion-like creature, it is known for the plated armor covering its body, which conceals "seamitars"—swords incorporated into its forelegs. According to lore, one swing of these swords can fell an opponent, and a simple glare from a Samurott can quiet an entire room. While primarily found in the Unova region, historical records from the Hisui region indicate the existence of a regional variant, **Hisuian Samurott** (Water/Dark), which adopted a more ruthless fighting style. This profile focuses on the standard Unovan form.

## Evolution & Biology
Samurott is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line, serving as the Water-type Starter Pokémon for Unova. It evolves from **Dewott** starting at **Level 36**, which in turn evolves from **Oshawott** at **Level 17**. Unlike its bipedal pre-evolutions, Samurott returns to a quadrupedal stance to support its heavy armor. It belongs to the **Field** Egg Group (listed as "ground" in data structure).
