## Identity & Lore
Yamask (Pokedex #562) is the Spirit Pokémon, a somber and tragic entity first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a shadow-like figure with golden eyes and two long, arm-like appendages, it is most famous for carrying a gold mask that represents its face from when it was human in a past life. This Pokémon is known to wander ancient ruins, occasionally gazing at its mask and crying, a testament to its lingering memories. While the standard Unovan form is a pure Ghost-type, a distinct variant known as **Galarian Yamask** exists in the Galar region, possessing a Ground/Ghost typing and carrying a cursed clay slab instead of a mask. Though it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved state, Cofagrigus, is legendary for its defensive prowess in competitive history.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 38, Attack 30, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 65, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Trick Room Setter. Despite its low base stat total, its high physical Defense makes it surprisingly resilient in lower competitive tiers.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost and Dark** types. It possesses crucial **resistances to Poison and Bug**, and is completely **immune to Normal and Fighting** moves, allowing it to switch safely into powerful physical strikes.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Shadow Ball** for consistent STAB damage, **Hex** to punish status-afflicted foes, **Will-O-Wisp** to burn and neutralize physical attackers, and **Trick Room** to turn its low Speed into a tactical advantage.
* **Abilities:** Mummy (When the Pokémon is hit by a contact move, the attacker’s Ability is changed to Mummy). This is a devastating disruptive tool that can neutralize top-tier threats by stripping them of essential abilities like Huge Power, Levitate, or Tera Shell.

## Evolution & Biology
Yamask is part of a branching evolutionary line with unique regional requirements. The standard Unovan Yamask evolves into the sarcophagus-like **Cofagrigus** starting at **Level 34**. In contrast, the Galarian variant follows a much more complex ritual, evolving into **Runerigus** after the Pokémon takes at least 49 HP in damage from a single hit and is then walked under the large stone sculpture in the Dusty Bowl of the Galar region. Yamask belongs to the **Mineral and Indeterminate** Egg Groups, and while it is often found in desert ruins or burial chambers, it can be bred with a hatch counter of 25. It is occasionally found in the wild holding a **Spell Tag**, an item that further amplifies its ghostly powers.
