## Identity & Lore
Terapagos (Pokedex #1024) is the Tera Pokémon, a legendary entity that serves as the primordial source of the Terastal phenomenon found within the Paldea region (Generation IX). Appearing as a small, indigo-colored turtle in its "Normal Form," it possesses the unique biological ability to condense energy into incredibly hard, glittering crystals for protection. While its base form is diminutive, Terapagos is a creature of immense power that lay dormant for eons in the depths of Area Zero. Beyond its standard appearance, world knowledge confirms it possesses two significantly more powerful states: the "Terastal Form," which it assumes upon entering battle, and the "Stellar Form," achieved through the power of the Stellar Tera Type. Its shell is adorned with symbols representing every known Pokémon type, reflecting its status as a universal catalyst for Terallization.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 65, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 85, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Form-Shifting Special Tank. While its base stats appear modest, Terapagos is designed to immediately transform using its ability, significantly boosting its bulk and offensive presence.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Normal-type**, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**.
* **Move Selection:** Terapagos excels when utilizing its wide special movepool and signature attacks. Key moves include **Tera Starstorm** (a powerful signature move that hits all opponents in Stellar Form), **Earth Power** for coverage against Steel and Rock types, **Calm Mind** to boost its Special stats, and **Rapid Spin** to clear entry hazards like Stealth Rock while boosting its own Speed.
* **Abilities:** **Tera Shift** (The Pokémon transforms into its Terastal Form the moment it enters the battlefield, drastically altering its base stats and defensive capabilities). In its other forms, it gains access to **Tera Shell**, which ensures that damage taken at full HP is always "not very effective," and **Teraform Zero**, which nullifies weather and terrain effects upon transformation.

## Evolution & Biology
Terapagos is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. However, it undergoes significant biological metamorphoses through Terastallization. It belongs to the **No-Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, Terapagos is linked to the crystalline structures of the Underdepths of Area Zero, where it has slept since the ancient past. Its growth rate is **Slow**, requiring a vast amount of experience to reach its full potential. Despite its small stature of 0.2 meters and weight of 6.5 kg in its base form, its shell contains the concentrated energy of the planet's crust, making it one of the most significant discoveries in Paldean ecological history.
