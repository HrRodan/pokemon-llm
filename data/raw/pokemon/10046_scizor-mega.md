## Identity & Lore
Mega Scizor (Pokedex #10046) is the Pincer Pokémon, a formidable Bug and Steel-type evolution that represents the pinnacle of Scizor's combat potential. Originally discovered in the Johto region (Generation II), Scizor is characterized by its crimson, steel-hard exoskeleton and its large, eye-patterned pincers used to intimidate rivals. Upon undergoing Mega Evolution, Scizor’s body becomes more mechanized; its pincers transform into heavy, serrated shears capable of ripping through solid concrete. While Scizor primarily inhabits grasslands, its Mega Form is a temporary state achieved only in battle through the resonance between a Scizorite Mega Stone and its trainer. Beyond its Mega Evolution, the Scizor lineage has further expanded with the discovery of Kleavor, a prehistoric divergent evolution of Scyther found in the Hisui region.

## Combat Profile

* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive base 150 Attack, Mega Scizor excels with **Bullet Punch** (providing necessary priority), **U-turn** for pivoting and momentum, **Swords Dance** to further boost its offensive pressure, and **Roost** to capitalize on its high Defense and maintain longevity.
* **Abilities:** Technician (Increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%). This is most effectively utilized with Bullet Punch, transforming it into a high-priority, high-damage STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Scizor is part of a complex, branching evolutionary line. It evolves from Scyther when **traded while holding a Metal Coat**, turning Scyther's agile, mantis-like frame into a heavily armored, metallic body. Scyther can also evolve into the Bug/Rock-type Kleavor when exposed to **Black Augurite** in the Hisui region. Scizor can only achieve its Mega Form during battle. Biologically, Scizor belongs to the **Bug** egg group and is known for its extreme physical density, weighing 125.0 kg despite its relatively compact 2.0-meter height. Its biology is centered on its pincers, which contain enough clamping force to crush any material, and its wings, which—while no longer capable of sustained flight—can flap at high speeds to regulate its body temperature during intense combat.
