## Identity & Lore
Mega Gyarados (#10041) is the Atrocious Pokémon, a colossal and hyper-aggressive transformation of the iconic Kanto-region serpent first discovered in Generation I. Standing at 6.5 meters and weighing 305 kg, this form is achieved when a Gyarados undergoes Mega Evolution using a Gyaradosite, a process that significantly hardens its body and alters its elemental alignment from Water/Flying to Water/Dark. Its biology is defined by its legendary destructive instincts; once it begins a rampage, it will not cease until everything in its vicinity is razed, even when facing the fury of a harsh storm. While the base form is commonly found at the waters-edge, Mega Gyarados is a rare sight, manifesting only in the heat of battle through the bond between Pokémon and Trainer.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Gyarados represents the temporary zenith of a three-stage progression. It starts its life as Magikarp, a famously pathetic fish, which evolves into the formidable Gyarados starting at **Level 20**. The transformation into its Mega form is a temporary state triggered during combat. Biologically, it is a member of the **Water 2 and Dragon** Egg Groups, though it possesses a slow growth rate. Despite its dragon-like appearance and belonging to the Dragon Egg Group, its Mega form embraces its "Atrocious" nature through the Dark typing rather than the Dragon type.
