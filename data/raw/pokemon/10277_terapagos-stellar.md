## Identity & Lore
Stellar Form Terapagos (Pokedex #10277) is the definitive, awakened state of the Tera Pokémon, a legendary entity discovered deep within the Underdepths of Area Zero in the Paldea region (Generation IX). This magnificent, blue-hued quadruped is the literal source of the Terastal phenomenon, possessing the unique ability to transform raw energy into indestructible crystals. In its Stellar Form, Terapagos represents the pinnacle of Terastal energy, its shell resembling a cosmic map of all eighteen Pokémon types. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigamax form, this Stellar state is functionally its ultimate "transcendent" form, surpassing its Normal and Terastal forms in sheer power and biological complexity. Lore dictates that it remained dormant for millions of years, fueling the crystalline growth found throughout the Great Crater of Paldea.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 160, Attack 105, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 130, Sp. Def 110, Speed 85.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Tank / Set-up Sweeper. Its massive HP pool and balanced defensive stats make it exceptionally difficult to OHKO.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal type, it is **weak to Fighting**. It possesses a vital **immunity to Ghost**. While it has no natural resistances, its bulk allows it to take neutral hits effectively.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior 130 Base Special Attack, Terapagos-Stellar excels with **Tera Starstorm** (its signature move which, in this form, damages all opponents), **Calm Mind** (to further boost its Special stats), **Earth Power** (for critical coverage against Steel and Rock types), and **Ice Beam** (to threaten Dragon and Ground types).
* **Abilities:** Teraform Zero (Upon entering the battlefield in this form, Terapagos-Stellar instantly eliminates all active weather conditions and terrain effects, effectively neutralizing strategies reliant on Sun, Rain, or Electric/Psychic Terrain).

## Evolution & Biology
Terapagos is a unique specimen that does not follow traditional level-based evolution. It belongs to a single-stage evolutionary line but undergoes dramatic **Form Changes** triggered by the Terastal phenomenon. It starts in its small "Normal Form," shifts into its "Terastal Form" when entering battle, and finally ascends to this "Stellar Form" upon Terastallizing. Biologically, it is an anomaly; it belongs to the **No-Eggs** group and has a **Slow** growth rate, reflecting its status as an ancient, legendary power. Despite its massive weight of 77.0 kg, it maintains a versatile presence on the battlefield, capable of manipulating the very fabric of elemental energy in the Paldean ecosystem.
