## Identity & Lore
Archen (Pokedex #566) is the First Bird Pokémon, a prehistoric species brought back to life from a Plume Fossil. Originally discovered in the Unova region during Generation V, this Rock/Flying-type is considered the ancient ancestor of all modern bird Pokémon. Despite its colorful plumage and avian features, Archen is flightless; it primary dwells in treetops, moving between branches by hopping or gliding short distances. Its yellow, blue, and red coloration suggests a primitive evolutionary link between dinosaurs and birds. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or a specific Paradox counterpart, its evolved form, Archeops, is renowned in the Pokémon world for having higher base stats than many legendary Pokémon, though it is held back by its fragile nature.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 112, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 74, Sp. Def 45, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Physical Glass Cannon. Archen possesses an astronomical Attack stat for an unevolved Pokémon, allowing it to function as a powerful wallbreaker in lower competitive tiers, though its defensive bulk is extremely poor.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Electric, Ice, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug**, and possesses a vital **immunity to Ground-type moves** due to its Flying typing.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Physical Attack, Archen's most effective moves include **Acrobatics** (which doubles in power if the user is not holding an item), **Stone Edge** for heavy STAB damage, **Earthquake** for vital coverage against Steel types, and **U-turn** to pivot out of unfavorable matchups. **Roost** is also a key utility move to keep its HP high.
* **Abilities:** Defeatist (The Pokémon's Attack and Sp. Atk are halved when its HP becomes half or less). This ability is a significant tactical handicap, forcing trainers to use Archen aggressively before it takes damage.

## Evolution & Biology
Archen is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the predatory **Archeops starting at Level 37**. As a Fossil Pokémon, it requires human intervention via resurrection technology to be seen in the modern era. Biologically, it is a versatile breeder belonging to both the **Flying and Water 3 Egg Groups**. It has a relatively slow maturation process, indicated by a hatch counter of 30, and is noted for its "Medium" growth rate. Its diet in the ancient world likely consisted of both flora and small prey, utilizing its sharp beak and "Bite" and "Crunch" moves to defend its territory.
