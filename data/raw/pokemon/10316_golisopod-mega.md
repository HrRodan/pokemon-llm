## Identity & Lore
Mega Golisopod (Pokedex #10316) is the Hard Scale Pokémon, representing a powerful, hypothetical Mega Evolution of the Alolan native Golisopod. First discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII, this Pokémon is characterized by its massive, armored humanoid frame and its devastating claws. According to lore, it is capable of cleaving seawater and even the air itself with a single flashing slash of its giant, sharp appendages. While its base form is known for the "Emergency Exit" tactic, this Mega form gains a refined **Bug/Steel** typing, trading its aquatic nature for a reinforced metallic exoskeleton. This transformation enhances its "Hard Scale" genus, making it one of the most physically imposing threats in the predatory hierarchy of the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 150, Defense 175, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 120, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Wallbreaker. Its immense Defense and Attack stats allow it to absorb heavy physical blows while retaliating with overwhelming force.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Bug/Steel type, it has a notable **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire**. It is immune to **Poison** and possesses a high number of resistances, including **Normal, Grass (quad-resist), Ice, Psychic, Bug, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive 150 Base Attack, Mega Golisopod excels with high-impact physical strikes. Key moves include **First Impression** (for high-priority STAB damage), **Iron Head** (for Steel-type STAB and flinch potential), **Leech Life** (for Bug-type STAB and essential health recovery), and **Liquidation** (to maintain coverage against Fire and Ground types).
* **Abilities:** While traditional Mega Evolutions often possess abilities like *Tough Claws* to boost contact moves or *Filter* to mitigate its extreme Fire weakness, this form focuses on utilizing its reinforced plating to remain on the battlefield far longer than its predecessor.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Golisopod is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Wimpod**, a small and timid Pokémon known for fleeing at the slightest hint of danger. Wimpod evolves into **Golisopod** upon reaching **Level 30**, at which point it sheds its cowardly nature for a battle-hardened stoicism. The transition to its Mega form requires a Mega Stone, pushing its biological armor to its absolute limit. It belongs to the **Bug** and **Water 3** Egg Groups, and despite its steel-like exterior in this form, it retains the biological traits of deep-sea arthropods. Its heavy weight of 148.0 kg and dense shell make it slow-moving but nearly impenetrable.
