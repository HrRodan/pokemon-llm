## Identity & Lore
Victini (Pokedex #494) is the Mythical **Victory Pokémon** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**. A small, cream-colored Pokémon resembling a rabbit or a small rodent, it is defined by the large, V-shaped ears that generate the "V" silhouette. According to Unovan lore, Victini produces an infinite amount of energy within its body and shares it with others by touch; legends state that Trainers with Victini are guaranteed to win any encounter, regardless of the odds. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is historically significant as the only Pokémon listed with the index number #000 in the Unova regional Pokédex, preceding the region's starters.

It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it cannot be bred. In the context of the Generation V games, it was originally found in the Liberty Garden, requiring a special event item (the Liberty Pass) to encounter.
