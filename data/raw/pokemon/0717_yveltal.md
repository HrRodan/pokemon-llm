## Identity & Lore
Yveltal (Pokedex #717) is the Destruction Pokémon, a terrifying avian legendary that embodies the inevitable end of the life cycle. First discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI, this massive red-and-black entity is known as the mascot of *Pokémon Y*. Its lore is chilling; when its life span reaches its end, it is said to absorb the life force of every living creature in the vicinity before retreating into a cocoon to sleep for a thousand years. Its physical form is shaped like the letter "Y," and when its wings and tail feathers spread wide and glow a deep, ominous red, it initiates its life-draining powers. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the direct thematic opposite to Xerneas, the Life Pokémon, and is a core member of the "Aura Trio" alongside Zygarde.

## Evolution & Biology
Yveltal is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is an apex predator of life energy, possessing a wingspan of nearly 6 meters and weighing over 200kg. As a legendary of the Kalos region, it is often tied to the "Ultimate Weapon" created by AZ and sought by Team Flare. Its growth rate is exceptionally slow, reflecting its status as an ancient force of nature that exists outside the standard biological progression of common Pokémon.
