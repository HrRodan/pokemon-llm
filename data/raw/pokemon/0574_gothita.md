## Identity & Lore
Gothita (Pokedex #574) is the Fixation Pokémon, a small humanoid species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its distinct purple skin and white ribbonlike feelers, these feelers are more than mere decoration; they serve as focal points that amplify its innate psychic power. Gothita is notoriously known for its intense, unwavering gaze, often staring at things that are invisible to the human eye, suggesting a sensory perception that extends into other dimensions or spiritual realms. While Gothita itself is the base form, its evolutionary line, culminating in Gothitelle, is often associated with the ability to see the stars and predict the future. Currently, Gothita does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or a Paradox counterpart, remaining a staple of the classic Unovan psychic roster.

## Evolution & Biology
Gothita is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Gothorita** starting at **Level 32**, which subsequently evolves into the final form, **Gothitelle**, at **Level 41**. Biologically, Gothita belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group, reflecting its bipedal, humanoid appearance. It has a medium-slow growth rate and a base happiness of 70. In the wild, Gothita are occasionally found carrying a **Persim Berry**, which they likely use to snap out of confusion caused by their own burgeoning psychic energies. They are primarily found in temperate regions, often drawn to areas where they can observe interesting phenomena to satisfy their fixation.
