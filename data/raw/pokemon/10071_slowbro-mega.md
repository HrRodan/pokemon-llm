## Identity & Lore
Mega Slowbro (Pokedex #10071) is the Mega Evolved form of the Hermit Crab Pokémon, a Water/Psychic-type powerhouse originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). While its base form is known for its vacant expression and the Shellder latched onto its tail, Mega Evolution causes the Shellder to undergo a dramatic transformation, expanding to swallow Slowbro almost entirely. This creates a durable, spiraling iron-hard shell that acts as an impenetrable suit of armor, leaving only Slowbro’s head, arms, and tail exposed. Despite the Shellder's constriction, Slowbro remains characteristically relaxed, though its defensive capabilities are heightened to legendary levels. Beyond its Mega form, the Slowpoke lineage is notable for its branching evolution into Slowking and its unique regional variants found in Galar, where it gains the Poison type.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Slowbro is the final peak of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Slowpoke**, which evolves into **Slowbro** starting at **Level 37** when a Shellder bites its tail. Alternatively, Slowpoke can evolve into Slowking if traded while holding a King's Rock. The transition to Mega Slowbro is a temporary state triggered by the use of a **Slowbronite** Mega Stone in battle. Biologically, it is a highly resilient creature that inhabits water's edge habitats. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, and while it is slow-moving with a base Speed of 30, it is often used effectively in **Trick Room** team compositions to reverse the turn order.
