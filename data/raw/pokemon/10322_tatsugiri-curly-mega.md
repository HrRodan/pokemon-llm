## Identity & Lore
Tatsugiri-Curly-Mega (Pokedex #10322) is the Mimicry Pokémon, a specialized Curly Form variant of the Dragon/Water-type first discovered in the Paldea region (Generation IX). Despite its diminutive size—standing only 0.6 meters tall—this pink-scaled dragon is famously clever and deceptive. In the wild, it employs a sophisticated symbiotic strategy, living inside the mouth of the massive Dondozo to protect itself from predators while providing tactical commands to its host. While Tatsugiri does not have a canonical Mega Evolution in the core Paldean games, this specific Curly-Mega manifestation represents a peak performance state with significantly heightened defensive and offensive capabilities. It is known for its "Curly" stance, which it uses to mimic various types of bait to lure in unsuspecting prey or to signal its partner.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 65, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 125, Speed 92.
* **Archetype:** Special Tanky Sweeper. With a massive Special Attack stat and high Special Defense, it functions as a powerful artillery piece that can withstand significant elemental pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Dragon, Fairy, and Ice**. It provides exceptional defensive utility by possessing a **Double Resistance (4x) to Fire and Water**, and a standard resistance to **Steel**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Special Attack, key moves for this Pokémon include **Draco Meteor** for devastating burst damage, **Hydro Pump** (or **Surf** for consistency) as its primary STAB, **Dragon Pulse** for reliable late-game cleaning, and **Nasty Plot** to further boost its offensive presence.
* **Abilities:** **Commander** (Tatsugiri's signature ability that allows it to jump into Dondozo's mouth, granting Dondozo +2 to all stats) and **Storm Drain** (which provides an immunity to Water-type moves and raises Special Attack when hit).

## Evolution & Biology
Tatsugiri-Curly-Mega is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species; however, it exists in three distinct biological forms: Curly, Droopy, and Stretchy. These forms primarily influence the stat boosts it provides to Dondozo via the move "Order Up" (Curly Form increases Attack). It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and is known for its medium-slow growth rate. Biologically, it is a master of "Mimicry," often feigning weakness to manipulate both allies and enemies. Its biology is uniquely adapted to aquatic environments, though it is frequently seen on land near the shores of Casseroya Lake.
