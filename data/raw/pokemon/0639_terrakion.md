## Identity & Lore
Terrakion (Pokedex #639) is the Cavern Pokémon, a legendary quadrupedal powerhouse first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Characterized by its massive, boulder-like frame and ornate horns, Terrakion is a core member of the "Swords of Justice" alongside Cobalion, Virizion, and Keldeo. Its lore is rooted in altruism and raw power; it famously intervened in human wars to protect Pokémon that had lost their homes, using its strength to crush castle walls and obstacles. While Terrakion does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is spiritually and mechanically linked to the Paldean Future Paradox Pokémon, **Iron Boulder**, which shares its signature physical prowess and ancient warrior aesthetic.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 91, Attack 129, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 72, Sp. Def 90, Speed 108.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. Its high base speed allows it to outpace many threats in the competitive circuit, while its base 129 Attack ensures it hits with devastating force.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Rock/Fighting type, Terrakion is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, Grass, Psychic, and Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Rock, Bug, and Dark** types. 
* **Move Selection:** Maximizing its elite physical offensive stats, Terrakion excels with a moveset consisting of **Close Combat** (its primary high-damage Fighting STAB), **Stone Edge** (essential Rock-type STAB for hitting Flying and Fire types), **Swords Dance** (to set up and sweep through defensive walls), and **Earthquake** (for crucial coverage against Steel and Poison types). It also utilizes **Sacred Sword** to ignore an opponent's defensive stat changes.
* **Abilities:** Justified (Raises the Attack stat by one stage when hit by a Dark-type move, making Terrakion a premier switch-in against predicted Dark-type attacks or "Beat Up" strategies in doubles).

## Evolution & Biology
Terrakion is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. It is a genderless entity within the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, its heavy, stone-like hide provides natural armor, allowing it to withstand the rigors of mountain-dwelling and intense combat. It is typically found in deep, secluded caves like the Trial Chamber, where it remains vigilant against those who would harm Pokémon kind. With a capture rate of 3, it is notoriously difficult to tame, requiring a patient and skilled trainer to earn its respect.
