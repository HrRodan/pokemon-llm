## Identity & Lore
Minior (Pokedex #774), specifically the Violet Meteor form, is a unique Rock/Flying-type Meteor Pokémon originating from the Alola region in Generation VII. Originally making its home in the ozone layer, Minior lives by consuming dust and debris in the atmosphere. Once it has consumed enough material, its outer shell becomes excessively heavy, causing it to plummet to the Earth's surface. While this specific specimen is encased in its brown, rocky "Meteor Form," its internal core is a vibrant violet color. 

Minior is famous for its biological diversity, existing in seven different core colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet) plus a rare black shiny variant. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its "Shields Down" mechanic functions as a natural form change that drastically alters its appearance and combat capabilities once its rocky exterior is shattered.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 100, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Set-up Tank (Meteor Form). In this state, Minior functions as a sturdy platform to prepare for a sweep.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Steel, and Rock**. It **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug**, and possesses a total **Immunity to Ground** due to its Flying type.
* **Move Selection:** While in its Meteor Form, Minior focuses on surviving and preparing for its Core Form's offensive transition. Key moves include **Shell Smash** (to double its offensive pressure), **Power Gem** (primary STAB), **Acrobatics** (highly effective if its held item is consumed), and **Earthquake** (for excellent coverage against Steel and Electric types).
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon is protected from status conditions while in its Meteor Form. When its HP drops below 50%, the shell breaks, revealing the Core Form, which has drastically higher Attack, Special Attack, and Speed, but much lower Defenses).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and its biology is tied to the composition of the atmosphere it inhabited. It has a hatch counter of 25, making it a relatively standard Pokémon to breed for competitive use. 

Though it does not evolve, its "Shields Down" ability acts as a functional evolution during mid-battle. While the Meteor Form (seen here) is specialized for endurance and status immunity, the Core Form is built for high-speed, high-damage output. Trainers often equip Minior with a White Herb to negate the defensive drops from **Shell Smash**, allowing it to remain relatively sturdy until its shell naturally breaks. When found in the wild, it often carries a **Star Piece**, a reflection of its celestial origins.
