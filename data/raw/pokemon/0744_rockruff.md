## Identity & Lore
Rockruff (Pokedex #744) is the Puppy Pokémon, a friendly and loyal quadruped introduced in Generation VII (Alola). Characterized by its brown fur and the sharp, pebble-laden ruff around its neck, it is frequently cited as an ideal companion for beginner trainers due to its sociable nature. However, as Rockruff matures, its disposition becomes increasingly wild and difficult to manage, often signaling its proximity to evolution by howling at the moon. While Rockruff does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form itself, it is unique for its "branching" evolution into three distinct forms of Lycanroc (Midday, Midnight, and Dusk), each reflecting different behavioral traits influenced by the solar or lunar cycle.

## Evolution & Biology
Rockruff is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Lycanroc** starting at Level 25, though the specific form it takes is highly dependent on environmental factors and innate traits. It evolves into **Midday Form** during the day, **Midnight Form** during the night, and the rare **Dusk Form** specifically when leveled up during the evening while possessing the "Own Tempo" ability. Biologically, Rockruff uses the rocks in its neck as a tool for both affection and combat, rubbing them against those it trusts. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, indicating a relatively fast breeding cycle for trainers looking to optimize its stats.
