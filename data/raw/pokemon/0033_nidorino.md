## Identity & Lore
Nidorino (Pokedex #033) is the **Poison Pin Pokémon**, a prominent Poison-type entity indigenous to the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Characterized by its **purple** hide and large, independent ears, this quadrupedal Pokémon inhabits **grasslands** where it roams in search of territory. Nidorino is distinct for its aggressive temperament; it is known to be quick to anger and will charge at foes to impale them with the horn on its head, which secretes a powerful venom upon impact. It represents the male counterpart to the Nidorina species line.

To reach its final form, the imposing **Nidoking**, Nidorino must be exposed to a **Moon Stone**; this evolution is immediate and not level-dependent.
