## Identity & Lore
Starly (Pokedex #396) is the Starling Pokémon, a common sight originating from the **Generation IV (Sinnoh)** region. This brown-plumed avian is known for its gregarious nature, forming massive flocks to protect itself from predators. While an individual Starly is physically small and weak, the collective power of their flock can be overwhelming. Despite their diminutive size, their biology allows them to flap their wings with surprising power. As the "regional bird" of Sinnoh, Starly serves as the initial form of a highly competitive evolutionary line, eventually maturing into the powerful Staraptor, a Pokémon renowned for its aggressive combat capabilities.

## Combat Profile

*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker (Little Cup Sweeper).
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Dual Normal/Flying type, Starly is **weak to Electric, Ice, and Rock**. It **resists Bug and Grass** moves and possesses valuable **immunities to Ground and Ghost** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Attack (55) and Speed (60), Starly's optimal moveset focuses on high-damage physical strikes and momentum. Key moves include **Brave Bird** and **Double-Edge** (which inflict massive damage at the cost of recoil), **U-turn** for pivoting out of unfavorable matchups, and **Quick Attack** for priority finishing blows.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents the Pokémon's accuracy from being lowered.
    *   **Reckless (Hidden Ability):** Increases the power of moves that have recoil damage. This is the preferred ability for Starly, synergizing perfectly with moves like Brave Bird and Double-Edge.

## Evolution & Biology
Starly is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Staravia** starting at **Level 14**, which then evolves into the formidable **Staraptor** starting at **Level 34**. While Starly possesses the **Keen Eye** ability, it is notable that upon evolution, Staravia gains the **Intimidate** ability, drastically changing its utility in battle. Starly belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
