## Identity & Lore
Lairon (Pokedex #305) is the Iron Armor Pokémon, a dual-type Steel/Rock creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A stout, gray quadruped, Lairon inhabits mountainous areas where it aggressively claims territory. Uniquely, this Pokémon tempers its steel body by drinking highly nutritious mineral springwater until bloated, a process that hardens its armor plating. It often makes its nest close to these springs and will clash with others to defend its access to the water. While Lairon itself does not possess alternate forms, its final evolution, Aggron, is capable of Mega Evolution.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 90, Defense 140, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Physical Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** Lairon possesses significant defensive vulnerabilities, suffering from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fighting and Ground** types, as well as a standard weakness to Water. However, it boasts an immunity to Poison and a vast array of resistances, including Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Defense and respectable Attack, key moves include **Iron Head** and **Stone Edge** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Body Press** to utilize its 140 Base Defense for offensive damage, and **Double-Edge** to inflict heavy damage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP.
    *   **Rock Head:** Protects the Pokémon from recoil damage (synergizing effectively with moves like Double-Edge).
    *   **Heavy Metal (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon's weight, increasing the power of weight-based moves like Heavy Slam.

## Evolution & Biology
Lairon is the second stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the Monster Egg Group. It evolves from **Aron** starting at **Level 32** and evolves into **Aggron** starting at **Level 42**. This slow growth rate reflects the time required to build and harden its heavy iron armor.
