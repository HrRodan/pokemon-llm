## Identity & Lore
Mega Eelektross (Pokedex #10290) is the massive, empowered form of the EleFish Pokémon, a terrifying predator originally discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Reaching a length of 3 meters and weighing 180 kilograms, this blue, eel-like creature represents the pinnacle of its evolutionary line. According to its behavioral history, Eelektross is known to use its powerful, suckered arms to crawl out of the ocean depths to ambush prey on the shore, immediately dragging victims back into the water to be dispatched with high-voltage shocks. While Eelektross does not possess an official Mega Evolution in core series games, this specific form represents a significant surge in its predatory capabilities and electrical output.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 145, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 90, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker. With elite offensive stats in both categories, it can dismantle defensive cores regardless of whether they specialize in Physical or Special defense.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Electric-type**, it is technically **weak to Ground**. However, drawing from its biological heritage, it typically utilizes the **Levitate** ability to grant itself a complete immunity to Ground-type moves, effectively leaving it with no weaknesses. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its immense mixed attacking stats, key moves include **Wild Charge** (a high-recoil physical STAB), **Thunderbolt** (a reliable special STAB), **Drain Punch** (providing physical coverage and sustain), and **Flamethrower** (to incinerate Grass and Steel types that might resist its electricity).
* **Abilities:** **Levitate** (Provides full immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, capitalizing on its lack of a secondary type to create a Pokémon with zero natural weaknesses).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Eelektross is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Tynamo**, which is relatively weak and lacks a diverse movepool. Tynamo evolves into **Eelektrik** starting at **Level 39**. To reach its final form, Eelektrik must be **exposed to a Thunder Stone**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group, suggesting a fluid, versatile genetic structure. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential, and its eggs take approximately 20 cycles to hatch. Its physical shape is categorized as fish-like, though its ability to navigate terrestrial environments makes it one of the most versatile apex predators in the Pokémon world.
