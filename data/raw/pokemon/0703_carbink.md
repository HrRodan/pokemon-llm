## Identity & Lore
Carbink (Pokedex #703) is the Jewel Pokémon, a dual Rock and Fairy-type creature first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Formed under intense temperatures and pressures deep within the Earth's crust, Carbink is characterized by its grey, pebble-like body encrusted with brilliant blue crystals. It spends hundreds of years underground after birth, occasionally being dug up during cave excavations. While Carbink does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form itself, world lore and biological studies suggest a deep, mysterious connection to the Mythical Pokémon Diancie, which is said to be a sudden transformation or mutation of a Carbink. It is often found in deep caverns, where it can fire high-energy beams from the gemstones embedded in its head to fend off predators like Sableye, who hunt them for their jewels.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Defensive Wall / Entry Hazard Setter. With massive dual defensive stats of 150, Carbink functions as a premiere "Tank" despite its low HP pool.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Steel**, and is also weak to **Ground, Water, and Grass**. However, it boasts a valuable **Immunity to Dragon** and resists **Normal, Fire, Flying, Bug, and Dark-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** While its offensive stats are modest, Carbink excels when utilizing its massive Defense for damage or providing team utility.

## Evolution & Biology
Carbink is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species, maintaining its gem-studded form throughout its life. Despite its lack of evolution, it is biologically significant within the **Fairy** and **Mineral** egg groups. It has a slow growth rate and is known for its incredible longevity, often living for eons within the bedrock. While it is genderless, it can be bred with a Ditto. Its biological makeup is remarkably dense, weighing 5.7kg despite being only 0.3 meters tall, a testament to the high-pressure environment of its origin.
