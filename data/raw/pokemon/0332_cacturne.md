## Identity & Lore
Cacturne (Pokedex #332) is the Scarecrow Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Dark creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a humanoid cactus with a eerie, scarecrow-like silhouette, Cacturne is perfectly adapted to harsh desert environments. Its biology dictates a nocturnal lifestyle; during the day, it stands completely motionless to conserve moisture under the scorching sun, becoming active only when the temperature drops at night. Lore suggests that Cacturne packs trail travelers through the desert, waiting for them to succumb to exhaustion.
