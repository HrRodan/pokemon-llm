## Identity & Lore
Dipplin (Pokedex #1011) is the Candy Apple Pokémon, a unique dual-entity creature first discovered in the Kitakami region during Generation IX. Despite appearing as a single organism, Dipplin actually consists of two separate "wyrms" cohabitating within a shared apple coated in a thick, fragrant layer of golden syrup. One head emerges from the top while the tail of the second creature protrudes from the bottom, working in tandem to defend their sugary home. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Dipplin serves as a critical middle-stage evolution that eventually matures into the multi-headed Hydrapple. Its green coloration and sticky exterior allow it to blend into orchard environments, where it produces a scent so sweet it can overwhelm the senses of nearby Pokémon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 80, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 80, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Tank / Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**, and standard weaknesses to **Flying, Poison, Bug, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides excellent utility by resisting **Ground, Rock, and Water**, while providing a 4x double resistance to **Electric and Grass** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Special Attack and signature utility, its optimal moveset includes **Syrup Bomb** (a signature move that lowers the target's Speed for three turns), **Dragon Pulse** for consistent STAB damage, **Giga Drain** for sustained recovery, and **Recover** to capitalize on its high 110 Defense.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Supersweet Syrup:** Upon entering battle, Dipplin emits a scent that lowers the evasiveness of opposing Pokémon, making it an excellent partner in Double Battles.
    * **Gluttony:** Causes the Pokémon to consume its held Berry early (at 50% HP instead of 25%).
    * **Sticky Hold:** Prevents other Pokémon from stealing its held item, which is vital for maintaining Eviolite bulk or offensive items.

## Evolution & Biology
Dipplin is part of a three-stage evolutionary line with a branching path. It evolves from **Applin** when exposed to a **Syrupy Apple**, a specialty item found in the land of Kitakami. Unlike its counterparts Flapple and Appletun, Dipplin has the capacity to evolve further; it transforms into **Hydrapple** after being leveled up while knowing the move **Dragon Cheer**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Plant and Dragon** Egg Groups. Its slow growth rate and low base speed are compensated for by its remarkable physical durability and the tactical advantage provided by its syrupy secretions, which are used to entrap foes and reduce their mobility.
