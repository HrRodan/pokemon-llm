## Identity & Lore
Squawkabilly (Pokedex #931) is the Parrot Pokémon, a rowdy and territorial avian introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). Adorned with a distinct, pompadour-like crest, this Green Plumage variant is known for its preference for urban environments, where it thrives in bustling cities rather than deep forests. Squawkabilly are highly social but aggressive, forming large, organized flocks based specifically on the color of their feathers; these flocks are notorious for engaging in fierce, noisy territorial disputes over living space and food. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, it is unique for its four distinct plumage variations (Green, Blue, Yellow, and White), with the Green and Blue variants specifically having access to the Intimidate ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Squawkabilly is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. Despite its lack of evolution, it is biologically complex due to its color-coded social structures. This Pokémon belongs to the **Flying** egg group, and its eggs have a hatch counter of 15, indicating a relatively standard breeding cycle. In the wild of Paldea, its behavior is characterized by its "slow-then-very-fast" growth rate, reflecting a bird that matures its combat skills rapidly once it finds its place within a city flock.
