## Identity & Lore
Silcoon (Pokedex #266) is the Cocoon Pokémon first introduced in Generation III within the Hoenn region. This Bug-type creature is an intermediate stage of metamorphosis, characterized by its white, ball-shaped silk body. While it shares a pre-evolution with Cascoon, Silcoon is distinguished by its smoother silk application and white coloration. It inhabits forests where it tethers itself to tree branches using strong silk to prevent falling. Silcoon remains largely immobile to conserve energy for its upcoming evolution, drinking only rainwater collected on its silk and peering through a small hole to monitor its surroundings for predators.
