## Identity & Lore
Necrozma (Pokedex #800) is the Prism Pokémon, a powerful and enigmatic Legendary life-form originally discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. Reminiscent of the interdimensional Ultra Beasts, Necrozma is a black, crystalline entity that was found slumbering deep underground within Ten Carat Hill. In ancient times, it is said to have arrived from another world—specifically Ultra Megalopolis in Ultra Space—where it was once known as the "Light That Was Lost." Necrozma is driven by a predatory instinct to consume light to sustain its own energy, often appearing aggressive and pained. Beyond its base form, Necrozma possesses the unique ability to fuse with the legendary Pokémon Solgaleo and Lunala using the N-Solarizer and N-Lunarizer to become **Dusk Mane Necrozma** and **Dawn Wings Necrozma**, respectively. Furthermore, it can achieve a radiant, god-like state known as **Ultra Necrozma** through the process of Ultra Burst when holding the Ultranecrozium Z.

## Evolution & Biology
Necrozma is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve through traditional leveling. Instead, it undergoes **Forme Reversion** and **Fusion**. It can assimilate Solgaleo or Lunala to change its typing and base stats entirely. Biologically, its body is composed of a material similar to black glass, and its "face" is actually a collection of multicolored eyes that glow when it absorbs energy. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group and has a very slow growth rate, reflecting its status as an ancient, cosmic entity. Its hatch counter is exceptionally high at 120, though it cannot be obtained via breeding.
