## Identity & Lore
Delphox (Pokedex #655) is the Fox Pokémon, representing the final evolutionary stage of the Fire-type starter from the Kalos region (Generation VI). Standing at 1.5 meters, this bipedal Pokémon resembles a mystical mage or wizard, draped in a robe-like fur pattern of red and yellow. Delphox is renowned for its unique method of channeling its dual Fire and Psychic powers; it carries a branch that it ignites with its breath to use as a wand. By gazing into the flickering flame at the tip of this branch, Delphox enters a deep meditative state, allowing it to achieve intense focus and even peer into the future. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form, it remains one of the few Pokémon capable of learning the signature move Mystical Fire, which it uses to incinerate foes while weakening their spiritual (special) resolve.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 69, Defense 72, Sp. Atk 114, Sp. Def 100, Speed 104.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Special Utility.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Rock, Water, Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. Conversely, it possesses a high number of resistances, effectively withstanding **Fire, Grass, Ice, Fighting, Psychic, Steel, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Mystical Fire** (lowers opponent's Sp. Atk), **Psyshock** (targets physical defense using special power), **Shadow Ball** (for Ghost-type coverage), and **Focus Blast** (to check Dark and Rock-type threats). It can also utilize **Nasty Plot** to dramatically boost its offensive pressure.
* **Abilities:** **Blaze** increases the power of Fire-type moves by 50% when Delphox's health falls below one-third. Its Hidden Ability, **Magician**, allows it to steal the held item of any Pokémon it hits with a move, provided Delphox is not already holding an item.

## Evolution & Biology
Delphox is the culmination of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Fennekin**, which evolves into **Braixen** upon reaching Level 16. The final transformation occurs when Braixen reaches **Level 36**, at which point it gains its secondary Psychic typing and evolves into **Delphox**. Biologically, it is highly adapted to psychological warfare and pyrokinesis, shifting from the playful nature of a kit to the calculated demeanor of a seer. It belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group and is known for its relatively slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Breeding researchers note a hatch counter of 20, typical for starter species.
