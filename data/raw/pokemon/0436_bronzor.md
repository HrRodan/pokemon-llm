## Identity & Lore
Bronzor (Pokedex #436) is the dual-type Steel/Psychic "Bronze Pokémon" introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Resembling an ancient, green bronze mirror, this floating entity is steeped in archaeological mystery; implements shaped exactly like Bronzor have been discovered in ancient tombs, suggesting a deep connection to human history, though the nature of this relationship remains unknown. It possesses a patterned back that led ancient people to believe it held a mysterious power. Bronzor is genderless and typically found dwelling in caves, ruins, or mountainous areas like Mt. Coronet.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 57, Attack 24, Defense 86, Sp. Atk 24, Sp. Def 86, Speed 23.
*   **Archetype:** Defensive Wall / Trick Room Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Steel/Psychic type, it is naturally **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark** attacks. However, it boasts an **immunity to Poison** and **resists Normal, Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. Its defensive profile is heavily altered by its ability choice.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its low offensive stats, Bronzor relies on utility and its low speed. Key moves include **Stealth Rock** (hazard setting), **Gyro Ball** (deals damage based on how much slower the user is than the target), **Hypnosis** (induces sleep), and **Psychic** (STAB special damage). It is also a capable user of **Trick Room** to turn its low speed into an advantage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Levitate:** Grants full immunity to Ground-type attacks (Spikes, Earthquake), effectively removing one of its primary weaknesses.
    *   **Heatproof:** Halves the damage taken from Fire-type moves, turning a weakness into a neutral hit, and reduces burn damage.
    *   **Heavy Metal (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon's weight, which can increase the power of weight-based moves like Heavy Slam.

## Evolution & Biology
Bronzor is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Bronzong** starting at **Level 33**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group. In the wild, Bronzor may occasionally carry a **Metal Coat**. Its physiology is inorganic, and it sustains itself without eating, polishing its body to remain reflective.
