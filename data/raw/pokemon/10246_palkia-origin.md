## Identity & Lore
Palkia-Origin (Pokedex #10246) is the Origin Forme of the legendary Spatial Pokémon, representing the true appearance of the deity that governs the dimensions of space. While originally discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), this specific form was first chronicled in the ancient Hisui region. Standing at a massive 6.3 meters and weighing 659 kilograms, Palkia-Origin takes on a centaur-like, ethereal appearance that mirrors the majesty of the creator, Arceus. According to mythology, its very breath has the power to warp the foundations of space, and it is said to reside in a gap between parallel dimensions. As a member of the Creation Trio alongside Dialga and Giratina, Palkia-Origin represents the expansion and stability of the physical realm. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, this "Origin Forme" serves as a primal power-up achieved when Palkia is exposed to the Lustrous Globe.

## Evolution & Biology
Palkia-Origin is a singular Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to a traditional evolutionary line. It is a Forme change rather than an evolution; Palkia transitions into its Origin Forme when holding or exposed to the **Lustrous Globe** (or Lustrous Orb in certain contexts). Biologically, it is categorized in the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its purple coloration and draconic features, it is a genderless entity of myth. In its Origin Forme, its anatomy shifts to a more equine, upright stance, signifying its connection to the primordial forces that shaped the Sinnoh and Hisui regions. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience (306 Base EXP) to reach its full potential.
