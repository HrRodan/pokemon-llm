## Identity & Lore
Grimmsnarl (Pokedex #861) is the Bulk Up Pokémon, a formidable Dark and Fairy-type creature first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. Standing at 1.5 meters, this purple, humanoid Pokémon is shrouded in a dense, tangled mane of dark hair that functions as much more than simple fur; it acts like a complex network of muscle fibers. By wrapping these hairs around its limbs, Grimmsnarl can drastically enhance its physical power, allowing it to exert enough force to overwhelm even a Machamp. This hair is so integral to its biology that it serves as its primary means of both offense and defense. Beyond its standard form, Grimmsnarl is known to possess a powerful Gigantamax form, where its hair grows to monumental proportions, allowing it to ensnare opponents and even drill through the earth. It is often found in dark, secluded areas like the Glimwood Tangle, where its mischievous and menacing nature can go unchecked.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 120, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 75, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Utility Lead / Physical Attacker. While its Attack stat is high, Grimmsnarl is most famous in competitive play as a "Prankster Screen-Setter."
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison, Steel, and Fairy**. It boasts a unique defensive profile with **resistances to Ghost** and a complete **immunity to Dragon and Psychic** types.
* **Move Selection:** Grimmsnarl leverages its high Attack and signature utility to dominate the field. Key moves include **Spirit Break** (a signature physical Fairy move that lowers the target's Sp. Atk), **Play Rough** for high Fairy-type damage, **False Surrender** for a never-miss Dark-type STAB, and **Sucker Punch** for priority finishing. In utility roles, **Reflect**, **Light Screen**, and **Thunder Wave** are essential.
* **Abilities:** **Prankster** (the most viable competitive ability, giving priority to status moves like Reflect or Taunt), **Frisk** (allows the trainer to see the opponent's held item upon entering battle), and **Pickpocket** (steals an opponent's held item when hit by a contact move).

## Evolution & Biology
Grimmsnarl is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line, representing the full maturity of its mischievous beginnings. It evolves from **Morgrem** starting at **Level 42**, which itself evolves from the base form, **Impidimp**, starting at **Level 32**. Biologically, the line is unique for being an all-male species. Grimmsnarl belongs to the **Fairy and Humanshape** Egg Groups, and its growth rate is categorized as Medium. Its biology is centered on the manipulation of its own hair for physical enhancement, a trait that evolves from the smaller tufts seen on Impidimp to the full-body muscular enhancement seen in the adult form.
