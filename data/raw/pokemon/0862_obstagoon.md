## Identity & Lore
Obstagoon (Pokedex #862) is the Blocking Pokémon, a dual-type Dark and Normal creature introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). Standing 1.6 meters tall and weighing 46 kilograms, this bipedal powerhouse is the unique final evolution of the Galarian variant of the Zigzagoon line. Unlike its Hoennian counterparts, which do not evolve past Linoone, the Galarian Linoone developed this form due to the fierce competition and harsh conditions of the Galar region. Obstagoon is renowned for its staggering vocal volume and its signature "Obstruct" posture—a defensive stance where it crosses its arms to intimidate and destabilize opponents. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its punk-rock aesthetic and confrontational nature make it a cultural icon within the Galar region's battle stadiums.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 93, Attack 90, Defense 101, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 81, Speed 95.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Guts Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting** and is also weak to **Bug and Fairy**. However, it possesses two full immunities, being **Immune to Psychic and Ghost**, and it resists no other types specifically but benefits from its Normal-type neutralities.
* **Move Selection:** Obstagoon excels when using its physical prowess and signature utility. Key moves include **Obstruct** (to lower the opponent's Defense on contact), **Facade** (which doubles in power when paired with a status condition), **Close Combat** (for high-power coverage), and **Night Slash** (for a reliable Dark-type STAB with a high critical-hit ratio).
* **Abilities:** **Reckless** (increases the power of moves that have recoil damage), **Guts** (boosts the Attack stat by 50% if the Pokémon has a status condition, often triggered by a held Flame Orb), and the Hidden Ability **Defiant** (sharply raises Attack if any of its stats are lowered by an opponent, making it a perfect counter to Intimidate).

## Evolution & Biology
Obstagoon is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Galarian Zigzagoon**, which evolves into **Galarian Linoone** starting at Level 20. The final transformation into **Obstagoon** is unique; it occurs only when Galarian Linoone reaches **Level 35 or higher specifically during the night**. This nocturnal requirement reflects its predatory and confrontational nature. Biologically, Obstagoon belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group. Its survival strategy focuses on "blocking" and counterattacking, preferring to let the opponent strike first into its armored arms before unleashing a devastating, shouting-backed counter-assault.
