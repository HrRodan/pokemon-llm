## Identity & Lore
Whismur (Pokedex #293) is the Normal-type Whisper Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This pink, spherical creature is normally timid and resides in dark, secluded **caves** to avoid attention. True to its genus, Whismur usually speaks in a voice so quiet it is barely audible. However, its biology is a stark contrast of extremes; if it senses danger or becomes startled, it emits an earsplitting cry equal to the volume of a jet plane, often startling itself into crying even louder. It breathes through its ear canals, allowing it to cry continuously without pausing for breath.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 64, Attack 51, Defense 23, Sp. Atk 51, Sp. Def 23, Speed 28.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Attacker / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Despite its small stature and equal offensive stats, Whismur has an exceptionally deep special move pool. An optimal set includes **Hyper Voice** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), alongside **Flamethrower** and **Ice Beam** for high-tier coverage against Steel, Grass, Dragon, and Flying types. **Shadow Ball** provides coverage against Ghost-types that are immune to its Normal attacks.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Soundproof:** Makes the Pokémon immune to all sound-based moves (e.g., Roar, Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice).
    *   **Rattled (Hidden):** Increases the Pokémon's Speed by one stage when hit by a Bug, Ghost, or Dark-type move.

## Evolution & Biology
Whismur is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line characterized by sound manipulation. It evolves into **Loudred** upon reaching **Level 20**, which subsequently evolves into the massive **Exploud** starting at **Level 40**. In the wild, it can sometimes be found holding a **Chesto Berry**. Whismur belongs to the **Monster** and **Ground** (Field) Egg Groups.
