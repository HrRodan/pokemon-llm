## Identity & Lore
Leavanny (Pokedex #542) is the Nurturing Pokémon, a bipedal, insectoid creature originally discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Distinguished by its humanoid shape and vibrant green, leaf-like attire, it is renowned in the Pokémon world as a skilled tailor of the forest. Using the sharp cutters on its arms and sticky silk produced from its mouth, it weaves intricate clothing from leaves to keep small Pokémon warm, particularly its pre-evolved form, Sewaddle. While it primarily inhabits lush forests and canopy environments, its maternal instincts extend to other species, often providing shelter and warmth to those in need. Despite its elegant and nurturing appearance, its blade-like appendages are highly functional for both craftsmanship and defense. Currently, Leavanny has no known Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms, but it remains a staple of the Unovan ecosystem.

## Evolution & Biology
Leavanny is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Sewaddle**, which lives on the forest floor. Sewaddle evolves into the reclusive, leaf-wrapped **Swadloon** starting at Level 20. The final transformation into **Leavanny** is unique; it occurs only when Swadloon is leveled up with **High Friendship (220+ happiness)**, representing the bond and care it has developed for its trainer or environment. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a medium-slow growth rate. Its humanoid shape allows it to use moves like **Triple Axel** and **Helping Hand**, reflecting its versatile and supportive nature in both wild and competitive settings.
