## Identity & Lore
**Shroomish** (Pokedex #285) is the **Mushroom Pokémon** first discovered in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. This distinctively fungal creature inhabits the damp soil found in the dark depths of forests, where it typically remains motionless to blend in with fallen leaves. Biologically, Shroomish is a detritivore that sustains itself by feeding on compost composed of rotted vegetation. While it appears docile, it scatters toxic spores from the crown of its head when it senses danger. It is the base form of the formidable **Breloom**, a popular competitive Pokémon known for retaining Shroomish's signature status moves.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 40, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 60, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** **Disruptive Support Tank**. Due to access to the **Eviolite** item and the rare move Spore, it functions as a bulky status spreader in restricted formats (like Little Cup).
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Grass-type**, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its disruption capabilities rather than raw damage, its most viable moveset includes **Spore** (the only 100% accurate sleep move), **Leech Seed** for passive recovery, **Substitute** for safety, and **Giga Drain** or **Seed Bomb** for STAB damage and health regeneration.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Effect Spore:** Has a 30% chance of inducing paralysis, poison, or sleep on opponents that make physical contact.
    *   **Poison Heal:** A highly competitive ability that restores 1/8th of the Pokémon's maximum HP at the end of each turn if it is poisoned, turning a status condition into a buff.
    *   **Quick Feet (Hidden):** Boosts Speed by 50% if the Pokémon is inflicted with a status condition.

## Evolution & Biology
Shroomish is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Breloom** starting at **Level 23**. Notably, trainers often delay this evolution to allow Shroomish to learn the powerful move **Spore** early, as Breloom cannot learn it naturally. Shroomish belongs to the **Fairy** and **Plant** Egg Groups and possesses a Hatch Counter of 15. In the wild, it may be found holding a **Tiny Mushroom**, **Big Mushroom**, or **Kebia Berry**.
