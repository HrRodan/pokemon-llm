## Identity & Lore
Magneton (Pokedex #082) is the Magnet Pokémon, a fused entity formed by three Magnemite linked together by powerful magnetic forces. Introduced in Generation I (Kanto), this Electric/Steel-type features a gray, metallic body and is frequently observed hovering in rough terrain or industrial areas. Lore indicates that Magneton often appears when sunspots flare up, emitting high-voltage magnetic waves that can disrupt radio signals and raise the temperature by 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit within a 3,300-foot radius. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares a biological lineage with the ancient Paradox Pokémon, **Sandy Shocks**.

    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last in the turn.

## Evolution & Biology
Magneton is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Magnemite** starting at **Level 30**. It can further evolve into **Magnezone** through two distinct methods depending on the region: either by leveling up in a specific **special magnetic field** (such as Mt. Coronet, Chargestone Cave, or Vast Poni Canyon) or, in more recent generations, when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, though it is genderless and breeds with Ditto. Wild Magneton are occasionally found holding a **Metal Coat** or **Magnet**.
