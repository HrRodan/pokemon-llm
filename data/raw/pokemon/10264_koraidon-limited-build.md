## Identity & Lore
Koraidon (Limited Build) (Pokedex #10264) is a Fighting and Dragon-type Paradox Pokémon originating from the Paldea region in Generation IX. Identified in ancient texts as the "Winged King," this prehistoric ancestor of the modern-day Cyclizar is shrouded in mystery and primal power. According to an old expedition journal, Koraidon was said to have split the land with its bare fists, possessing strength that defies modern biological understanding. While this specific "Limited Build" reflects a restricted state of its true power, it remains a formidable legendary entity. As a Paradox Pokémon, it is a biological enigma that appears to have traveled through time via the Area Zero phenomenon. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its "Apex Build" represents its full potential, and it serves as the primal counterpart to the futuristic Miraidon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 135, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 100, Speed 135.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Wallbreaker. With a massive Speed tier of 135 and an equally impressive Attack stat, Koraidon is designed to outspeed most of the meta and deliver devastating physical blows.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Psychic, Dragon, and Ice**, and suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Rock, Bug, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Attack and the sun-boosting effects of its ability, Koraidon excels with moves such as **Collision Course** (its signature move which deals increased damage if super-effective), **Flare Blitz** (which gains a massive boost from the Sun), **Dragon Claw** for consistent STAB, and **Drain Punch** for offensive recovery and longevity.
* **Abilities:** **Orichalcum Pulse** (When the Pokémon enters a battle, it summons harsh sunlight. While the weather is sunny, Koraidon's Attack stat is increased by 33%). This ability makes Koraidon a premier Sun-setter and a terrifying physical threat simultaneously.

## Evolution & Biology
Koraidon is a standalone legendary Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species, belonging to a single-stage evolutionary line. It shares a distant biological link with the modern Pokémon Cyclizar, though Koraidon represents a far more aggressive and ancient lineage. As a legendary Paradox Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group and cannot be bred. Its biology is characterized by its vibrant red coloration and an upright, reptilian stance. Despite its "Limited Build" name, its base experience yield of 335 confirms its status among the most powerful entities in the Paldean ecosystem. It has a high hatch counter of 50 and a slow growth rate, typical of high-tier legendary species.
