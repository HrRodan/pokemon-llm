## Identity & Lore
Munkidori (#1015) is the Retainer Pokémon, a legendary Poison/Psychic-type introduced in Generation IX (Paldea) as part of the *The Teal Mask* expansion set in the land of Kitakami. Historically recognized as one of the "Loyal Three" alongside Okidogi and Fezandipiti, Munkidori is a humanoid, black-colored Pokémon whose existence is defined by the glowing purple chain wrapped around its head. According to Kitakami folklore, this chain is made of a specialized toxin that stimulated Munkidori’s brain, causing its immense psychic powers to bloom and granting it a level of cunning and intelligence far beyond its original nature. While it currently possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is a unique Legendary entity with deep ties to regional mythology and the paradoxical history of the "Ogre" Ogerpon.

## Evolution & Biology
Munkidori is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, its psychic capabilities are entirely extrinsic, derived from the toxic chain that serves as its source of power. It has a hatch counter of 50 and a slow growth rate, reflecting the difficulty of taming and training such a specialized and intelligent Legendary creature.
