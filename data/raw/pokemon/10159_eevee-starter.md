## Identity & Lore
Eevee-starter (Pokedex #10159) is the Evolution Pokémon, a special variant of the iconic species first discovered in the Kanto region of Generation I. This specific partner form is characterized by its slightly enhanced physical capabilities and access to an extraordinary array of elemental techniques not available to standard Eevee. Its genetic code is famously irregular, described as being in a state of constant flux that allows it to mutate and adapt when exposed to the radiation of elemental stones. While typically found in urban environments alongside humans, its brown, quadrupedal form is built for agility and survival. Beyond its standard forms, Eevee is known to possess a **Gigantamax form**, where it grows to massive proportions and gains the ability to use G-Max Cuddle, which infatuates opponents of the opposite gender.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 75, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 85, Speed 75.
* **Archetype:** Versatile Utility Attacker. With its balanced stat spread and access to specialized signature moves, it functions as a flexible "Jack-of-all-trades" that can provide team support while dealing consistent damage.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost** moves. It has no resistances.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical Attack and unique "Let's Go" movepool, key moves include **Double-Edge** (high-power STAB), **Sizzly Slide** (Fire-type damage with a guaranteed Burn), **Sappy Seed** (Grass-type damage that sets Leech Seed), and **Bouncy Bubble** (Water-type recovery).
* **Abilities:** **Run Away** (ensures escape from wild encounters), **Adaptability** (boosts the power of Normal-type moves from 1.5x to 2x, making its STAB attacks significantly more dangerous), and **Anticipation** (senses the opponent's dangerous moves upon entering battle).

## Evolution & Biology
