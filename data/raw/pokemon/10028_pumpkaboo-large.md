## Identity & Lore
Large Size Pumpkaboo (Pokedex #10028) is the Pumpkin Pokémon, a dual-type Ghost/Grass entity first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This specific variant represents the "Large" size, one of four distinct dimensional forms (Small, Average, Large, and Super) that this species can inhabit. Its biology is centered around a hollow, brown pumpkin-like lower body that is said to be possessed by a restless spirit trapped in the mortal plane. As the sun sets, these Pokémon become exceptionally active, wandering the shadows of forests and graveyards. While Pumpkaboo does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique size-based stat distribution allows it to serve different tactical niches than its smaller or larger counterparts. Its glowing yellow eyes and notched mouth give it the appearance of a carved jack-o'-lantern, designed to guide spirits to the afterworld or spirit them away.

* **Abilities:** **Pickup** (Allows the Pokémon to find held items outside of battle or retrieve used items), **Frisk** (Identifies the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing vital competitive intel), and the Hidden Ability **Insomnia** (Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep, making it a hard counter to Spore or Sleep Powder users).

## Evolution & Biology
Large Size Pumpkaboo is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the equally size-dependent **Gourgeist** when it is **traded between trainers**. The size of the Pumpkaboo is permanent and carries over to its evolution, directly influencing its HP, Attack, and Speed stats. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group. Biologically, the spirit inside the pumpkin is known to vary in size; legend suggests that larger Pumpkaboo are formed from the spirits of multiple wandering souls clustered together. Because of its Ghost typing, it can utilize exotic moves like **Trick-or-Treat**, which adds the Ghost type to its target, and **Destiny Bond**, which ensures that if it falls in battle, its opponent is taken down with it.
