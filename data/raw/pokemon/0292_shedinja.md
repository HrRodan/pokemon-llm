## Identity & Lore
Shedinja (Pokédex #292) is the Shed Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A unique entity among Bug and Ghost types, Shedinja is essentially the discarded exoskeleton of a Nincada that has been animated by a mysterious force. Residing primarily in forests, its brown, hollow body is completely immobile; it does not breathe or twitch. Local folklore warns that this Pokémon will steal the spirit of anyone who dares to peer into the hollow void on its back. It is a biological anomaly, possessing a fixed vitality that never increases regardless of its experience or level.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 1, Attack 90, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 30, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Wonder Guard Pivot / Gimmick Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** Due to its unique biology, Shedinja is effectively **immune to 13 distinct types**. However, it is instantly fatal if hit by its weaknesses: **Fire, Flying, Rock, Ghost, and Dark**. It is also highly vulnerable to passive damage sources such as Sandstorm, Hail, Toxic, and entry hazards like Spikes.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its respectable Attack stat and the need for utility, key moves include **Poltergeist** (high power STAB), **X-Scissor** (reliable Bug STAB), **Shadow Sneak** (priority to bypass low speed), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to cripple physical attackers).
*   **Abilities:** **Wonder Guard** (This defining ability renders the Pokémon immune to all direct damage moves unless they are super effective, making Shedinja invincible against many opponents lacking specific coverage).

## Evolution & Biology
Shedinja is part of a unique evolutionary event involving a 2-stage line. It is considered a special evolution of **Nincada**. When Nincada evolves into **Ninjask** starting at Level 20, Shedinja will spontaneously appear in the player's party, provided there is an **empty party slot** and an extra **Poké Ball** available in the inventory. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, unlike its pre-evolution which is in the Bug group.
