## Identity & Lore
Lickilicky (Pokedex #463) is the **Licking Pokémon**, a pure Normal-type entity introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Characterized by its rotund, pink physique and humanoid shape, this Pokémon is known for its incredible tongue dexterity. According to ecological research, Lickilicky wraps objects with its extensible tongue rather than using hands; however, getting too close to this Pokémon is hazardous, as it leaves everything it touches soaked in sticky drool containing numbness-inducing solvents. While it appears whimsical, its imposing bulk allows it to thrive in various environments.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 85, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 95, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** **Bulky Mixed Tank**. With excellent HP and solid defenses on both the physical and special spectrum, Lickilicky functions as a durable sponge that can dish out surprising damage using a vast movepool.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting-type** moves. It possesses a critical **immunity to Ghost-type** attacks. It does not naturally resist other types.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its slightly higher Attack stat and massive bulk, Lickilicky acts effectively with:
    *   **Body Slam:** Reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) with a high chance to paralyze faster opponents.
    *   **Knock Off:** Essential utility for removing opponent items while dealing damage.
    *   **Power Whip:** High-power coverage against Rock and Ground types that resist its Normal moves.
    *   **Explosion:** A signature "nuke" option; due to its high HP and STAB, Lickilicky possesses one of the most powerful self-destruct moves in the pokedex.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused and blocks the Intimidate stat drop (in later generations).
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from being infatuated or falling victim to the move Taunt, making it excellent for setting up support moves.
    *   **Cloud Nine (Hidden):** Suppresses all weather effects while on the field, functioning as a hard counter to Rain or Sun teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Lickilicky is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Lickitung** specifically when leveled up while knowing the move **Rollout**. If Lickitung forgets this move, it cannot evolve until it relearns it. It belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group and possesses a base happiness of 70. Wild Lickilicky are occasionally found holding a **Lagging Tail**, reflecting their naturally slow movement speed.
