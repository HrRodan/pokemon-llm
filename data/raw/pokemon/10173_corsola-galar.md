## Identity & Lore
Galarian Corsola (Pokedex #10173) is the bleached, Ghost-type variant of the Coral Pokémon, first discovered in the Galar region. While the Johto variant is a vibrant Water/Rock-type, Galarian Corsola is the tragic result of sudden climate change and ocean temperature shifts that occurred in ancient times, causing the coral to perish and linger as a spectral entity. Its body is a pale, stony grey, and the semi-transparent branches on its head are actually spiritual manifestations that can sap the life force of those who touch them. Despite its grim origin, its form is considered hauntingly beautiful, and its shed branches are sometimes treated as treasures. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique evolutionary path into Cursola distinguishes it from its Johto ancestors.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 55, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 100, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Eviolite Tank / Defensive Pivot. Because it is not a fully evolved Pokémon, Galarian Corsola is a premier user of the **Eviolite** item, which boosts its already impressive 100-base defenses to levels that can wall even legendary threats.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost and Dark**. It **resists Bug and Poison**, and possesses a total **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Galarian Corsola relies on utility and attrition rather than raw power. Key moves include **Strength Sap** (its signature healing move that lowers the target's Attack), **Night Shade** (to deal consistent fixed damage), **Will-O-Wisp** (to burn physical attackers), and **Stealth Rock** (for entry hazard support).
* **Abilities:** **Weak Armor** causes its Defense to lower but its Speed to rise when hit by physical attacks (rarely used on defensive sets). Its Hidden Ability, **Cursed Body**, is highly valuable, providing a 30% chance to disable any move that deals damage to it, often shutting down an opponent's only way to break through its defenses.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Corsola is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line, representing a departure from the Johto variant which does not evolve. It evolves into **Cursola** starting at **Level 38**. Biologically, it is a sedentary creature that thrives in the spectral energy of the Galar region's waters. It belongs to the **Water 1 and Water 3** Egg Groups, and despite its ghostly nature, it retains its biological classification as a coral organism. Its growth rate is categorized as Fast, and it typically requires a Hatch Counter of 20 to emerge from an egg. Unlike the pink Johto Corsola, this variant’s survival strategy is rooted in durability and debilitating its foes with spiritual energy rather than hard mineral armor.
