## Identity & Lore
Absol (Pokedex #359) is the Disaster Pokémon, a pure Dark-type entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This quadrupedal, mammalian Pokémon is covered in white fur with a dark blue face and a distinct scythe-like horn on its head. It inhabits rugged mountainous environments and possesses the ability to sense subtle changes in the sky and earth, allowing it to predict natural catastrophes such as earthquakes and tidal waves. Because Absol often appears before these tragedies to warn people, it was historically misunderstood and persecuted as the cause of the disasters. While normally a single-stage Pokémon, it is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Absol, gaining angel-like wings and a significant boost to its combat capabilities.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 130, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 60, Speed 75.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dark-type, Absol is **weak to Fighting, Bug, and Fairy** moves. It possesses a standard resistance to **Ghost and Dark** types and is completely **immune to Psychic** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Attack stat and "Super Luck" capability, an optimal move set includes **Sucker Punch** (to compensate for average speed with priority), **Night Slash** (high critical hit ratio), **Play Rough** (for coverage against Fighting/Dark types), and **Swords Dance** (to sharply raise its Attack). **Knock Off** and **Psycho Cut** are also viable options found in its move pool.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces the opposing Pokémon to use 2 PP for every move targeting Absol, useful for stalling out low-PP moves.
    *   **Super Luck:** Increases the critical-hit ratio of its moves, synergizing perfectly with moves like Night Slash and Psycho Cut.
    *   **Justified (Hidden):** Raises Absol's Attack stat by one stage when hit by a Dark-type move, allowing it to punish predicted Dark attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Absol is a standalone Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon (excluding its temporary Mega Evolution). It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. Absol has a base happiness of 35, which is significantly lower than the standard 70, reflecting its solitary and misunderstood nature.
