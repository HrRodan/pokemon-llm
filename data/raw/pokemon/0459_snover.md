## Identity & Lore
Snover (Pokedex #459) is known as the Frost Tree Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Ice creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Resembling a small, white, snow-covered fir tree, Snover is indigenous to high-altitude, snowy mountains. Despite its isolation in these harsh climates, it is described as boldly inquisitive toward humans rather than fearful. In the wild, it grows berries around its midsection that have the texture of frozen treats, often attracting other Pokémon. While Snover itself does not possess alternative forms, it evolves into Abomasnow, which is capable of Mega Evolution in generations where that phenomenon is present.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 62, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 62, Sp. Def 60, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Weather Setter / Trick Room Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Grass/Ice type, Snover has a defensively fragile typing. It suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire** moves. It is also weak to Fighting, Flying, Poison, Rock, Bug, and Steel types. However, it resists Water, Grass, Electric, and Ground moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its perfectly balanced offensive stats and low speed, key moves include **Blizzard** (which gains perfect accuracy in Snow), **Wood Hammer** for heavy physical damage, **Ice Shard** for priority to bypass its low speed, and **Giga Drain** for sustainability.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Snow Warning:** The Pokémon summons a snowstorm (or hailstorm in earlier generations) when it enters a battle. This is its primary competitive niche, setting weather automatically.
    *   **Soundproof (Hidden):** Gives full immunity to all sound-based moves (e.g., Bug Buzz, Hyper Voice, Roar).

## Evolution & Biology
Snover is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Abomasnow** starting at **Level 40**. Uniquely, Snover belongs to both the **Monster** and **Plant** Egg Groups, allowing it to bridge breeding chains between plant-like organisms and more beast-like Pokémon. Wild Snover are occasionally found holding a **Never-Melt Ice**, reflecting their affinity for freezing temperatures.
