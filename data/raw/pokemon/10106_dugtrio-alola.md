## Identity & Lore
Alolan Dugtrio (Pokedex #10106) is the Alolan Form of the Mole Pokémon, a Ground and Steel-type variant first discovered in the Alola region (Generation VII). Unlike its Kanto counterpart, Alolan Dugtrio is characterized by its magnificent, golden hair-like structures, which are actually thin, flexible whiskers made of high-quality steel. These whiskers serve as sophisticated sensors, allowing the Pokémon to detect vibrations from miles away while burrowing 60 miles beneath the surface. In Alolan culture, these Pokémon are revered as feminine deities of the earth, and it is considered bad luck to remove any of their fallen whiskers. While Dugtrio does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its Alolan variant is a distinct biological adaptation to the volcanic soil found in the tropical archipelago.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Dugtrio is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from Alolan Diglett starting at **Level 26**. This Pokémon is often found in cave environments and mountainous regions where volcanic activity has enriched the soil with minerals, facilitating the growth of its metallic whiskers. Biologically, it is composed of three heads that think in perfect unison to coordinate complex tunneling maneuvers. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders looking to optimize for competitive play.
