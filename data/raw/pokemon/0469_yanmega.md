## Identity & Lore
Yanmega (Pokedex #469) is the imposing Ogre Darner Pokémon, first discovered in the **Sinnoh** region (Generation IV). Visually striking with its deep green coloration and massive wingspan, Yanmega is an apex aerial predator inspired by prehistoric dragonflies like the *Meganeura*. Its biology allows it to fly comfortably while carrying an adult human, though its primary method of combat involves churning its wings to generate ultrasonic shock waves capable of inflicting critical internal injuries on foes. It is known for its incredible jaw strength and agility, biting apart prey while flying at high speeds. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its ancient origins are reflected in its evolution method.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 86, Attack 76, Defense 86, Sp. Atk 116, Sp. Def 56, Speed 95.
*   **Archetype:** Special Sweeper / Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a **Bug/Flying** type, it suffers a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**. It is also weak to Fire, Flying, Electric, and Ice. However, it boasts a **Double Resistance (4x) to Grass and Fighting**, a standard resistance to Bug, and an **Immunity to Ground**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its dominant Special Attack, key moves include **Bug Buzz** (high power STAB), **Air Slash** (STAB with flinch chance), **Ancient Power** (Rock-type coverage), and **Protect** (crucial for ensuring a safe Speed Boost activation).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Speed Boost:** Its Speed stat is raised by one stage at the end of each turn, allowing it to snowball out of control quickly.
    *   **Tinted Lens:** Doubles the power of "not very effective" moves, allowing Yanmega to function as a wallbreaker by ignoring type resistances.
    *   **Frisk (Hidden):** The Pokémon can check the foe's held item upon entering battle.

## Evolution & Biology
Yanmega is the final form of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Yanma** specifically when leveled up while knowing the move **Ancient Power**. This unique condition reflects the awakening of its prehistoric genes. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches relatively quickly compared to other species.
