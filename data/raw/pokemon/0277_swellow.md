## Identity & Lore
Swellow (Pokedex #277) is the Swallow Pokémon, a dual-type Normal/Flying bird native to the **Hoenn** region (Generation III). Distinguished by its glossy dark blue wings, red breast, and split tail, Swellow is renowned for its graceful aerial maneuvering. It inhabits grasslands where it flies high overhead, diving at steep angles to snatch prey with its talons. As a creature deeply connected to the skies of Hoenn, it meticulously grooms its glossy wings; if two Swellows gather, they will diligently clean each other's plumage. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is recognized for its incredible speed and determination in battle.
