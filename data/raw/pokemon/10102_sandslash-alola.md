## Identity & Lore
Alolan Sandslash (Pokedex #10102) is the Alolan Form of the Mouse Pokémon, representing a radical biological adaptation to the frigid, snow-capped peaks of the Alola region. Unlike its Kantonian cousin that thrives in arid deserts, this variant is an Ice/Steel type that migrated to snowy mountains to escape volcanic activity. Its skin and quills are coated in a layer of ice so hard it is compared to steel; these massive, curved icicles provide formidable defense and are used to carve paths through deep snow. While it retains the behavior of curling into a spiny ball to defend itself or roll at high speeds, its increased weight from the icy armor makes it slower than the original form unless environmental conditions are in its favor. Despite its primary association with the Alola region (Generation VII), it is classified under the legacy of the original Generation I (Kanto) species. While Alolan Sandslash does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its unique typing makes it a distinct specimen in the study of regional divergence.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 100, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 65, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Weather Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting and Fire**, and a standard weakness to **Ground**. However, it boasts a massive list of resistances, including **Normal, Flying, Bug, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy**, and is **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high physical Attack and Steel/Ice STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), optimal moves include **Icicle Crash** (for high flinch chance), **Iron Head** (reliable Steel damage), **Earthquake** (to cover Fire and Steel-type opponents), and **Swords Dance** (to boost its sweeping potential).
* **Abilities:** **Snow Cloak** (increases evasion during snow/hail) and its Hidden Ability, **Slush Rush**, which doubles its Speed stat in snowy weather, transforming it from a slow tank into a terrifying late-game cleaner.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Sandslash is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Alolan Sandshrew** specifically when exposed to the radiation of an **Ice Stone**, a departure from the level-based evolution of its desert-dwelling counterpart. Biologically, it is part of the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group. Its claws have evolved to be larger and more hooked to facilitate climbing icy cliffs, and it is known to frequently carry a **Graw Claw** which it uses to relentlessly grip its prey or opponents. Despite its harsh exterior, it maintains a medium growth rate and a base happiness of 70, making it a loyal albeit prickly companion for trainers capable of navigating the high-altitude environments it calls home.
