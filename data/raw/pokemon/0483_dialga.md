## Identity & Lore
Dialga (Pokedex #483) is the Legendary Temporal Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned as a member of the Creation Trio, it is said that time began moving when Dialga was born and flows purely based on the beating of its heart. This massive quadruped is clad in metallic armor and possesses the unique ability to control time, allowing it to travel between past and future. While it appears in Sinnoh myths as an ancient deity, modern trainers may also encounter its altered state, **Origin Forme Dialga**, which it assumes when utilizing the Adamant Crystal.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 120, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 150, Sp. Def 100, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Attacker / Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** Benefiting from the phenomenal defensive synergy of the **Steel/Dragon** typing, Dialga possesses only two weaknesses: **Fighting** and **Ground**. Conversely, it boasts a massive list of resistances, including Normal, Water, Electric, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, and Steel, along with a complete immunity to **Poison**. Notably, its Steel typing neutralizes the standard Dragon-type weaknesses to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Special Attack (150), a competitive moveset includes its signature move **Roar of Time** (a devastating Dragon-type nuke), **Flash Cannon** (for consistent Steel-type STAB), **Draco Meteor** for immediate high damage, and **Earth Power** or **Fire Blast** to provide coverage against opposing Steel types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces the opposing Pokémon to consume 2 PP for every move used, allowing Dialga to stall out low-PP moves like Hydro Pump or Close Combat.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden):** Protects Dialga from damaging moves used by its allies in Double Battles, such as Earthquake or Surf.

## Evolution & Biology
Dialga is a Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It is a single-stage entity typically encountered at the Spear Pillar or similarly ancient locations. As a Legendary creature, it belongs to the **No-Eggs** group and cannot be bred. In the lore of the Hisui region, its appearance changes significantly into its Origin Forme, resembling the creator Pokémon, Arceus, more closely.
