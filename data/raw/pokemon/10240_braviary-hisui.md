## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Braviary (Pokedex #10240) is the Valiant Pokémon, a majestic and formidable regional variant discovered in the ancient Hisui region (the land that would become modern-day Sinnoh). Unlike its Unovan counterpart, Hisuian Braviary is a Psychic/Flying type, characterized by its larger size and the eerie, glowing purple flames that emanate from its crest. These flames are fueled by psychic energy, which the Pokémon uses to generate powerful shockwaves capable of stunning prey. Legends from the Hisui era describe it as a solitary hunter that arrives from the north in the winter. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is recognized as one of the Noble Pokémon's kin or a rideable Pokémon in its home region, serving as a vital means of aerial transportation.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 83, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 112, Sp. Def 70, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker. With a massive base HP and a high Special Attack, Hisuian Braviary excels at taking a hit and reciprocating with devastating mental and elemental force.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, Ice, Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It notably **resists Grass and Psychic**, and possesses a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Fighting**. It is also **immune to Ground-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack and signature capabilities, key moves include **Esper Wing** (a signature move that raises its Speed), **Psychic** or **Psyshock** for heavy STAB damage, **Hurricane** for high-power aerial assaults, and **Heat Wave** or **Shadow Ball** for essential type coverage.
* **Abilities:** **Keen Eye** prevents other Pokémon from lowering its accuracy and ignores evasion boosts. **Sheer Force** increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30% but removes those effects, providing massive damage potential. Its Hidden Ability, **Tinted Lens**, is highly prized as it doubles the damage of moves that are "not very effective," allowing it to brute-force through resistant opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Braviary is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rufflet** starting at **Level 54**, specifically when the evolution occurs within the environmental conditions of the **Hisui region**. While Rufflet itself does not have a regional form, the energy of the ancient north influences its development into this Psychic-type raptor rather than the standard Normal/Flying-type Braviary found in Unova. Biologically, it is a member of the **Flying egg group**. It is known for its immense physical strength, capable of carrying heavy loads across vast distances, and its protective nature, often putting itself in harm's way to defend its allies.
