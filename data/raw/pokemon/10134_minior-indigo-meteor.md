## Identity & Lore
Minior-Indigo-Meteor (Pokedex #10134) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique celestial organism originally discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This specific variant represents the Indigo Core encased in its dense, stony outer shell. Minior lives high within the stratosphere, spending its life consuming dust and metallic particles from the ozone layer. When its shell becomes too heavy from accumulated debris, it loses buoyancy and hurtles toward the planet's surface like a falling star. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its biology is defined by its dramatic transformation capability—once its protective "brown" rocky exterior is breached, it reveals a vibrant, glowing core.

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve into or from any other species; however, it exists in two distinct states: the Meteor Form and the Core Form. This specific Indigo variant is one of seven possible colors it can manifest. It belongs to the Mineral egg group and has a hatch counter of 25, reflecting its crystalline and inorganic composition. Despite its rocky appearance, it is a living entity that thrives on atmospheric nutrients and can use moves like Self-Destruct or Explosion as a last resort when its shell is compromised upon impact with the ground.
