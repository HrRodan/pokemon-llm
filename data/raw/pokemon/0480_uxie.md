## Identity & Lore
Uxie (Pokedex #480) is the Legendary **Knowledge Pokémon**, a crucial figure in the mythology of **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. As one of the three Lake Guardians, specifically residing in Lake Acuity, Uxie is revered as "The Being of Knowledge" and is credited in myths with bestowing wisdom upon humanity to enrich their lives. This small, yellow, fairy-like creature is distinct for always keeping its eyes closed. According to Sinnoh folklore, its power is so immense that if anyone were to gaze into its open eyes, their memory would be instantly and permanently wiped out. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is a member of a trio alongside Mesprit and Azelf.

## Evolution & Biology
Uxie is a **Basic Pokémon** and does not evolve into or from any other species, as is standard for most Legendary Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it cannot breed. In the context of the Sinnoh region's lore, Uxie is spiritually connected to the other Lake Guardians, Mesprit (Emotion) and Azelf (Willpower), forming the trio responsible for maintaining the balance of the world against Dialga and Palkia.
