## Identity & Lore
Banette (Pokedex #354) is the Marionette Pokémon, first introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A Ghost-type creature born from strong grudges, Banette was originally a pitiful plush doll that was thrown away by its owner. Now animated by hatred, it wanders urban areas in search of the child who abandoned it. To generate the energy required to lay strong curses, it sticks pins into its own body. Though typically found in its standard form, Banette is capable of transcending its limits via **Mega Evolution** into Mega Banette, unleashing even greater vindictive power.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 64, Attack 115, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 83, Sp. Def 63, Speed 65.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Attacker / Disruptor.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ghost-type, Banette is **weak to Ghost and Dark** moves. It possesses valuable immunities to **Normal and Fighting** types, and resists **Poison and Bug** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** capitalizing on its impressive Attack stat (115), Banette utilizes powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and utility moves such as **Poltergeist** (massive physical damage), **Shadow Sneak** (priority execution), **Knock Off** (item removal and coverage), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to burn opponents and mitigate its low physical bulk).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Insomnia:** Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep.
    *   **Frisk:** Allows the Pokémon to identify the opponent's held item upon entering battle.
    *   **Cursed Body (Hidden):** May disable a move used on the Pokémon if it makes contact.

## Evolution & Biology
Banette is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Shuppet** starting at **Level 37**. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group. While it usually inhabits urban environments near people, it is driven purely by the memory of its past life as a discarded toy.
