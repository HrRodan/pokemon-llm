## Identity & Lore
Mega Scolipede (#10288) is the Megapede Pokémon, a massive and imposing Bug/Poison-type creature that represents the pinnacle of its evolutionary line. Originating from the Unova region (Generation V), this form is characterized by its heavy, "armor-shaped" exoskeleton and a vibrant red coloration that signals its high toxicity. While the standard Scolipede is known for its blistering speed and predatory efficiency, this Mega Evolution appears to trade some of its velocity for overwhelming physical power and nearly impenetrable defenses. It is a relentless hunter that uses its quick, rhythmic movements to corner prey, attacking without mercy using the sharp, poisonous horns located on its head and rear. Though Scolipede does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form in recorded Kanto or Paldean history, this Mega Evolution serves as its ultimate combat state.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 140, Defense 149, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 99, Speed 62.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Tank / Wallbreaker. With a massive Base Defense of 149 and an Attack stat of 140, it functions as a frontline juggernaut capable of absorbing physical blows while dealing devastating return damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Flying, Rock, Ground, and Psychic**. Conversely, it highly **resists Grass and Fighting (Double Resistance 0.25x)**, and provides standard resistance against Poison, Bug, and Fairy types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite physical power, key moves for Mega Scolipede include **Megahorn** (its strongest Bug-type STAB), **Poison Jab** (to punish Fairy and Grass types), **Earthquake** (for vital coverage against Rock and Fire types), and **Swords Dance** (to further boost its already lethal Attack).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Scolipede is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Venipede**, which evolves into the cocoon-like **Whirlipede** starting at Level 22. Whirlipede then evolves into the massive **Scolipede** at Level 30. This Mega Evolution is triggered when Scolipede is exposed to its specific Mega Stone in battle. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a medium-slow growth rate. Its heavy weight of 230.5 kg and its armor-like shape suggest it is designed for crashing through dense forest undergrowth and intimidating rivals through sheer physical presence.
