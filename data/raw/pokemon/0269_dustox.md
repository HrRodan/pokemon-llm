## Identity & Lore
Dustox (Pokédex #269) is the Poison Moth Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Poison creature introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Nocturnal by nature, this Pokémon is instinctively drawn to light, often forming swarms around the bright lights of cities where they wreak havoc by stripping the leaves off roadside trees for food. When agitated, Dustox scatters a toxic dust from its wings that is potent enough to cause paralysis on contact. It is the final evolutionary stage of the Wurmple line, representing the divergent path from its counterpart, Beautifly. Its wings feature eye-like patterns used to startle predators in its forest habitat.

## Evolution & Biology
Dustox is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cascoon** starting at **Level 10**. This lineage begins with **Wurmple**, which evolves into Cascoon starting at **Level 7** (determined by the Pokémon's internal personality value, distinguishing it from the Silcoon/Beautifly branch). Dustox belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 15 egg cycles.
