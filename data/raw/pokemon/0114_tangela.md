## Identity & Lore
Tangela (Pokedex #114) is the Vine Pokémon, a pure Grass-type entity originating from Generation I (Kanto). This cryptic creature is instantly recognizing by the mass of blue, seaweed-like vines that swath its entire body, effectively obscuring its true appearance. Biological studies suggest these vines never stop growing, and if lost, they are quickly replaced. Tangela is typically found in grasslands or the edges of forests where its vines constantly shake as it moves, unnerving potential predators. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biology is unique due to the mystery surrounding what lies beneath its vegetative exterior.
