## Identity & Lore
Mega Chimecho (Pokedex #10306) is the Mega Evolved form of the Wind Chime Pokémon, a serene yet powerful entity originally discovered in the grasslands of the Hoenn region (Generation III). While its base form is known for hanging from trees and eaves using the suction cup on its head, this Mega Evolution enhances its hollow body to amplify acoustic energy. Its cries, which normally sound like a soothing chime, are transformed into devastating ultrasonic waves when it becomes enraged, capable of knocking foes flying through sheer vibrational force. As a Psychic/Steel-type variant, Mega Chimecho transitions from a fragile support Pokémon into a sturdy, metallic resonant bell, possessing a mystical presence that echoes across the fields of Hoenn.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 50, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 120, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper. Mega Chimecho trades mobility for massive defensive investment and a blistering Special Attack stat, making it a formidable "Tank" that can retaliate with high-magnitude special moves.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Fire, Ghost, and Dark**. Thanks to its Steel typing, it possesses a massive array of resistances, including **Normal, Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite 135 Special Attack and Psychic/Steel typing, key moves include **Psychic** (high-precision STAB), **Flash Cannon** (Steel-type STAB that may lower Sp. Def), **Shadow Ball** (for coverage against Ghost-types), and **Dazzling Gleam** (to punish Dark-type switch-ins).
* **Abilities:** While the Mega Form's specific ability is localized to its transformation, it traditionally retains or enhances **Levitate**, which would grant it a crucial immunity to Ground-type attacks, effectively removing one of its primary weaknesses.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Chimecho represents the temporary peak of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Chingling**, a baby Pokémon that evolves into **Chimecho** when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+) during the Night**. Chimecho can then achieve this **Mega Evolution** through the use of a specific Mega Stone during battle. Biologically, it belongs to the **Indeterminate** egg group and is known for its "Fast" growth rate. Its physical structure, categorized by its arm-like appendages and light weight (8.0kg), allows it to float effortlessly on the wind, even as its new Steel-type properties harden its outer shell into a resonant chime.
