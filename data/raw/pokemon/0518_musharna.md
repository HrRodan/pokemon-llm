## Identity & Lore
Musharna (Pokedex #518) is the Drowsing Pokémon, a distinctive Psychic-type creature introduced in Generation V (Unova). Resembling a curled, pink tapir or embryo, Musharna is perpetually asleep, surrounded by a faint, billowing mist known as Dream Mist that emanates from its forehead. This mist is semantically dense with the subconscious data of people and Pokémon; it is said that the smoke changes color depending on the nature of the dreams it has consumed, turning deep and dark when fueled by nightmares. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Musharna served as the lore-centric mascot for the Pokémon Dream World mechanic during its debut region. Its design is heavily inspired by the *kasha* or *baku*, mythical Japanese spirits that devour dreams.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 116, Attack 55, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 107, Sp. Def 95, Speed 29.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Trick Room Setter / Tanky Special Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** types.
* **Move Selection:** Musharna excels as a slow, methodical attacker that thrives under the effects of **Trick Room**, which reverses move priority to favor its abysmal base 29 Speed. For offense, it utilizes **Psychic** or **Psyshock** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage. It has incredible synergy with **Stored Power** when paired with **Calm Mind** to boost its Special Attack and Special Defense simultaneously. For coverage against Dark and Dragon types, **Moonblast** or **Dazzling Gleam** are optimal choices.
* **Abilities:** **Forewarn** (Alerts the Pokémon to the opponent's move with the highest base power); **Synchronize** (Passes on status conditions like Burn, Paralysis, or Poison to the attacker); **Telepathy** (Hidden Ability: Prevents damage from teammates' moves in Double Battles, such as Earthquake or Surf).

## Evolution & Biology
Musharna is part of a two-stage evolutionary line and represents the final form of the family. It evolves from **Munna** when exposed to a **Moon Stone**. Biologically, Musharna is highly stationary, spending its life in a trance-like state to process the Dream Mist it generates. This mist is often harvested by researchers (notably Fennel in the Unova region) for its reality-warping properties. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and has a fast growth rate, meaning it reaches its maximum level quickly compared to other Psychic types. Its high base HP of 116 makes it one of the naturally sturdiest Psychic-types in its tier, often used to support its team via **Heal Bell** or **Helping Hand**.
