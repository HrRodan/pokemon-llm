## Identity & Lore
Froakie (Pokedex #656) is the Bubble Frog Pokémon, a nimble Water-type starter originally discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This small, blue quadruped is distinguished by the delicate yet flexible "Frubbles"—thick foam secreted from its chest and back—which reduce the impact of physical blows and serve as a protective buffer. While seemingly lighthearted, Froakie is incredibly observant, carefully watching its surroundings while appearing to daydream. While Froakie itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the progenitor of the Greninja line, which famously achieved the unique "Ash-Greninja" Battle Bond transformation, a phenomenon closely tied to the deep bond between Pokémon and Trainer.

## Combat Profile

* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Special Attack and Speed, Froakie excels with high-powered and tactical moves such as **Hydro Pump**, **Ice Beam** for coverage against Grass types, **Scald** to threaten burns, and **U-turn** to maintain field momentum.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Torrent:** Increases the power of Water-type moves by 50% when Froakie's health falls below one-third of its maximum.
    * **Protean (Hidden Ability):** A top-tier competitive ability that changes Froakie’s type to match the move it is about to use, ensuring every attack gains a Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) and allowing for complex defensive mind games.

## Evolution & Biology
Froakie is the first member of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the swifter **Frogadier** starting at **Level 16**, which further matures into the master of stealth, **Greninja**, upon reaching **Level 36**. Biologically, Froakie belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and has a Hatch Counter of 20, making it a relatively common project for breeders seeking the elusive Protean ability. Despite its fragile appearance, its speed and ability to scale walls with its adhesive Frubbles make it a versatile inhabitant of both freshwater ponds and urban environments.
