## Identity & Lore
Iron Jugulis (Pokedex #993) is a Paradox Pokémon classified as the Paradox Pokémon. It is a dual-type Dark/Flying mechanical entity first discovered in the Paldea region during the events of Generation IX (Pokémon Violet). This futuristic being bears a striking resemblance to Hydreigon, and according to paranormal magazines like Occulture, it is rumored to be the result of a Hydreigon's lineage intermingling with robotic technology in the distant future. Its blue, cybernetic body and three-headed digital display screens differentiate it from its biological counterpart. As a Paradox Pokémon found deep within the Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero), it lacks the traditional Hydreigon abilities like Levitate, instead utilizing advanced energy-driven propulsion. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is considered a futuristic counterpart to the ancient Paradox Pokémon found in Pokémon Scarlet.

## Evolution & Biology
Iron Jugulis is a single-stage Paradox Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species; it exists as a standalone biological anomaly from a potential future timeline. Unlike the Deino line, which requires a high level to reach its final form, Iron Jugulis is found fully manifested within Area Zero. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is described as a "metallic object" that mimics the behavior of a ruthless predator, though its internal workings remain a mystery to modern Paldean science.
