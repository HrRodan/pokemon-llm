## Identity & Lore
Sableye (Pokedex #302) is the Darkness Pokémon, a dual-type Dark/Ghost creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This purple, humanoid entity leads a quiet life deep within caverns and caves. While folklore suggests it steals human spirits when its gemstone eyes glow with a sinister light, it is biologically driven by a diet of raw gems and rocks, which crystallize to form the jewels on its body. Sableye shares a predatory relationship with the Pokémon Carbink, often hunting them for their jewels. Though small, Sableye possesses the capability to undergo **Mega Evolution** into Mega Sableye, where it shelters behind a massive, defensive gemstone.
