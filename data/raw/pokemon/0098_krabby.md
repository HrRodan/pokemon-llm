## Identity & Lore
Krabby (Pokedex #098) is the River Crab Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Kanto** region (Generation I). Defined by its vibrant red coloration and armor-like carapace, this Pokémon inhabits the **water's edge**, commonly found on beaches and riverbanks. According to research, its massive pincers serve a dual purpose: they are powerful weapons used for combat and essential counterweights that allow Krabby to maintain balance while walking sideways. While Krabby itself does not possess alternate forms, its evolution, Kingler, is capable of achieving a **Gigantamax** form in the Galar region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 105, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 25, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Physical Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water** type, Krabby is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its exceptional Attack stat (105), which rivals many fully evolved Pokémon, Krabby functions best with physical attacks. Key moves include:
    *   **Crabhammer:** A high-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move with a heightened critical hit ratio.
    *   **Liquidation:** A reliable physical Water attack that may lower the target's Defense.
    *   **Knock Off:** Provides critical utility by removing the opponent's held item while dealing damage.
    *   **Swords Dance:** sharply boosts its already impressive Attack stat to dangerous levels.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Hyper Cutter:** Prevents the Pokémon's Attack stat from being lowered by opponent abilities or moves (e.g., Intimidate).
    *   **Shell Armor:** Protects the Pokémon from receiving Critical Hits.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden Ability):** Removes additional effects from attacking moves (like Liquidation's defense drop chance) to increase the move's power by 30%.

## Evolution & Biology
Krabby is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Kingler** starting at **Level 28**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group. Its physical makeup consists almost entirely of muscle and shell, making it deceptively heavy (6.5 kg) for its small stature (0.4 m).
