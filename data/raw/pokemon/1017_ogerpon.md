## Identity & Lore
Ogerpon (#1017) is the Mask Pokémon, a legendary entity first discovered during the Generation IX excursions into the land of Kitakami, a territory associated with the Paldea region. Standing 1.2 meters tall, Ogerpon is a humanoid, green-colored Pokémon that is deeply tied to the folklore of its home. It is renowned for its ability to change its elemental properties based on the mask it dons, though in its base state, it is a pure Grass-type. Known for its nimbleness, Ogerpon confounds its enemies with swift, dance-like movements and powerful kicks. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Ogerpon features a unique "Embody Aspect" mechanic; when it Terastallizes, its mask grows to an enormous size, and its ability changes to provide a stat boost that reflects the specific mask it is wearing.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 120, Defense 84, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 96, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With an impressive Attack stat and a Speed tier that outpaces much of the unboosted metagame, Ogerpon functions as a primary offensive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type in its Teal Mask form, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and Speed, Ogerpon’s kit is centered around high-impact physical moves: **Ivy Cudgel** (its signature move with a high critical-hit ratio), **Wood Hammer** (for maximum STAB damage), **Swords Dance** (for offensive setup), and **Play Rough** or **U-turn** (for coverage and tactical pivoting).
* **Abilities:** **Defiant** (Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat by two stages whenever an opponent lowers its stats; this makes Ogerpon a premiere counter to "Intimidate" users and "Sticky Web" hazards).

## Evolution & Biology
Ogerpon is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon, maintaining its form throughout its life cycle. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is unique among Pokémon due to its mask-centric nature; although the base form is pure Grass, Ogerpon can shift into the Wellspring Mask (Grass/Water), Hearthflame Mask (Grass/Fire), or Cornerstone Mask (Grass/Rock) forms when holding the respective items, fundamentally altering its combat profile and biological resonance. It follows a **Slow** growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential.
