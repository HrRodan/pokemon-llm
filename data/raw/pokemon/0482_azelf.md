## Identity & Lore
Azelf (Pokedex #482) is the Legendary **Willpower Pokémon** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. This small, blue, levitating Psychic-type is one of the three **Lake Guardians**, residing at the bottom of **Lake Valor** to maintain the balance of the world. Known as "The Being of Willpower," legends state that Azelf endowed humanity with the determination necessary to face difficulties and achieve their goals. It shares a deep connection with the other guardians, Uxie and Mesprit, and possesses the power to control the will of others or separate their spirit from their body if threatened.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 125, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 70, Speed 115.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper / Suicide Lead.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Psychic type, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** attacks. Crucially, its ability grants it full **immunity to Ground** type moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its exceptional Speed and equal offensive stats (125 Base Attack and Sp. Atk), Azelf is highly versatile. A competitive set often includes **Psychic** (STAB), **Fire Blast** (for coverage against Steel-types), **Nasty Plot** (to sharply boost Special Attack), and **Explosion** (utilizing its high Attack stat for massive damage as a last resort). Alternatively, it often runs **Stealth Rock** and **Taunt** as a lead.
*   **Abilities:** **Levitate** (The Pokémon floats in the air, making it immune to Ground-type moves and spikes).

## Evolution & Biology
Azelf is a **Legendary Pokémon** and does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group and cannot be bred. In the lore of the Sinnoh region, it forms the "Lake Trio" alongside **Uxie** (Knowledge) and **Mesprit** (Emotion), collectively responsible for creating the spirit of humanity.
