## Identity & Lore
Oshawott (Pokedex #501) is the Sea Otter Pokémon first introduced in Generation V (Unova). This blue, bipedal Pokémon is defined by the pale, shell-like weapon on its stomach known as a "scalchop." Made of keratin, the scalchop can be detached and used as a blade for combat or a tool to crack open hard berries. While primarily associated with the Unova region as the Water-type Starter Pokémon, Oshawott is also found in the Sinnoh of the past, known as the Hisui region. Uniquely, while Oshawott remains the same across regions, its evolutionary potential diverges; it can evolve into the standard pure Water-type Samurott or the Water/Dark-type Hisuian Samurott depending on the era and location.

*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its slightly higher Special Attack and access to strong physical signature moves, its optimal kit includes **Hydro Pump** for raw power, **Ice Beam** for coverage against Grass-types, **Razor Shell** (its signature physical STAB that may lower defense), and **Aqua Jet** for priority finishing.

    *   **Shell Armor (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from critical hits, providing defensive consistency.

## Evolution & Biology
Oshawott is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dewott** starting at **Level 17**. Dewott subsequently evolves into **Samurott** starting at **Level 36**. In the Hisui region (Pokemon Legends: Arceus), this final evolution takes the form of Hisuian Samurott. Oshawott belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a medium-slow growth rate.
