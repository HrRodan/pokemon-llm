## Identity & Lore
Mothim (Pokedex #414) is the Moth Pokémon introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. This dual-type **Bug/Flying** creature is visually characterized by its orange wings and yellow body. Mothim is a nomadic species that loves flower nectar but prefers not to gather it; instead, the Pokédex flavor text notes that it aggressively raids the hives of **Combee** to steal the honey they have collected. While its pre-evolution, Burmy, utilizes environmental cloaks (Plant, Sandy, or Trash), Mothim discards these protective coverings upon evolution, adopting a uniform appearance regardless of its previous form. It is an exclusively **male** species, serving as the counterpart to the female-only Wormadam.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 94, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 94, Sp. Def 50, Speed 66.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** Mothim suffers from a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock-type** attacks (making it highly vulnerable to Stealth Rock). It is also weak to **Fire, Flying, Electric, and Ice**. However, it possesses an **Immunity to Ground** and strongly resists **Fighting and Grass (4x resistances)**, as well as Bug-type moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its equal Attack and Special Attack stats, but favoring Special moves due to its setup potential, key moves include **Quiver Dance** (to boost Speed, Sp. Atk, and Sp. Def), **Bug Buzz** (Primary STAB), **Air Slash** (Secondary STAB with flinch chance), and **Energy Ball** (coverage against Rock-types).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swarm:** Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Tinted Lens (Hidden Ability):** Doubles the power of "not very effective" moves. This is tactically vital, allowing Mothim to hit resistant types (like Steel or Fire) for neutral damage.

## Evolution & Biology
Mothim is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from a **male Burmy** starting at **Level 20**. It is distinct from the female variant of the line, which evolves into Wormadam under the same leveling conditions. Notably, while Burmy's form changes based on location, a male Burmy will always evolve into the same standard Mothim phenotype. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
