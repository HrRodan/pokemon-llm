## Identity & Lore
Blastoise (Pokedex #009) is the formidable Shellfish Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This massive, bipedal, blue turtle is defined by the high-pressure water cannons protruding from its shell, which are capable of punching holes through thick steel and striking targets with pinpoint accuracy from over 160 feet away. While its natural habitat is the water's edge, Blastoise is a brutal combatant that plants its heavy feet firmly on the ground to withstand the recoil of its hydro-cannons. In addition to its standard form, Blastoise possesses significant latent potential, capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Blastoise—gaining the Mega Launcher ability—and transforming into a fortress-like **Gigantamax** form.
