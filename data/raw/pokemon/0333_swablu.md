## Identity & Lore
Swablu (Pokedex #333) is the Normal/Flying-type Cotton Bird Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Characterized by its small blue body and two large, fluffy wings that resemble cottony clouds, Swablu inhabits forests where it blends into the sky or foliage. It is known for its friendly and fearless temperament, often landing on the heads of humans and sitting there like a soft hat. Despite its cute appearance, Swablu is obsessed with cleanliness; if it spots something dirty, it will tirelessly wipe it clean with its cotton-like wings, and it immediately washes itself in freshwater if its wings become soiled. While Swablu itself does not have alternative forms, its evolution, Altaria, possesses a powerful Mega Evolution.

    *   **Natural Cure:** Heals all status conditions (burn, paralysis, etc.) when the Pokémon switches out, making it an excellent status absorber.

## Evolution & Biology
Swablu is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Altaria** starting at **Level 35**. Uniquely, while Swablu is a Normal/Flying type, it transitions into a Dragon/Flying type upon evolution, reflecting its placement in the **Flying** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. This biological potential allows it to learn potent Dragon-type moves like Dragon Rush and Outrage even before it evolves.
