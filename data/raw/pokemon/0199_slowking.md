## Identity & Lore
Slowking (Pokedex #199) is the Royal Pokémon, a highly intelligent dual-type Water/Psychic creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Distinct from its counterpart Slowbro, Slowking stands upright and is recognized by the Shellder latching onto its head rather than its tail. This unique symbiosis injects toxins into Slowking's brain, granting it incredible intellect, intuition, and the ability to speak human language in some lore instances. It inhabits the water's edge and is known for its calm, collected demeanor, often serving as a wise leader within Pokémon communities. While the standard form is pink, a regional variant known as **Galarian Slowking** (Poison/Psychic) exists in the Galar region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 75, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 110, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Pivot / Trick Room Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Electric, Grass, Bug, Ghost, and Dark** types. It possesses valuable **resistances to Fire, Water, Ice, Steel, Fighting, and Psychic** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and low Speed, optimal moves include **Chilly Reception** (for pivoting), **Slack Off** (for longevity), **Future Sight** (for delayed pressure), and **Surf** or **Scald** (for STAB damage and status spreading).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from being infatuated, captivated, or taunted.
    *   **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused or being affected by Intimidate.
    *   **Regenerator (Hidden):** Restores 33.3% of maximum HP when the Pokémon switches out. This is its most competitive ability, defining its role as a defensive pivot.

## Evolution & Biology
Slowking is part of a split evolutionary line originating from Slowpoke. It is one of two final forms, the other being Slowbro.
*   **Evolutionary Method:** Slowpoke evolves into Slowking when **traded while holding a King's Rock**. (In the Galar region, a Slowpoke evolves into Galarian Slowking when exposed to a Galarica Wreath).
*   **Biological Traits:** Unlike Slowbro, where the host retains its lethargy, the bite of the Shellder on Slowking's head stimulates its brain constantly. If the Shellder is removed, Slowking reportedly forgets everything it learned and reverts to a normal Slowpoke.
*   **Breeding:** It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** egg groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
