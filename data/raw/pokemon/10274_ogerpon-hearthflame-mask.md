## Identity & Lore
Hearthflame Mask Ogerpon (Pokedex #10274) is the legendary Mask Pokémon, a central figure of the Kitakami region introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). While Ogerpon’s base form is Grass-type, equipping the Hearthflame Mask transforms it into a dual Grass/Fire-type warrior, imbuing it with the ferocity of a blazing fire. Standing 1.2 meters tall and wrapped in its signature green cloak, this humanoid Pokémon is characterized by its nimble, mischievous movements and exceptional kicking prowess. In the lore of the land of Kitakami, Ogerpon was long misunderstood as an "ogre" and feared by the locals, but it is actually a lonely, playful creature that bonds deeply with those it trusts. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Ogerpon possesses a unique mechanic when Terastallizing: its mask grows to a massive size and its ability changes to **Embody Aspect**, boosting its Attack stat to devastating levels.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 120, Defense 84, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 96, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With a high Base Attack of 120 and a Speed tier of 110, Hearthflame Ogerpon is designed to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and deliver heavy physical damage.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Grass/Fire type, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, and Rock**. It effectively neutralizes standard Fire and Ice weaknesses and possesses a **Quadruple Resistance (1/4x)** to Grass-type attacks, while also resisting Electric, Steel, and Fairy moves.
* **Move Selection:** To maximize its high Attack and signature mechanics, key moves include **Ivy Cudgel** (a high-crit signature move that becomes Fire-type in this form), **Horn Leech** (for STAB damage and HP recovery), **Swords Dance** (to escalate its sweeping potential), and **Power Whip** (for raw Grass-type power).
* **Abilities:** **Mold Breaker** (Allows Ogerpon to ignore the defensive abilities of opponents, such as hitting through Sturdy, Multiscale, or Unaware). Upon Terastallizing, this ability becomes **Embody Aspect**, granting an immediate boost to its Attack stat.

## Evolution & Biology
Ogerpon is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. Its biological versatility comes from its "Form Change" mechanic rather than evolution; it changes its secondary typing and special abilities based on which of the four masks it holds. The Hearthflame Mask specifically taps into its inner rage and fire. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, it is noted for its "Slow" growth rate, reflecting the immense amount of experience required for a legendary Pokémon to reach its full potential. Despite its humanoid shape and green coloration, it remains an elusive creature of the mountains, rarely seen by humans without the use of its distinctive masks to hide its true face.
