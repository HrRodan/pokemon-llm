## Identity & Lore
Greninja-Battle-Bond (Pokedex #10116) is the Ninja Pokémon, a specialized variant of the final Water-type starter evolution from Generation VI (Kalos). This form is the result of the "Battle Bond" phenomenon, a rare transformation triggered by the deep connection between the Pokémon and its Trainer, famously manifesting as "Ash-Greninja." While Greninja does not have a traditional Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, this Battle Bond state serves as a biological equivalent, pushing its physical and elemental capabilities to their absolute limits. It is a sleek, humanoid amphibian that uses its long tongue as a scarf and creates lethal throwing stars out of compressed water. These aquatic projectiles are spun at high speeds, capable of splitting solid metal in two.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 72, Attack 95, Defense 67, Sp. Atk 103, Sp. Def 71, Speed 122.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With an elite Speed tier of 122, it is designed to outrun the majority of the unboosted metagame to deliver decisive strikes.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass, Electric, Fighting, Bug, and Fairy**. It possesses a strategic **immunity to Psychic** and provides resistances to Fire, Water, Ice, Steel, Ghost, and Dark-type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and signature mechanics, key moves include **Water Shuriken** (a priority multi-hit move that gains power in this form), **Hydro Pump** for maximum burst damage, **Dark Pulse** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) coverage, and **Ice Beam** to check Grass and Dragon-type threats.
* **Abilities:** Battle Bond (A unique ability that triggers a transformation into Ash-Greninja after the Pokémon successfully knocks out an opponent. In its transformed state, its Water Shuriken move becomes significantly more powerful).

## Evolution & Biology
Greninja-Battle-Bond is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line originating in the Kalos region. It evolves from **Froakie** once it reaches **Level 16** to become **Frogadier**, which then evolves into **Greninja** starting at **Level 36**. Unlike standard Greninja, the Battle Bond variant is a specific form that cannot be obtained through normal evolution of a standard Froakie; it is typically acquired through special events or specific distribution. It belongs to the **Water 1** egg group and has a medium-slow growth rate. Biologically, its 40.0 kg frame is built for extreme acrobatic maneuvers, allowing it to vanish in a blur of motion during combat, embodying the stealth and precision of a master ninja.
