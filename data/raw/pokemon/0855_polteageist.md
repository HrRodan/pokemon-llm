## Identity & Lore
Polteageist (Pokedex #855) is the Black Tea Pokémon, a spectral entity that inhabits antique teapots and was first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. This Ghost-type Pokémon is unique for existing in two distinct states: the "Phony Form," which occupies common counterfeit teapots, and the incredibly rare "Antique Form," which possesses a genuine masterpiece teapot featuring a stamp of authenticity on the underside. Polteageist is known to be formed from tea that has been left alone for a long time; it has a distinct purple hue and can multiply by pouring a portion of its liquid body into leftover cold tea. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its tactical presence in the Galar region is significant due to its signature move, Teatime.

## Evolution & Biology
Polteageist is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sinistea** when exposed to a specific evolutionary item; the item required depends on the Sinistea's authenticity. A Phony Form Sinistea requires a **Cracked Pot** to evolve, while the rare Antique Form Sinistea requires a **Chipped Pot**. Despite being made of liquid, Polteageist belongs to the **Mineral and Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Groups. Biologically, it is a fickle creature; while it allows trusted Trainers to sample its tea, drinking too much can lead to indigestion or even possession, as the "tea" is actually a ghost-infused concoction.
