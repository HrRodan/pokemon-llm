## Identity & Lore
Mega Victreebel (Pokedex #10279) is the Mega Evolved form of the Flycatcher Pokémon, a terrifying apex predator of the rainforests first discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). This massive carnivorous plant grows to a staggering 4.5 meters in height, becoming a towering pitcher plant with a "blob" shaped body and a deep green hue. According to jungle lore, these Pokémon live in enormous colonies deep within tropical wilds, where the sweet, honey-like aroma they exhale lures unsuspecting prey into their acidic maws. It is whispered that no explorer who has stumbled upon a Mega Victreebel colony has ever returned to civilization. While Victreebel is its base form, this Mega Evolution represents the pinnacle of its predatory evolution, enhancing its physical and special capabilities to devastating levels.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 125, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 95, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker. With elite offensive stats in both categories, Mega Victreebel can dismantle defensive cores from either side of the spectrum.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Flying, Ice, and Psychic**. It possesses a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Grass**, and further resists **Water, Electric, Fighting, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Special Attack and high physical power, essential moves include **Leaf Storm** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Sludge Bomb** to threaten Fairy-types and inflict poison, **Solar Beam** (especially effective in Sun-based teams), and **Knock Off** or **Power Whip** to utilize its 125 base Attack.
* **Abilities:** While specific ability data for this Mega form is localized to its mega-stone activation, the lineage is defined by **Chlorophyll** (doubling Speed in harsh sunlight) and **Gluttony**. A Mega form would typically utilize an ability that enhances its digestive themes or weather-based speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Victreebel is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It begins as **Bellsprout**, which evolves into **Weepinbell** starting at Level 21. The transition into a standard **Victreebel** occurs only when Weepinbell is exposed to a **Leaf Stone**. This Mega form is achieved through Mega Evolution during battle when Victreebel holds its specific Mega Stone. Biologically, it belongs to the **Plant** egg group. Its physiology is designed for entrapment; it fills its body with a potent acid that smells like honey but is capable of dissolving almost any organic matter instantly. It is a medium-slow growing species that requires significant training to master its sluggish base Speed, often relying on status-altering moves like **Sleep Powder** or **Stun Spore** to control the battlefield.
