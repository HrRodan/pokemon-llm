## Identity & Lore
Nihilego (Pokedex #793) is the Parasite Pokémon, a mysterious life-form identified as one of the Ultra Beasts, specifically designated by the International Police as UB-01 Symbiont. First discovered during the events in the Alola region (Generation VII), it is composed of a translucent, glass-like substance rather than organic tissue. Despite its ethereal, jellyfish-like appearance, it possesses a sinister biological drive to parasitic attachment; lore suggests it can merge with other organisms, injecting a neurotoxin that stimulates extreme horniness or violent tendencies in its host to protect itself. While it lacks Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its status as an Ultra Beast grants it power comparable to Legendary Pokémon. Its movements are described as mimicking those of a young girl, though whether this is intentional or a mimicry of those it has observed remains a disturbing mystery of Ultra Space.

It also excels as a lead with **Stealth Rock** and **Toxic Spikes**.
* **Abilities:** Beast Boost (Automatically increases the Pokémon’s most proficient stat—usually Special Attack or Speed—by one stage every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to snowball through enemy teams).

## Evolution & Biology
Nihilego is a single-stage Ultra Beast and does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon species. Biologically, it is an extradimensional entity that does not share the reproductive traits of terrestrial Pokémon, belonging to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its growth rate is exceptionally slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its "white" classification, its body is primarily a shimmering, parasitic veil that allows it to float through the air as if it were swimming through water. Though it has no known gender, its behavior suggests a high level of predatory intelligence centered around host manipulation.
