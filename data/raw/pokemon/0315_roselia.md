## Identity & Lore
Roselia (Pokedex #315) is the **Thorn Pokémon**, a dual-type Grass/Poison creature introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Resembling a humanoid plant, Roselia is distinguished by the three-headed flowers on its arms—typically a blue rose on the right and a red rose on the left. It inhabits grasslands where it drinks nutrient-rich spring water. While the aroma of its flowers brings serenity to living things, Roselia is deceptively dangerous; it ruthlessly shoots sharp, toxic thorns at any opponent that attempts to steal the flowers from its arms. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the vital middle stage between the baby Pokémon Budew and the masquerade-themed Roserade.
