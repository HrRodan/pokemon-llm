## Identity & Lore
Volbeat (Pokedex #313) is the Firefly Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A strictly male species, it is the counterpart to the female-only Illumise. Residing primarily in forests near clean water, Volbeat is easily identified by its upright posture and the bulbous light organ on its tail. It utilizes this tail to emit light patterns for communication and mating rituals, often coordinating with others to draw complex geometric shapes in the night sky to attract Illumise. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is distinct for its biological connection to sweet aromas and its role in swarm behavior.

    *   **Swarm:** Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Prankster (Hidden):** The defining competitive ability, giving priority to status moves (like Encore, Thunder Wave, or Tail Glow), allowing Volbeat to act before faster opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Volbeat is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve. However, it is intrinsically linked to the Pokémon **Illumise**; Volbeat eggs can produce either Volbeat (if male) or Illumise (if female). It belongs to the **Bug** and **Human-Like** Egg Groups. In the wild, it is often found holding **Bright Powder**.
