## Identity & Lore
Spheal (Pokedex #363) is the Clap Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This blue, spherical creature resides in icy sea habitats and is famous for its completely round shape. According to ecological research, Spheal moves much faster by rolling along the ground or ice floes than by walking. They are highly social creatures with a distinct feeding behavior; when a group eats, they clap their fins together to express pleasure, making their mealtimes notoriously noisy. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its round stature has made it a distinct mascot within the Pokémon world.
