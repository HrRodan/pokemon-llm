## Identity & Lore
Nuzleaf (Pokedex #274) is the Wily Pokémon, a distinct Grass/Dark dual-type introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A humanoid creature with a brown body and leaf-like growth on its head, Nuzleaf inhabits densely overgrown forests where it uses its environment to play tricks on travelers. Known for its mischievous nature, it occasionally ventures out of the woods to startle people, though it possesses a particular aversion to having its long nose pinched. In broader lore, Nuzleaf is known to pluck leaves from its head and play them as flutes to create unsettling melodies in the forest.
