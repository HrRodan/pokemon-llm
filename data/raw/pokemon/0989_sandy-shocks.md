## Identity & Lore
Sandy Shocks (Pokedex #989) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mysterious quadrupedal entity discovered within the Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero) during Generation IX. Classified as an ancient relative of the contemporary Magneton, Sandy Shocks defies modern biological classification, appearing as a primitive, magnetic organism that uses iron filings and sand to form sturdy, leg-like structures. Its body is composed of three metallic spheres covered in what appears to be magnetic moss or weathered fur, with large screws serving as erratic appendages. According to the Scarlet Book, it closely resembles a creature depicted in an ancient expedition journal, though no formal records of its existence existed until the recent Paldean expeditions. As an Ancient Paradox Pokémon, it represents a prehistoric divergent timeline, distinct from the technological advancement seen in its "Future" counterparts. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique physiological makeup allows it to harness primal terrestrial energy and atmospheric electricity simultaneously.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 81, Defense 97, Sp. Atk 121, Sp. Def 85, Speed 101.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Offensive Utility. With a base Speed of 101 and a formidable Special Attack of 121, it is designed to outspeed mid-tier threats and exert significant pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Water, Grass, and Ice**. It possesses a vital **immunity to Electric** moves and **resists Poison, Rock, Steel, and Flying** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and unique STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) combination, key moves include **Earth Power** for heavy Ground damage, **Thunderbolt** for reliable Electric output, **Volt Switch** for offensive pivoting, and **Power Gem** or **Flash Cannon** for specialized coverage against Ice or Fairy types. It also excels in a utility role using **Stealth Rock** or **Spikes**.
* **Abilities:** Protosynthesis (Increases the Pokémon’s highest stat—usually Special Attack or Speed—by 30%, or 50% if Speed, while in harsh sunlight or if the Pokémon is holding Booster Energy). This makes it a premier threat on "Sun Teams" alongside Torkoal or Koraidon.

## Evolution & Biology
Sandy Shocks is a standalone, single-stage Paradox Pokémon and is not part of a traditional evolutionary line; it does not evolve from Magnemite or Magneton in the current timeline. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is observed "walking" on its lower magnets, which have gathered so much magnetic sand that they function as limbs, allowing it to navigate the rugged, crystal-laden terrain of Area Zero. Its gray, weathered coloration and the presence of iron filings suggest it thrives in high-magnetism environments where it can replenish its metallic mass. With a slow growth rate and high base experience yield, it is considered an elite encounter for high-level trainers.
