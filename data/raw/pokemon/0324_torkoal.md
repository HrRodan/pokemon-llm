## Identity & Lore
Torkoal (Pokédex #324) is the Fire-type Coal Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This quadrupedal, orange-brown tortoise is defined by the furnace burning within its rock-like shell. It fills the hollow spaces of its shell with coal, burning it to generate energy and expelling black smoke from its nostrils and the spout on its back; the velocity of this smoke is a direct indicator of its health. Primarily inhabiting mountains and volcanic craters like Mt. Chimney, Torkoal is known for its unshakeable stoicism and immense physical durability.

## Evolution & Biology
Torkoal is a standalone Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20. While it does not evolve, its shell is permanently fused to its body, acting as a combustion chamber that requires a constant supply of coal to maintain its vitality.
