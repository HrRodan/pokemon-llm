## Identity & Lore
Houndstone (Pokedex #972) is the Ghost Dog Pokémon, a loyal and haunting spectral canine first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This quadrupedal Pokémon is characterized by its white, shaggy fur and the large, tombstone-like protuberance atop its head. According to Paldean lore, Houndstone is the reincarnation of a dog Pokémon that passed away without ever having met a human, yet it is famously known as the most loyal companion a trainer could ask for once a bond is formed. It spends the vast majority of its time dormant, sleeping underground in graveyards with only its stone-like crest exposed to the surface. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or a known Paradox counterpart, its presence in the Paldean wilderness—often near ruins and secluded mountain paths—makes it a staple of the region's spiritual ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 72, Attack 101, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 97, Speed 68.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Late-Game Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ghost-type, it is **weak to Ghost and Dark**. It **resists Poison and Bug**, and possesses total **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Houndstone excels when utilizing its respectable Physical Attack and signature mechanics. Key moves include **Last Respects** (a devastating signature move that increases in power for every fainted ally in the party), **Phantom Force** (for semi-invulnerable STAB damage), **Play Rough** (to check the Dark-types it is weak to), and **Body Press** (which leverages its high base Defense stat to deal damage). 
* **Abilities:** **Sand Rush** is its primary tactical ability, doubling its Speed during a Sandstorm and transforming it into a dangerous weather-reliant sweeper. Its Hidden Ability, **Fluffy**, halves the damage taken from moves that make direct contact, though it compensates for this extreme physical bulk by doubling the damage taken from Fire-type attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Houndstone is the second and final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Greavard** once it reaches **Level 30**, but only if the evolution occurs **at night**. Biologically, it is noted for its immense loyalty; it is said that even after its master passes away, Houndstone will remain by their grave for eternity. Despite its skeletal appearance and graveyard habitat, it is quite friendly and easily excitable, though its habit of inadvertently absorbing the life force of those around it makes it a dangerous pet for the unwary. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles.
