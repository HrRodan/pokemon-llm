## Identity & Lore
Leafeon (Pokedex #470) is the Verdant Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A mammalian quadruped with a cellular structure closer to plants than animals, Leafeon is capable of performing photosynthesis, which results in it being constantly surrounded by clean, crisp air. While it possesses a pacified nature, preferring to sunbathe rather than fight, its tail is razor-sharp and can slice through large trees. It is one of the eight distinct evolutions of Eevee.

## Evolution & Biology
Leafeon is a stage-1 evolution in the branched Eevee family. It evolves from **Eevee** via two distinct methods depending on the game generation: historically by leveling up near a **Moss Rock** (found in locations like Eterna Forest or Pinwheel Forest), or in modern generations by being exposed to a **Leaf Stone**. It belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group.
