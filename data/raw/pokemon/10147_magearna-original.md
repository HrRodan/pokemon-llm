## Identity & Lore
Original Color Magearna (Pokedex #10147) is the Artificial Pokémon, a unique Mythical entity first discovered in the Alola region (Generation VII). This specific form represents Magearna as it appeared 500 years ago when it was first constructed by a scientist of extraordinary genius for a king's daughter. Unlike its modern, faded gray appearance, the Original Color form features a vibrant gold and crimson finish. While it is an artificial construct, Magearna is sentient and possesses the ability to understand human speech, though it lacks the vocal apparatus to respond. Its mechanical body houses the "Soul-Heart," an artificial soul created by gathering the life energy of other Pokémon. In the Pokémon world, this form is considered a rare treasure, often associated with ancient royalty and the zenith of historical engineering.

## Evolution & Biology
Magearna is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It was brought to life through human ingenuity rather than biological evolution. Its metallic, sphere-like lower body allows it to tuck its head and limbs inside to resemble a Poké Ball, a defensive mechanism often used during sleep or when distressed. Biologically, it is classified in the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot breed. As a mechanical being, it has a slow growth rate and lacks a natural habitat, existing primarily where it was stored by its creators or trainers. Despite its clockwork nature, its "Soul-Heart" core grants it true emotions and a protective instinct toward other living beings.
