## Identity & Lore
Popplio (Pokedex #728) is the Sea Lion Pokémon, a blue, pinniped-like creature that first appeared in Generation VII within the tropical Alola region. As one of the three Alolan starter Pokémon, it is recognized for its playful nature and industrious spirit; it is famously known as a hard worker that practices its skills tirelessly. Popplio's most distinctive biological trait is its ability to snort elastic body fluids from its nose to create water balloons, which it uses for both acrobatic play and tactical combat. While Popplio itself does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its final evolution, Primarina, is renowned for its signature Z-Move, "Oceanic Operetta," and its dual Water/Fairy typing.

## Combat Profile

Key moves for its kit include **Hydro Pump** (high-power STAB), **Moonblast** (powerful Fairy coverage foreshadowing its evolution), **Ice Beam** (essential coverage against Grass and Dragon types), and **Hyper Voice** (which gains special properties with its Hidden Ability).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Torrent:** A standard starter ability that increases the power of Water-type moves by 50% when Popplio's HP falls below one-third of its maximum. 
    * **Liquid Voice (Hidden Ability):** A unique tactical ability that converts all sound-based moves (such as Hyper Voice or Sing) into Water-type moves, allowing them to benefit from Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB).

## Evolution & Biology
Popplio is the first stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Brionne** starting at Level 17, and eventually reaches its final form, the soloist Pokémon **Primarina**, at Level 34. Biologically, Popplio is highly adapted to both land and sea; while it is more agile in the water, it uses the elasticity of its bubbles to perform jumps and maneuvers on land. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Field** (Ground) Egg Groups, making it compatible with a wide variety of mammalian and aquatic Pokémon for breeding. With a medium-slow growth rate and a base happiness of 70, it requires dedicated training to reach its full potential as a premier special tank and offensive threat.
