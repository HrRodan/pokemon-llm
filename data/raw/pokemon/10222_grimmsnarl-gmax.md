## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Grimmsnarl (Pokedex #10222) is the formidable Gigantamax form of the Bulk Up Pokémon, originally discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Standing at a staggering 32 meters tall, this purple, humanoid behemoth is characterized by the dense, wiry hair that wraps around its body like a secondary muscular system. This specialized hair enhances its natural strength to such a degree that it is said to easily overwhelm even a Machamp in a contest of raw power. While the base form is a mischievous forest dweller, the Gigantamax phenomenon transforms it into a towering titan capable of manipulating its hair like powerful tentacles to ensnare foes. 

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 120, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 75, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Prankster Utility / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dark/Fairy type, it is **weak to Poison, Steel, and Fairy**. It boasts a **double resistance (0.25x) to Dark** and a standard resistance to **Ghost**. It is uniquely powerful defensively due to its **total immunity to Psychic and Dragon-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 120 Attack and unique utility, key moves include **Spirit Break** (a signature Fairy move that lowers the target's Sp. Atk), **False Surrender** (a Dark-type move that never misses), **Sucker Punch** (to compensate for low speed with priority), and **Reflect** (synergizing with its Prankster ability for instant team protection). When Gigantamaxed, its Dark-type moves transform into **G-Max Snooze**, which has a high chance of making the opponent drowsy.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Prankster:** Grants priority to status moves, making it one of the best screen-setters and disruptors in the competitive meta.
    * **Frisk:** Allows it to identify the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing vital tactical intelligence.
    * **Pickpocket (Hidden):** Steals an opponent's held item when hit by a contact move, punishing physical attackers.

## Evolution & Biology
Grimmsnarl-Gmax represents the peak of a three-stage evolutionary line, all of which are exclusively male. The journey begins with **Impidimp**, a mischievous Dark/Fairy type. Impidimp evolves into **Morgrem** starting at **Level 32**. The line reaches its final form, **Grimmsnarl**, starting at **Level 42**. The Gigantamax form is achieved through the presence of the Gigantamax Factor, often found in Raid Dens within the Galar Wild Area. It belongs to the **Fairy** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups, and despite its monstrous appearance, it is biologically related to other humanoid Pokémon, sharing a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
