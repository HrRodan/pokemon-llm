## Identity & Lore
Lunatone (Pokedex #337) is the Meteorite Pokémon, a dual-type Rock/Psychic creature first discovered in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a yellow crescent moon, this Pokémon possesses deep red eyes and is perpetually airborne. Lunatone was originally found at a meteorite impact site, leading to widespread scientific theories that it originated from outer space, though this has never been definitively proven. It serves as the lunar counterpart to the solar-themed Solrock. Lunatone becomes highly active under the light of a full moon, using its psychic powers to float through the air, and is primarily found inhabiting caves.
