## Identity & Lore
Tatsugiri (Stretchy Form Mega) (Pokedex #10324) is the Mimicry Pokémon, a cunning Dragon/Water-type originally discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This specific "Mega" variant represents an augmented version of its yellow "Stretchy" form. Despite its small, fish-like appearance, it is a true Dragon-type that inhabits the waters of Casseroya Lake. It is famous for its symbiotic, master-and-servant relationship with the massive Pokémon Dondozo; Tatsugiri acts as the brains of the duo, issuing commands from inside Dondozo’s mouth to protect itself from predators while directing the larger Pokémon's movements. While it does not possess a Gigantamax form, its unique biology allows it to change its posture and coloration (Curly, Droopy, and Stretchy forms) to better mimic prey and deceive opponents.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 65, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 125, Speed 92.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper. This form sees a massive increase in its Special Defense and Special Attack, allowing it to serve as a formidable tank against magical and elemental threats while retaliating with devastating force.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Dragon and Fairy**. Thanks to its unique dual typing, it possesses **Double Resistances (1/4x)** to both **Fire and Water**, and a standard resistance to **Steel**. Its Water-type neutralizes the traditional Dragon weakness to Ice.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite 135 Special Attack, key moves include **Draco Meteor** for overwhelming raw power, **Hydro Pump** for high-STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Dragon Pulse** for consistent accuracy, and **Nasty Plot** or **Recover** to further bolster its offensive presence or longevity.
* **Abilities:** While this specific data entry lacks ability text, Tatsugiri typically possesses **Commander**, which allows it to enter a Dondozo's mouth in Double Battles to grant the partner massive stat boosts, or **Storm Drain**, which provides an immunity to Water-type moves while raising its own Special Attack.

## Evolution & Biology
Tatsugiri is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group, and its reproductive biology is characterized by a hatch counter of 35, requiring a moderate amount of travel to incubate. In its Stretchy form, it is known for its bright yellow hue and its ability to elongate its body to mimic various aquatic lifeforms or lures. Biologically, it is extremely intelligent, often playing dead or feigning weakness to lure in foes before striking with draconic energy. In competitive Paldean environments, the Stretchy form specifically enhances the Speed of its Dondozo partner when using the move Order Up.
