## Identity & Lore
Heatran (Pokedex #485) is the Legendary **Lava Dome Pokémon** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Encased in rugged, reddish-brown steel armor created from hardened volcanic magma, it resides deep within volcanic environments such as Stark Mountain. Uniquely adapted to its boiling habitat, Heatran utilizes its distinct cross-shaped feet to dig into solid rock, allowing it to crawl freely on ceilings and walls. Although it is a **Legendary Pokémon**, it holds the unique distinction of having a gender ratio (50% male, 50% female), yet it cannot breed. Lore suggests that without the Magma Stone to control it, Heatran’s body heat would cause the volcano it inhibits to erupt.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 91, Attack 90, Defense 106, Sp. Atk 130, Sp. Def 106, Speed 77.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Attacker / Utility Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** Possessing the unique **Fire/Steel** typing, Heatran has a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground-type** moves, along with standard weaknesses to Fighting and Water. However, it boasts an impressive defensive profile, including an **Immunity to Poison** and **4x Resistances** to Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel, and Fairy types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Special Attack (130) and durability, its optimal moveset includes its signature move **Magma Storm** (which traps opponents), **Flash Cannon** for Steel-type STAB, **Earth Power** for coverage against opposing Fire-types, and the utility move **Stealth Rock** to set entry hazards.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Flash Fire:** Grants immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts the power of its own Fire-type attacks when hit by one. This tactically turns a neutral hit into an immunity.
    *   **Flame Body (Hidden):** Contact with this Pokémon has a 30% chance of burning the attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Heatran is a standalone **Legendary Pokémon** and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it cannot be bred at a Pokémon Nursery, despite possessing a specific gender. In the wild, it is typically encountered at high levels in post-game volcanic areas.
