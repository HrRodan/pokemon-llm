## Identity & Lore
Dusk Form Lycanroc (Pokedex #10152) is the Wolf Pokémon, a unique and rare variant first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This form is a biological anomaly, occurring only when a specific Rockruff is bathed in the setting sun's rays, causing it to manifest traits of both its Midday and Midnight counterparts. It possesses the calm, collected demeanor of the Midday form paired with the intense, hidden fighting spirit of the Midnight form, often signaled by its eyes glowing green when it launches an attack. Physically, it is characterized by its vibrant orange fur and a prominent mane of sharp, obsidian-like rocks. While Lycanroc does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its Dusk Form is famous for its exclusive access to the specialized Z-Move, "Splintered Stormshards," in its debut generation.

## Evolution & Biology
Lycanroc-Dusk is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from a special **Rockruff** possessing the **Own Tempo** ability. The evolution occurs when Rockruff reaches **Level 25** specifically during the **dusk timeframe** (traditionally 5:00 PM to 5:59 PM in-game time). This evolutionary trigger is highly sensitive to the atmosphere, reflecting the Pokémon's deep connection to solar energy. Biologically, it is a quadruped hunter that uses the rocks in its mane to slash at foes, and its quick movements are designed to confuse prey in the rugged, mountainous terrain of Alola. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and is known for its intense loyalty once a bond is formed with a Trainer.
