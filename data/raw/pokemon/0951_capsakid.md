## Identity & Lore
Capsakid (Pokedex #951) is the Spicy Pepper Pokémon, a diminutive but pungent creature introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This small, green-colored Pokémon is characterized by its large, toothy mouth and a head that resembles a serrated pepper bulb. Biologically, Capsakid is fascinating for its chemical composition; it absorbs sunlight to fuel the production of spicy compounds within its body. This internal heat is reflected in its lore, which states that the more sunlight it bathes in, the spicier and more potent its moves become. While Capsakid itself is a pure Grass-type, it is the precursor to Scovillain, the first Pokémon in the franchise to possess the unique Grass/Fire dual-typing. While Capsakid does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts, its biological potential for fire-based chemistry is a rarity among base-stage Grass types.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 62, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 62, Sp. Def 40, Speed 50.

* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug**. It **resists Water, Grass, Electric, and Ground** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its balanced offensive stats, key moves for Capsakid include **Energy Ball** (high-consistency Special STAB), **Leaf Storm** (maximum burst damage), **Seed Bomb** (reliable Physical STAB), and **Rage Powder** (essential redirection utility for doubles/VGC).
* **Abilities:** **Chlorophyll** (Doubles its Speed stat in harsh sunlight, making it a viable Sun-team sweeper); **Insomnia** (Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep, a hard counter to Spore or Yawn users); **Klutz** (Hidden Ability: Prevents the use of held items, which is generally a competitive hindrance but can be used with Switcheroo in niche strategies).

## Evolution & Biology
Capsakid is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Scovillain** when exposed to a **Fire Stone**, a unique transformation that grants it a second head and the Fire sub-type. This evolution reflects the "ripening" of its spicy chemicals into actual flames. Biologically, it is a hardy plant that thrives in the arid and rocky regions of Paldea. It belongs to the **Plant** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders. Its growth rate is medium, allowing it to reach competitive levels at a standard pace.
