## Identity & Lore
Victreebel (Pokedex #071) is the carnivorous Flycatcher Pokémon indigenous to the forests and jungles of Generation I (Kanto). This botanical predator is defined by its large, pitcher-like body filled with acid capable of dissolving prey—including bones—within a day. According to Pokédex lore, Victreebel dwell in massive colonies deep within uncharted jungles, zones from which no explorer has ever returned. It mimics a sweet aroma to lure victims close before swallowing them whole. Unlike many other Kanto natives, it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form.
