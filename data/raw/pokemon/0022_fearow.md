## Identity & Lore
Fearow (Pokédex #022) is the large, brown **Beak Pokémon** known for its aggressive temperament and impressive endurance. Originating from **Generation I (Kanto)**, this Normal/Flying-type typically inhabits **rough terrain** and wastelands. It is characterized by its long neck and huge, magnificent wings, which allow it to catch air currents and stay aloft for an entire day without ever needing to land or rest. Unlike its contemporary Pidgeot, Fearow has not received a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Regional Variant.
