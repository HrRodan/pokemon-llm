## Identity & Lore
Natu (Pokedex #177) is the Tiny Bird Pokémon, a Psychic/Flying-type creature first discovered in **Generation II (Johto)**. Small and spherical with a primarily green body and vestigial red wings, Natu inhabits forest environments where it forages for food on the ground. Because its wings are not yet fully grown, it cannot fly effectively and must hop to move around; however, it is surprisingly agile and can jump higher than adult humans to peck at tree buds. Lore descriptions emphasize its distinct behavior of staring fixedly at objects or nothing at all, hinting at the latent psychic foresight that fully manifests in its evolution. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its unique combination of traits makes it a distinct presence in the Little Cup competitive tier.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 50, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 45, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Attacker / Utility Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** As a dual Psychic/Flying type, it is **weak to Rock, Electric, Ice, Ghost, and Dark** moves. It possesses a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Fighting** and resists Grass. It is completely **immune to Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Speed and Special Attack, key moves include **Psychic** (primary STAB), **Air Slash** (secondary STAB with flinch chance), **Heat Wave** (vital coverage against Steel-types), and **Roost** (reliable health recovery).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Synchronize:** Passes poison, paralyze, or burn to the Pokémon that inflicted it.
    *   **Early Bird:** The Pokémon awakens from sleep twice as fast as other Pokémon.
    *   **Magic Bounce (Hidden Ability):** Reflects non-attacking moves (like entry hazards, status moves, and Taunt) back at the attacker. This is a highly valuable competitive trait.

## Evolution & Biology
Natu is the base stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the mystic **Xatu** starting at **Level 25**. Unlike many bird Pokémon that rely on flight, Natu's biology forces it to remain grounded until evolution, where it gains significant psychic power and flight capabilities. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and hatches quickly compared to other species.
