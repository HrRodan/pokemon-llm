## Identity & Lore
Pachirisu (National Dex #417) is the **EleSquirrel Pokémon**, a pure Electric-type introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Recognized by its white fur and distinctive light blue stripe, this quadrupedal rodent is the regional electric mascot for the Sinnoh region. Biologically, Pachirisu generates static electricity in its cheek pouches and creates electrified fur balls, which it hides alongside berries in tree hollows to protect its food stash. While unassuming in appearance, Pachirisu holds a legendary status in competitive Pokémon lore due to its unexpected durability and utility, most famously anchoring a World Championship winning team in the Masters Division (2014) through expert use of redirection tactics.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 45, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 90, Speed 95.
*   **Archetype:** **Fast Support / Redirection Tank**. Despite its diminutive offensive stats, Pachirisu excels as a disruptor thanks to its high Speed and surprising Special Defense bulk.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground** moves. It **resists Flying, Steel, and Electric** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Because its offensive stats (45/45) are negligible, Pachirisu relies on utility and fixed-damage attacks. An optimal set includes **Follow Me** (to redirect attacks away from allies), **Super Fang** (halves the target's HP regardless of defenses), **Nuzzle** (guaranteed paralysis while dealing chip damage), and **Volt Switch** (to pivot out while maintaining momentum).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Run Away:** Guarantees escape from wild battles; generally has no competitive use.
    *   **Pickup:** Allows the Pokémon to find items after battle; useful for in-game resource gathering.
    *   **Volt Absorb (Hidden):** The superior competitive choice. It grants immunity to Electric-type moves and restores 25% of maximum HP when hit by one, allowing Pachirisu to switch into Thunder Waves or Thunderbolts safely.

## Evolution & Biology
Pachirisu is a **single-stage Pokémon** with no evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** and **Fairy** Egg Groups, making it compatible for breeding with a wide variety of species including Pikachu and Clefairy. It has a relatively fast hatch cycle (approx. 10 cycles), and its gender ratio is evenly split (50% male, 50% female).
