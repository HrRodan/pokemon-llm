## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Rillaboom (Pokedex #10209) is the towering Gigantamax form of the Drummer Pokémon, a massive Grass-type originally discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). In this form, its power surges to such a degree that its single tree stump has transformed into a colossal forest of drums. Standing at a staggering 28 meters tall, it uses its immense strength to wield long drumsticks, controlling the roots of its stump through rhythmic beats to strike enemies from below. Lore describes it as a master percussionist whose drumming can be heard across entire regions, tapping into the spiritual power of the forest to command nature itself. While it primarily exists in the Galar region, its presence is a hallmark of the Max Raid dens and competitive Dynamax battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Rillaboom-Gmax is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as the Grass-type starter **Grookey**, which evolves into **Thwackey** starting at Level 16. Thwackey then evolves into the standard **Rillaboom** at Level 35. To achieve this specific Gigantamax form, a Rillaboom must possess the **Gigantamax Factor**, typically obtained by consuming Max Soup in the Isle of Armor. Biologically, it is a humanoid-shaped creature belonging to both the **Ground and Plant Egg Groups**, with a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its medium-slow growth rate and the dedication required to raise this powerful forest guardian.
