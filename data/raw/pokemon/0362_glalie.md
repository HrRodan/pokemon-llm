## Identity & Lore
Glalie (Pokedex #362) is the Face Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Generation III (Hoenn)** region. This pure Ice-type creature possesses a body composed of black rock, which it consciously hardens with an armor of ice. Using its ability to control temperature, Glalie can instantly freeze moisture in the atmosphere to form intricate shapes or immobilize prey. Typically found dwelling in caves, it floats using magnetic forces. While its standard form is spherical, it is capable of **Mega Evolution** into Mega Glalie, where its jaw unhinges to release massive energy.
