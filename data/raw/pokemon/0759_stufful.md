## Identity & Lore
Stufful (Pokedex #759) is the Flailing Pokémon, a deceptive Normal and Fighting-type creature first discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. Despite its small, pink, quadrupedal appearance resembling a stuffed toy—complete with a white tag under its tail—it possesses extraordinary physical strength. Its flavor text warns that when this Pokémon is agitated, its flailing limbs can easily send a professional wrestler sprawling. Stufful is notoriously averse to being touched and will react violently to unwanted physical contact. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its evolved form, Bewear, is feared throughout the Alola region as one of the most dangerous predators in the wild due to its bone-crushing hugs.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 75, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 50, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Physical Bruiser / Bulky Attacker. In its unevolved state, Stufful relies on its decent HP and Attack to trade hits, though its Speed is notably low.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its high physical Attack stat, Stufful is most effective with moves like **Hammer Arm** (powerful STAB), **Double-Edge** (high-damage STAB), **Ice Punch** (essential coverage for Flying-type weaknesses), and **Swords Dance** to further boost its offensive pressure.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Fluffy:** Halves damage taken from moves that make contact, though it doubles the damage taken from Fire-type moves. This provides Stufful with surprising physical bulk.
    * **Klutz:** Prevents the Pokémon from using or benefiting from held items.
    * **Cute Charm (Hidden Ability):** Has a 30% chance to infatuate an attacker of the opposite gender upon contact.

## Evolution & Biology
Stufful is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the much larger and more powerful **Bewear** starting at **Level 27**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group, and its growth is classified as medium. Breeding programs note a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively straightforward to raise. Its biology is characterized by a mix of mammalian traits and synthetic-looking features, though it is a fully organic, biological organism that inhabits forested areas.
