## Identity & Lore
Dunsparce (Pokedex #206) is the Land Snake Pokémon, a Normal-type species introduced in Generation II (Johto). Resembling the mythical Japanese cryptid known as the Tsuchinoko, this yellow, serpentine creature prefers dark, subterranean environments and is most commonly found in **caves**. Although it possesses small, vestigial wings, Dunsparce is flightless and can only hover slightly above the ground. It is timid by nature; when spotted, it escapes backward by furiously boring into the earth with its drill-like tail. While it was a standalone Pokémon for many years, recent biological discoveries in the Paldea region revealed it is capable of evolution.
