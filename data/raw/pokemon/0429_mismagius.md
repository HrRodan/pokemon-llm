## Identity & Lore
Mismagius (Pokedex #429) is the **Magical Pokémon**, a pure Ghost-type entity introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Resembling a stylized witch or mage, its body is draped in purple, robe-like folds, and its head features a shape reminiscent of a wide-brimmed wizard's hat. Mismagius is renowned for its vocal abilities; its cries sound like eerie incantations that can torment listeners with headaches and hallucinations, though legends suggest its chants can also bestow happiness. While it has no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares a striking resemblance to the ancient Paradox Pokémon, **Flutter Mane**, found in the Paldea region.
