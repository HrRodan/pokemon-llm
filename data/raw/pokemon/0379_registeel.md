## Identity & Lore
Registeel (Pokedex #379) is the Legendary **Iron Pokémon**, a member of the Legendary Titans (often called the "Regis") originally discovered in the **Hoenn** region (Generation III). Created by Regigigas during the Iron Age, this entity was sealed away in ancient ruins by humans who feared its immense durability. Its spherical body is composed of a mysterious, unearthly metal that is harder than any known substance on Earth, yet surprisingly flexible, capable of shrinking and stretching. Despite its metallic exterior, scans reveal that Registeel is completely hollow inside, and it consumes no known food, raising questions about what fuels its existence. It is typically found deep within ancient ruins, such as the Ancient Tomb in Hoenn or the Iron Ruins in Sinnoh.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 75, Defense 150, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 150, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Wall / Defensive Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Steel-type**, it possesses excellent defensive utility. It is **weak to Fire, Fighting, and Ground**. However, it is **immune to Poison** and boasts a vast array of resistances including **Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its colossal Defense stat, Registeel operates best using **Body Press**, which calculates damage based on Defense rather than Attack. To support this, **Iron Defense** is essential to simultaneously boost survivability and damage output. For utility and field control, **Stealth Rock** is a staple choice, while **Heavy Slam** (or **Flash Cannon**) provides consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) coverage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Clear Body:** Prevents the Pokémon's stats from being lowered by opposing moves or abilities (e.g., ignoring Intimidate or Sticky Web).
    *   **Light Metal** (Hidden): Halves the Pokémon's weight. (Generally less optimal for Registeel, as it reduces the power of weight-based moves like Heavy Slam).

## Evolution & Biology
Registeel is a non-evolving Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It stands alongside Regirock, Regice, Regieleki, and Regidrago as one of the titans presided over by Regigigas. Being a Legendary construct, it belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot be bred. In the lore of the games, awakening Registeel usually requires solving complex Braille puzzles within the Sealed Chamber or specific ruins to unlock its containment unit.
