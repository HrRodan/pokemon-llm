## Identity & Lore
Blissey (Pokedex #242) is the Happiness Pokémon, a Normal-type creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Renowned for its compassionate nature, this pink, humanoid Pokémon inhabits urban environments and is frequently associated with Pokémon Centers and healing roles. Its lore states that anyone who ingests even a single bite of the egg Blissey carries will become unfailingly caring and pleasant to others. It is the final evolutionary stage of the Happiny line. While Blissey does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its immense durability makes it a legendary figure in defensive battling strategies.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 255, Attack 10, Defense 10, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 135, Speed 55.
*   **Archetype:** Special Wall / Cleric. With the highest base HP of all Pokémon and exceptional Special Defense, Blissey serves as the premier "sponge" for special attacks.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and holds an **immunity to Ghost**. As a pure Normal-type, it has no natural resistances, relying entirely on its raw bulk to withstand damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Defense and support capabilities, key moves include **Soft-Boiled** (instant recovery), **Seismic Toss** (consistent fixed damage compensating for low Attack), **Heal Bell** (curing team status conditions), and **Flamethrower** (utilizing its decent Sp. Atk for coverage against Steel-types).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Natural Cure:** Heals all status conditions (burn, paralysis, etc.) when the Pokémon switches out, making it an excellent pivot.
    *   **Serene Grace:** Doubles the chance of a move's secondary effect occurring.
    *   **Healer (Hidden):** May heal an ally's status condition at the end of the turn in Double Battles.
