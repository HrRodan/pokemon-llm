## Identity & Lore
Whiscash (Pokedex #340) is the Whiskers Pokémon, a large, territorial catfish native to the **Hoenn** region (**Generation III**). Distinguished by its dark blue coloration and long, sensitive whiskers, this species is found primarily in swamps and at the water's edge. Whiscash possesses a surprisingly aggressive temperament; it claims large ponds as its exclusive domain and will thrash violently to trigger massive earthquakes if a foe approaches. While it appears lethargic, its ability to sense subtle vibrations allows it to predict enemy movements. Whiscash does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 78, Defense 73, Sp. Atk 76, Sp. Def 71, Speed 60.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Setup Sweeper / Mixed Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Water/Ground** type, Whiscash possesses a distinct defensive profile. It has a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass** types. However, it is immune to **Electric** attacks and resists **Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel**.
*   **Move Selection:** Whiscash functions best by utilizing its bulk to set up stat boosts. A competitive moveset includes **Dragon Dance** (to boost Attack and Speed), **Earthquake** (powerful STAB), **Liquidation** (Physical Water STAB), and **Stone Edge** (for coverage against Flying types). Alternatively, it can utilize **Scald** and **Earth Power** for a special attacking set.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from being infatuated or falling for taunts, ensuring it can safely use support moves like Dragon Dance.
    *   **Anticipation:** Sensing danger, the Pokémon shudders when it detects that the opponent has a super-effective move (useful for scouting Grass attacks).
    *   **Hydration (Hidden):** Heals all status conditions at the end of the turn if it is raining.

## Evolution & Biology
Whiscash is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Barboach** starting at **Level 30**. While Barboach tends to hide in mud to avoid predators, Whiscash becomes an apex territorial force upon evolution. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group, often requiring 20 egg cycles to hatch.
