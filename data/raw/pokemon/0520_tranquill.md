## Identity & Lore
Tranquill (Pokedex #520) is the Wild Pigeon Pokémon, a distinctive avian species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This gray-feathered Pokémon is renowned for its unparalleled sense of direction; it is said that no matter how far it travels from its Trainer, it can always find its way back home without fail. While it lacks a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, Tranquill is celebrated in the Pokémon world for its peaceful nature, though it is fiercely loyal when called into battle. It is commonly found in the forests and urban parks of Unova, serving as a reliable partner for beginning Trainers.

## Evolution & Biology
Tranquill represents the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pidove** starting at level 21 and eventually evolves into the powerful **Unfezant** beginning at level 32. In its final form, it displays significant gender dimorphism, with males sporting prominent pink floral plumage. Tranquill belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it a relatively common sight for breeders. Its biological composition is optimized for endurance flight, reflected in its medium-slow growth rate and the ability to traverse vast distances without losing its bearings.
