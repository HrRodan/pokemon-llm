## Identity & Lore
Sigilyph (Pokedex #561) is the Avianoid Pokémon, a mysterious and ancient entity first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its black, multi-colored, and geometric body that resembles a Nazca line or an ancient relic, Sigilyph is often found patrolling the skies above desert ruins, specifically the Desert Resort. According to Unovan legends, these Pokémon served as the eternal guardians of ancient cities. They are known for their unwavering nature, never varying their flight paths because their memories of protecting their lost civilizations remain steadfast. While Sigilyph does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its cryptic design and connection to ancient technology have led many researchers to speculate on its extra-terrestrial or artificial origins.

## Evolution & Biology
Sigilyph is a standalone species and is not part of any evolutionary chain, representing a unique biological or mechanical lineage that does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. Biologically, it is highly adapted for aerial life, possessing a shape categorized by its wide, ornate wings. Despite its mechanical appearance, it belongs to the **Flying** egg group. Trainers looking to breed Sigilyph should note its hatch counter of 20, which is standard for many avian species. Its steadfast behavior and historical role as a guardian suggest it possesses a high level of intelligence and a psychic connection to the land it protects.
