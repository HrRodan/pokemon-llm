## Identity & Lore
Shelmet (Pokedex #616) is the Snail Pokémon, first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its heavy, screw-lidded grey shell and its pink, pouting face, Shelmet is a remarkably defensive organism. It primarily dwells in bogs and marshes, where it defends itself from its natural predator, Karrablast, by tightly closing its shell lid. Lore dictates that Shelmet can spit a sticky, poisonous liquid to deter attackers. While Shelmet does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its biological existence is inextricably linked to Karrablast through a unique co-evolutionary process where it sheds its heavy shell to achieve incredible speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Shelmet is part of a two-stage evolutionary line with one of the most unique triggers in the Pokémon world. It evolves into **Accelgor** only when **traded specifically for a Karrablast**. During the trade, the electrical energy causes Shelmet to lose its shell to the Karrablast, resulting in Shelmet becoming the lightning-fast Accelgor while Karrablast becomes the heavily armored Escavalier. Shelmet belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive play.
