## Identity & Lore
Ninjask (Pokedex #291) is the dual-type Bug/Flying "Ninja Pokémon" introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in forests, this yellow, insectoid creature is renowned for its blinding velocity. It moves at such extreme speeds that it becomes virtually invisible to the naked eye, leading to historical misconceptions that it was a spirit entity rather than a biological organism. While it often cannot be seen, its presence is announced by a distinctive, piercing cry that causes headaches if heard for too long. Ninjask is the evolved form of the terrestrial Nincada and is uniquely linked to the creation of the mysterious Pokémon Shedinja during the evolution process.

## Evolution & Biology
Ninjask is part of a unique two-stage evolutionary line found in the Bug Egg Group. It evolves from **Nincada** starting at **Level 20**. This evolution event is biologically distinct; when Nincada sheds its exoskeleton to become Ninjask, the discarded shell can become animated as a separate Pokémon, **Shedinja**, provided the trainer has an extra Poké Ball and an open slot in their party.
