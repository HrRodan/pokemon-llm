## Identity & Lore
Magcargo (Pokédex #219) is the Lava Pokémon, a Fire/Rock-type entity introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Residing primarily in mountainous volcanic regions, this Pokémon's body is composed of scorching magma. The shell on its back is not a separate biological structure, but rather skin that has cooled and hardened into a brittle, rock-like formation that breaks easily upon impact. While it appears slow and sluggish, Magcargo's body temperature is intensely high, capable of vaporizing water instantly. It does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 50, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 80, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** Its defensive typing is a high-risk, high-reward configuration. It suffers from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Water and Ground** types, while also being weak to **Fighting and Rock**. However, it strongly **resists Fire, Normal, Flying, Poison, Bug, Ice, and Fairy** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its significantly higher Special Attack and low Speed, Magcargo operates best with utility and special offense. Key moves include **Lava Plume** (for STAB and burn chance), **Power Gem** (reliable Rock STAB), **Earth Power** (coverage against Rock types), and **Shell Smash** (to drastically boost its offenses and speed at the cost of defense). **Recover** is also a viable option for a purely defensive build.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Magma Armor:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming frozen.
    *   **Flame Body:** Contact with this Pokémon has a 30% chance of burning the attacker, punishing physical strikers.
    *   **Weak Armor (Hidden):** When hit by a physical move, Defense is lowered but Speed is sharply raised, synergizing well with Shell Smash sets.

## Evolution & Biology
Magcargo is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Slugma** starting at **Level 38**. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group. The transition from Slugma to Magcargo marks the hardening of the magma skin into a protective, albeit fragile, shell structure.
