## Identity & Lore
Sawk (Pokedex #539) is the Karate Pokémon, a humanoid creature introduced in Generation V (Unova). Distinguished by its blue, stony skin and a natural pattern that resembles a martial arts gi, Sawk is a martial arts specialist that spends its life training in the deep mountains to achieve ultimate power. It is frequently associated with its counterpart, Throh, though Sawk prioritizes speed and striking over its counterpart's grappling techniques. While Sawk currently lacks a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it is renowned for its sheer physical discipline; the sound of it punching trees and boulders can be heard for miles. It is a strictly all-male species that is often found tightening its belt to increase its concentration and power.

## Evolution & Biology
Sawk is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve from or into any other species. Biologically, it is built for endurance and high-intensity striking, belonging to the **Humanshape** egg group. It has a medium growth rate and is known to be found in the wild holding items that enhance its martial prowess, such as a **Black Belt** or an **Expert Belt**. Because it is an all-male species, it must be bred with a Ditto to produce more Sawk.
