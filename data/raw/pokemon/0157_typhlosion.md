## Identity & Lore
Typhlosion (Pokedex #157) is the Volcano Pokémon, serving as the final evolution of the Fire-type starter from **Generation II (Johto)**. Characterized by its explosive temperament, this quadrupedal beast possesses a yellow and dark blue coloration and typically inhabits grasslands. According to lore, when its rage peaks, its body temperature rises to such extremes that anything touching it instantly bursts into flames. It has the ability to create massive explosions by rubbing its blazing fur together to generate kinetic heat. While the standard form is pure Fire-type, **World Knowledge** dictates the existence of a regional variant, **Hisuian Typhlosion**, which is a Fire/Ghost type native to the ancient Hisui region.
