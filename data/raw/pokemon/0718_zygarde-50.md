## Identity & Lore
Zygarde-50 (Pokedex #718) is the Order Pokémon, a legendary Dragon and Ground-type entity first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Characterized by its serpent-like, green-and-black "squiggle" shape, Zygarde serves as the biological warden of the ecosystem; it is said to monitor the balance of the world from deep within its cave and reveal its secret power whenever the environment falls into disarray. While this specific manifestation represents Zygarde at 50% of its total cellular capacity, it is part of a complex biological system involving **Zygarde Cells** and **Zygarde Cores**. Though it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it can transcend into its humanoid **Complete Forme**—a state that surpasses even Alpha Pokémon in raw power—when its health is depleted, provided it possesses the Power Construct ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Zygarde is a unique legendary that does not evolve through levels or stones, but rather through the assembly of its components. It is a single-stage entity that changes forms based on the accumulation of Zygarde Cells. The 50% Forme is its primary defensive state, used to maintain order in the Kalos and Alola regions. Biologically, it is part of the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred, and it follows a **Slow growth rate**, requiring 1,250,000 experience points to reach level 100. Its presence is often heralded by the moves **Land's Wrath**, **Thousand Waves**, and **Core Enforcer**, which signify its role as the ultimate arbiter of the natural world.
