## Identity & Lore
Haxorus (Pokedex #612) is the Axe Jaw Pokémon, a powerful bipedal Dragon-type originally discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. It is instantly recognizable by its sturdy, armor-like scaly hide—noted for being a golden-yellow hue—and its most fearsome feature: massive, black, scythe-like tusks protruding from its jaw. While its appearance is intimidating and its nature is relentless when defending its territory, Haxorus is surprisingly kind-hearted and generally non-aggressive unless provoked. Its tusks are remarkably durable, capable of slicing through thick steel beams with ease, and Haxorus takes great care to maintain them by licking the dirt off after a battle. Although it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, Haxorus remains a top-tier physical threat in the Dragon hierarchy, often compared to pseudo-legendary Pokémon due to its overwhelming raw power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 76, Attack 147, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 70, Speed 97.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It **resists Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** With a monumental base Attack of 147, Haxorus focuses exclusively on physical devastation and setup. Key moves in its repertoire include **Dragon Dance** (to patch up its middling Speed and boost its power), **Outrage** (for high-yield STAB damage), **Earthquake** (essential coverage that pairs with its ability), and **Poison Jab** (to check incoming Fairy-type threats). 
* **Abilities:** **Mold Breaker** is its most competitive ability, allowing Haxorus to ignore defensive abilities like Levitate (allowing Earthquake to hit Rotom or Flygon) or Sturdy. **Rivalry** increases damage against foes of the same gender but decreases it against the opposite, while its hidden ability, **Unnerve**, prevents opponents from eating their held Berries, disrupting defensive strategies like Sitrus or Shuca Berry recovery.

## Evolution & Biology
Haxorus is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Axew**, which is known for its relatively timid nature. Axew evolves into **Fraxure** starting at Level 38, at which point its tusks begin to grow significantly more robust. Finally, Fraxure evolves into **Haxorus** starting at Level 48. This late evolution cycle is typical of high-power Dragon-types found in the Unova region. Biologically, it belongs to both the **Monster** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. It has a slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 40, requiring significant patience from trainers to raise from an egg to its fully evolved, armored form.
