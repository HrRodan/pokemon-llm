## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Gengar (Pokedex #10202) is the towering, G-Max variant of the Shadow Pokémon, originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). This specific form manifests through the Power of Dynamax in the Galar region, transforming the mischievous spirit into a colossal, stationary maw of spectral energy. Standing at a staggering 20 meters tall, its mouth is rumored to lead not to an internal organ, but to the afterlife itself. Its flavor text notes that it delights in mimicking the shadows of people under a full moon to mock their terror. Beyond this Gigantamax state, Gengar is known for its extreme genetic instability and potential for transformation, possessing a powerful **Mega Evolution** (Mega Gengar) characterized by the Shadow Tag ability. While it does not have a Paradox form, its presence across every generation solidifies its status as the premier Ghost-type icon of the Pokémon world.

In its G-Max state, its Ghost-type moves transform into **G-Max Terror**, which prevents opponents from fleeing or switching out.

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Gengar is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Gastly**, which evolves into **Haunter** starting at Level 25. The transition to its final form, **Gengar**, is unique as it is triggered only when **Haunter is traded** between trainers. To achieve the Gigantamax form specifically, a Gengar must possess the Gigantamax Factor, often acquired by consuming Max Soup in the Isle of Armor or being encountered in specialized Max Raid Dens. Biologically, it belongs to the **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Group, reflecting its gaseous and semi-corporeal nature. Despite its massive G-Max weight of 1000kg, it retains its purple, shadowy essence and a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full combat potential.
