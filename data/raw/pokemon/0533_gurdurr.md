## Identity & Lore
Gurdurr (Pokedex #533) is the Muscular Pokémon, a robust bipedal creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its incredibly disciplined physique and gray, bulbous skin, Gurdurr is famously depicted carrying a heavy steel I-beam, which it uses both as a tool for construction and a devastating weapon in battle. According to its lore, this Pokémon is so immensely strong and well-planted that even a coordinated group of professional wrestlers could not move it an inch. Gurdurr is frequently found near construction sites, assisting human workers with heavy lifting and structural assembly. While Gurdurr does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Conkeldurr, is renowned for its immense power, and the line is often seen as the spiritual successor to the Machamp evolutionary family.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 105, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 50, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Attacker. Gurdurr excels in sustained physical combat, especially when equipped with an **Eviolite** to bolster its Defense and Special Defense.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** To maximize its high Attack stat and circumvent its low Speed, Gurdurr relies on a mixture of priority and recovery moves. Key selections include **Drain Punch** (for STAB damage and healing), **Mach Punch** (crucial priority to strike first), **Knock Off** (for utility and removing foe's items), and **Ice Punch** (to provide coverage against Flying and Ground types).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Guts:** Increases Attack by 50% if the Pokémon is inflicted with a status condition (Burn, Paralysis, Poison). It also ignores the Attack-halving effect of a Burn.
    * **Sheer Force:** Removes additional effects (like flinch or stat drops) from moves to increase their raw power by 30%.
    * **Iron Fist (Hidden Ability):** Boosts the power of punching-based moves (like Drain Punch and Mach Punch) by 20%.

## Evolution & Biology
Gurdurr is the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Timburr** starting at **Level 25**. To reach its final form, **Conkeldurr**, Gurdurr must be **traded** to another trainer, a process that triggers its final growth spurt and the transition from carrying steel beams to massive concrete pillars. Biologically, Gurdurr belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group, reflecting its humanoid anatomy and high level of intelligence regarding tool use. It has a hatch counter of 20, requiring a moderate amount of travel to hatch from an egg.
