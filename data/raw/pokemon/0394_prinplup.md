## Identity & Lore
Prinplup (Pokedex #394) is the Penguin Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A solitary creature by nature, this blue, upright avian lives apart from others of its kind because every individual pridefully believes itself to be the most important. Despite its elegant appearance, Prinplup possesses powerful wings capable of snapping thick trees with a single blow. It is the intermediate stage of the Sinnoh Water-type starter line, bridging the gap between the adorable Piplup and the regal Empoleon.
