## Identity & Lore
Clefable-Mega (Pokedex #10278) is the ascended form of the Fairy Pokémon, representing the pinnacle of its lunar-influenced biology. Originally discovered in the mountains of the Kanto region (Generation I), this variant manifests as a dual Fairy and Flying type, likely a result of its deep connection to the moon and its ethereal, floating movements. Characterized by its pink, upright silhouette and timid nature, it is said to run and hide the moment it senses human presence, using its enhanced sensory capabilities to remain elusive. While the base species is known for its rarity, the Mega-evolved state represents a significant surge in celestial power, drawing upon the same cosmic energy that fueled its evolution from its predecessors.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 80, Defense 93, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 110, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper. With a massive Special Attack stat and significant special bulk, it serves as a potent wallbreaker that can sustain hits from many specialized attackers.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison, Steel, Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It possesses **Double Resistances (1/4x) to Fighting and Bug**, and standard resistances to **Grass and Dark**. It is **immune to Dragon and Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and its dual typing, key moves include **Moonblast** (powerful Fairy STAB), **Air Slash** (Flying STAB with a flinch chance), **Flamethrower** (essential coverage for Steel-type threats), and **Soft-Boiled** or **Moonlight** (vital recovery to leverage its bulk).
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-abilities are often localized to the transformation stone, this Pokémon typically retains the tactical utility of its lineage, such as **Magic Guard** (protection from indirect damage) or **Unaware** (ignoring enemy stat boosts), though the Mega form focuses primarily on raw offensive and defensive stat amplification.

## Evolution & Biology
Clefable-Mega is the final stage of a four-part progression. It begins its life as **Cleffa**, a baby Pokémon that evolves into **Clefairy** when leveled up with High Friendship (minimum 160 happiness). Clefairy then evolves into **Clefable** upon exposure to a **Moon Stone**. The transition to the Mega form is a temporary transformation triggered during battle when Clefable holds its specific Mega Stone. As part of the **Fairy** egg group, it remains closely tied to mystical habitats and mountain peaks, where its "fast" growth rate allows it to quickly reach its full combat potential.
