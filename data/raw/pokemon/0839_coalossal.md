## Identity & Lore
Coalossal (Pokedex #839) is the Coal Pokémon, a massive bipedal entity of smoldering stone and heat introduced in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Its body is a living furnace, often reaching temperatures of 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, which it uses to incinerate anyone who dares to vandalize the mines it inhabits. Despite its intimidating black, craggy appearance and humanoid shape, Coalossal is generally peaceful until provoked. In competitive lore and Galar-specific battles, it is famously known for its **Gigantamax form**, where it transforms into a colossal, glowing volcano capable of unleashing the devastating G-Max Volcalith, a move that deals continuous damage to non-Rock-type opponents over several turns.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 80, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 90, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Tank / Bulky Mixed Attacker. Its massive HP and Defense allow it to survive heavy physical blows, though its extremely low Speed makes it a prime candidate for Trick Room teams.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a Rock/Fire type, creating significant vulnerabilities. It has a **Double Weakness (4x) to Water** and a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**. It is also weak to Fighting and Rock, while resisting Normal, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, Ice, and Fairy-type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its balanced offensive stats and utility, key moves include **Heat Crash** (which scales with its high 310.5kg weight), **Meteor Beam** (for high special damage and a Sp. Atk boost), **Stealth Rock** (for entry hazard support), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to cripple physical attackers with burns).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Steam Engine:** A signature tactical ability that maximizes Speed (+6 stages) when hit by a Fire or Water-type move, often triggered by a teammate’s Surf or Aqua Jet in doubles.
    * **Flame Body:** Provides a 30% chance to burn opponents that make contact, reinforcing its role as a physical wall.
    * **Flash Fire (Hidden):** Grants immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts its own Fire-type damage when hit by one.

## Evolution & Biology
Coalossal is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Rolycoly**, which evolves into **Carkol** starting at **Level 18**. Carkol then evolves into **Coalossal** starting at **Level 34**. Biologically, it is part of the **Mineral** egg group, and it takes roughly 15 hatch counters to produce an offspring. Its habitat is primarily deep within caves and coal mines where it provides heat for Galar's inhabitants, acting as a historical source of fuel for the region. As it matures, the coal on its back grows into a mountain-like structure that constantly vents intense heat and sparks.
