## Identity & Lore
Mew (Pokedex #151) is the Mythical **New Species Pokémon**, originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Visually, it is a small, pink, bipedal feline with large blue eyes and a long, thin tail. Renowned as a "mirage" by experts due to its extreme rarity, Mew is said to possess the genetic composition of all Pokémon. This unique biology allows it to make itself invisible at will and, most notably, learn almost every Move, TM, and HM in existence. It is widely considered the ancestor of most Pokémon species. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is inextricably linked to the creation of the genetically engineered Legendary, **Mewtwo**.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 100, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 100, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Versatile All-Rounder / Unpredictable Utility.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Psychic** type, Mew is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark** attacks. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Mew's defining trait is its ability to learn nearly any attack, allowing it to target any specific weakness. A distinct set capitalizing on its balanced stats and recovery options includes **Psychic** (STAB), **Soft-Boiled** (for reliable sustain), **Nasty Plot** (to sharply boost Special Attack), and **Aura Sphere** (for coverage against Dark and Steel types). Other notable moves include **Transform**, **Metronome**, and **Stealth Rock**.
*   **Abilities:** **Synchronize** (If the Pokémon is burned, paralyzed, or poisoned by another Pokémon, that Pokémon receives the same status condition).

## Evolution & Biology
Mew is a standalone Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve into or from any other species. Despite its biological significance as the genetic ancestor of Pokémon, it belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** Egg Group and cannot breed in captivity. In the lore of the Kanto region, scientists obtained DNA from Mew to create the clone Pokémon, Mewtwo.
