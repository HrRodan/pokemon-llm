## Identity & Lore
**Pidgey** (Pokedex #016) is the **Tiny Bird Pokémon**, a ubiquitous sight throughout the forests and woods of **Generation I (Kanto)**. Characterized by its brown plumage and docile nature, this **Normal/Flying**-type prefers to avoid conflict. When threatened, it flaps its wings rapidly at ground level to kick up blinding sand—a behavior associated with the move **Sand-Attack**—to distract predators and escape. While it is often the first Pokémon a trainer encounters, its evolutionary line holds significant latent power, as its final form, Pidgeot, is capable of achieving **Mega Evolution** (Mega Pidgeot) using a Pidgeotite.
