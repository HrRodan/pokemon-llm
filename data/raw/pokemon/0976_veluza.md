## Identity & Lore
Veluza (#976) is the Jettison Pokémon, a predatory marine species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This gray, fish-like Pokémon possesses a lean, streamlined body designed for high-speed underwater pursuit. Its most striking biological trait is its ability to shed or "jettison" its own flesh to lighten its weight, a process that hones its mind and significantly amplifies its psychic power. According to Paldean lore and culinary observation, the discarded flesh is noted for having a mild, delicious flavor, often attracting other aquatic predators. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or known Paradox counterpart, Veluza is notorious among trainers for its aggressive behavior in the wild, often charging at travelers with startling velocity in bodies of water like Casseroya Lake.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 102, Defense 73, Sp. Atk 78, Sp. Def 65, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** High-Risk Physical Sweeper. While its base Speed is modest, it is designed to leverage its signature setup move to become a late-game cleaner.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Water/Psychic type, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, Dark, Grass, and Electric**. It **resists Fighting, Steel, Fire, Water, Ice, and Psychic** types.
* **Move Selection:** Veluza excels when utilizing its superior Physical Attack and its signature move. Key maneuvers include **Fillet Away** (which sacrifices HP to sharply boost offensive stats), **Aqua Cutter** (a high-crit slicing move), **Psycho Cut** (a physical Psychic STAB move), and **Aqua Jet** (essential priority to pick off weakened foes).
* **Abilities:** **Mold Breaker** (Allows Veluza to ignore the defensive abilities of opponents, such as Sturdy or Unaware) and **Sharpness** (Hidden Ability; significantly increases the power of "slicing" moves like Aqua Cutter, Psycho Cut, and Night Slash, making it its most competitively viable option).

## Evolution & Biology
Veluza is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. Despite its lack of an evolutionary line, it is a formidable biological specimen that occupies the **Water 2** Egg Group. In breeding cycles, it has a hatch counter of 20, and its growth rate is classified as "Fast," allowing it to reach competitive levels quickly. Its physiology is uniquely adapted to its "Jettison" behavior, allowing it to regenerate the flesh it discards during battle or high-speed maneuvers. It stands at 2.5 meters in length, though its weight of 90.0 kg can fluctuate depending on whether it has recently used its psychic shedding abilities.
