## Identity & Lore
Zigzagoon (Pokédex #263) is the Tiny Raccoon Pokémon, a common sight in the grassy plains of **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Characterized by its bristly brown fur and mask-like facial markings, this Pokémon is infamous for its restless nature; it wanders constantly in zigzag patterns due to its overwhelming curiosity. It investigates everything it sees, often finding lost objects in the grass, a trait reflected in its natural ability to scavenge items. While this profile details the standard Normal-type form, a Dark/Normal regional variant known as **Galarian Zigzagoon** exists in the Galar region, which is more aggressive and known for its rock-and-roll aesthetic.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 38, Attack 30, Defense 41, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 41, Speed 60.
*   **Archetype:** Early-Game Scavenger / Little Cup Belly Drum Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses an **immunity to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** despite its low base stats, Zigzagoon has access to a surprising high-risk setup. Capitalizing on its Speed and Move pool, key moves include **Belly Drum** (maximizes Attack), **Extreme Speed** (high-priority STAB), **Headbutt** (STAB with flinch chance), and **Seed Bomb** (for coverage against Rock/Ground types).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pickup:** The Pokémon may pick up items like Potions or Rare Candies after battle, highly useful for adventure utility.
    *   **Gluttony:** Encourages the Pokémon to eat a held Berry at 50% HP instead of 25%, often paired with Belly Drum strategies.
    *   **Quick Feet (Hidden):** Boosts Speed by 50% if the Pokémon is afflicted with a status condition.

## Evolution & Biology
Zigzagoon belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and initiates a 2-stage evolutionary line in its Hoenn form. It evolves into **Linoone** upon reaching **Level 20**. While the input data notes a further evolution into **Obstagoon**, it is important to distinguish that **only the Galarian Linoone** is capable of evolving into Obstagoon; the standard Hoenn Linoone does not evolve further. In the wild, Zigzagoon is frequently found holding survival items such as a **Potion**, **Revive**, or **Oran Berry**, reinforcing its reputation as a scavenger.
