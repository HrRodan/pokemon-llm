## Identity & Lore
Sandaconda (Pokedex #844) is the Sand Snake Pokémon, a desert-dwelling reptile originally discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Its most striking physical feature is the large, inflated pouch around its neck which stores dry sand. This sand is its primary weapon; by contracting its muscular body, it can spray over 220 pounds of grit from its nose with enough pressure to pierce through stone. Lore suggests that Sandaconda is deeply psychologically dependent on its reserves, becoming visibly disheartened and vulnerable if it ever runs out of sand. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, Sandaconda possesses a unique **Gigantamax form**, where it stands tall like a massive, coiled whirlwind, using its sand-filled body to crush opponents and generate the G-Max move *G-Max Sandblast*.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Attacker.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sand Spit:** A signature ability that automatically summons a Sandstorm when the Pokémon is hit by an attack, providing immediate chip damage and weather control.
    * **Shed Skin:** Provides a 33% chance each turn to cure the Pokémon of any non-volatile status condition (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep), increasing its longevity.
    * **Sand Veil (Hidden):** Increases the Pokémon's evasion during a sandstorm, making it harder for opponents to land hits.

## Evolution & Biology
Sandaconda is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Silicobra** once it reaches **Level 36**. Biologically, it is a hardy species capable of surviving in the harshest arid climates. It belongs to both the **Ground** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, reflecting its reptilian heritage and its ability to learn powerful draconic moves like *Outrage* and *Scale Shot*. With a hatch counter of 20, it requires a moderate amount of effort for breeders to produce offspring, which begin their lives as the smaller, more timid Silicobra before developing their signature sand-spraying sacs.
