## Identity & Lore
Floette (Pokedex #670) is the Single Bloom Pokémon, a species deeply entwined with the floral ecology of the Kalos region (Generation VI). This delicate creature flutters through meadows and flower beds, searching for wilting blossoms to revitalize using its internal life force. It is famously recognized by the flower it carries, which comes in five distinct colors: **Red, Yellow, Orange, Blue, and White**. These flowers are not merely accessories but are treated as part of the Pokémon's own body. 

While not appearing in the provided data, ancient legends in the Kalos region speak of a unique "Eternal Flower" Floette associated with the character AZ, which possesses the exclusive move Light of Ruin. Floette is known to be a nurturing spirit, but it can unleash devastating mystical power if the gardens it protects are threatened.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 54, Attack 45, Defense 47, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 98, Speed 52.
* **Archetype:** Specially Defensive Eviolite Support. Due to its status as a middle-evolution, it is frequently used with the Eviolite item to bolster its defenses.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison and Steel**. It **resists Fighting, Bug, and Dark**, and possesses a total **immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack and its symbiotic relationship with nature, key moves include **Moonblast** (high-damage Fairy STAB), **Dazzling Gleam** (multi-target offense), **Energy Ball** (Grass-type coverage), and **Psychic** (to counter Poison-type weaknesses). It also utilizes utility moves like **Wish** and **Aromatherapy** to support the team.
* **Abilities:** **Flower Veil** prevents the stats of ally Grass-type Pokémon from being lowered and protects them from non-volatile status conditions. **Symbiosis** (Hidden Ability) allows Floette to pass its held item to an ally immediately after that ally consumes their own item in battle.

## Evolution & Biology
Floette is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Flabébé** once it reaches **Level 19**. To trigger its final evolution into **Florges**, Floette must be exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. Unlike many other species, its appearance (specifically the color of its flower) is determined by the flower it chose as a Flabébé and persists through its entire evolutionary journey. 

It belongs to the **Fairy Egg Group** and has a hatch counter of 20, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive use. Biologically, it is a female-only species, often found in habitats rich with flora where it acts as a spectral gardener.
