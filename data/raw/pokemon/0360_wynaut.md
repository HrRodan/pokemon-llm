## Identity & Lore
Wynaut (Pokedex #360) is the Bright Pokémon, a pure Psychic-type introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Characterized by its bright blue body and a perpetual, enthusiastic smile, this Baby Pokémon is deceptive in appearance. Lore suggests that Wynaut uses its cute demeanor to distract predators while its black, eye-spotted tail—which is believed to hold its true sentience or sensitivity—remains protected. It is often found clustering in caves to sleep or practice counter-attacks with others of its kind. When angered or threatened, it will slap the ground with its tail.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 23, Defense 48, Sp. Atk 23, Sp. Def 48, Speed 23.
*   **Archetype:** Passive Trapper / Counter-Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark** and **resists Fighting and Psychic**.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its abysmal offensive stats, Wynaut relies entirely on reaction damage and disruption. Its optimal kit includes **Counter** (to return physical damage double) and **Mirror Coat** (to return special damage double). Utility is provided by **Encore** (to lock opponents into setup moves) and **Destiny Bond** (to force a mutual knockout).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Shadow Tag:** Prevents the opponent from fleeing or switching out. This is Wynaut's primary competitive niche, allowing it to trap and eliminate specific threats.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden):** Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it, preventing friendly fire in double battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Wynaut is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Wobbuffet** starting at **Level 15**. As a designated Baby Pokémon, it belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group and cannot breed itself. To produce a Wynaut Egg, a parent Wobbuffet is typically required to hold a **Lax Incense** during the breeding process; otherwise, a Wobbuffet will be hatched instead.
