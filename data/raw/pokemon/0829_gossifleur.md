## Identity & Lore
Gossifleur (Pokedex #829) is the Flowering Pokémon, a delicate Grass-type species first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It is easily identified by its vibrant red petals and yellow center, resembling a blooming flower. This Pokémon is famously known for its unique biology; it anchors its single, needle-like leg into the earth to bask in the sunlight. Once it has absorbed a sufficient amount of solar energy, its petals unfurl into a brilliant bloom. In Galarian culture, the pollen produced by Gossifleur is highly prized for its medicinal properties, often used in folk remedies to treat illnesses. While Gossifleur does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form itself, its evolved form, Eldegoss, is a staple of the Galar League, famously utilized by the Turffield Gym Leader, Milo.

## Evolution & Biology
Gossifleur is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Eldegoss** starting at **Level 20**. Biologically, Gossifleur travels by riding the wind; when caught in a strong breeze, it can spin its petals to control its flight path and travel great distances across the Galar region's rolling hills. It belongs to the **Grass** (Plant) Egg Group and is known for its relatively fast development, with a hatch counter of 20. Its growth is heavily dependent on the quality of the soil and the amount of direct sunlight it receives during its anchored state.
