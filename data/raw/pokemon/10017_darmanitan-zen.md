## Identity & Lore
Darmanitan (Zen Mode) (Pokedex #10017) is the Blazing Pokémon, a unique psychological and physical transformation of the standard Darmanitan first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. In this state, its body hardens into a stone-like form, and its internal fire, which usually burns at 2,500° F with enough power to destroy a dump truck with a single punch, is calmed and turned inward to sharpen its mental prowess. While the standard form is known for its red, rambunctious appearance and physical ferocity, the Zen Mode Darmanitan is a dual Fire/Psychic type that resembles a meditative statue. Beyond this Unovian variant, Darmanitan is also known to possess a Galarian Form in the Galar region, which transitions from an Ice-type to a dual Ice/Fire-type in its own distinct Zen Mode.

* **Abilities:** Zen Mode (Hidden Ability): This is the defining trait of this form, causing Darmanitan to change from its Standard Mode to its Zen Mode when its HP drops below half. Sheer Force (Standard): Removes secondary effects from moves to increase their raw damage by 30%, which is highly effective for its Fire-type attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Darmanitan is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Darumaka starting at Level 35. While the standard Unovian Darumaka evolves into the Fire-type Darmanitan, the Galarian variant uses an Ice Stone to evolve into Galarian Darmanitan. Accessing the Zen Mode form specifically requires the Pokémon to possess its Hidden Ability. Biologically, Darmanitan belongs to the Ground Egg Group. Despite its stone-like appearance in Zen Mode, it remains a biological powerhouse that sustains its life force through intense internal heat, often found in desert environments or ancient ruins where it can meditate undisturbed.
