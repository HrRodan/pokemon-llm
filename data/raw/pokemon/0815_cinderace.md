## Identity & Lore
Cinderace (Pokedex #815) is the Striker Pokémon, a formidable and athletic bipedal Fire-type introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region). Known for its incredible footwork and competitive spirit, Cinderace juggles pebbles with its feet to transform them into searing, burning soccer balls that can scorch opponents upon impact. Its white, red, and navy plumage resembles a professional athlete's kit, reflecting its role as the final evolution of the Galar Fire-type starter, Scorbunny. In the Galar region, Cinderace is celebrated for its offensive prowess and is one of the few Pokémon capable of achieving a **Gigantamax form**, where it stands atop a massive flaming ball with a sentient face, known as G-Max Fireball. Its behavior is characterized by showing off its acrobatic skills, often performing elaborate victory celebrations after a successful strike.

## Evolution & Biology
Cinderace is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Scorbunny**, the Fire-type starter of the Galar region. Scorbunny evolves into **Raboot** starting at Level 16, which adopts a more withdrawn, "teenager-like" persona. Finally, Raboot evolves into **Cinderace** starting at Level 35, regaining its energetic and outgoing personality. Biologically, Cinderace belongs to the **Ground (Field)** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups. It has a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively standard breed for competitive training. Its physiology is optimized for long-distance running and explosive kicking power, supported by its "upright" shape and lean 33.0 kg frame.
