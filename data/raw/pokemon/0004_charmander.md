## Identity & Lore
Charmander (Pokedex #004) is the Lizard Pokémon, a celebrated Fire-type starter originating from **Generation I (Kanto)**. This bipedal, red reptilian is predominantly found in **mountainous** habitats and obviously prefers hot places. Its most iconic characteristic is the flame burning at the tip of its tail, which serves as a barometer for its health and emotions; steam is said to spout from the tip when it rains, and if the flame goes out, the Pokémon's life force is extinguished. While a basic stage Pokémon, Charmander possesses immense evolutionary potential, maturing into the powerful Charizard, which is capable of two distinct **Mega Evolutions** (Mega Charizard X and Y) and a **Gigantamax** form.
