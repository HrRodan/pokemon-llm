## Identity & Lore
Gulpin (Pokedex #316) is the Stomach Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Generation III (Hoenn)** region. This green, amorphous creature resides primarily in grasslands. True to its genus, virtually all of Gulpin's body is its stomach; its heart and brain are diminutive in comparison. This unique physiology allows it to swallow objects or prey equal to its own size whole. Inside, its stomach contains a highly potent fluid capable of digesting almost anything instantly. While it appears sluggish, it is a gluttonous entity driven entirely by its appetite.
