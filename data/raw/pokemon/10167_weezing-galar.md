## Identity & Lore
Galarian Weezing (Pokedex #10167) is the Poison Gas Pokémon, a unique regional variant first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. Standing at three meters tall, this form is distinguished by its long, chimney-like top hats and smog-formed facial hair, reflecting the industrial history of Galar. While the species originates from Generation I (Kanto), the Galarian form adapted to consume polluted air, expelling clean, purified air from the tops of its heads. Unlike the standard purple variant, Galarian Weezing features a refined gray coloration. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form itself, it is frequently associated with the industrial landscapes where Galar’s massive energy factories operate.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Weezing is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Koffing** starting at **Level 35** specifically when leveled up within the Galar region. This metamorphosis occurs as two Koffing fuse over many years, though in Galar, the process is influenced by the consumption of industrial waste gases. Biologically, it belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group. Its unique physiology allows it to act as a living filtration system, making it one of the few Poison-type Pokémon that actively improves the environmental health of urban habitats.
