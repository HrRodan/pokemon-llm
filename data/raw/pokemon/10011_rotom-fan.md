## Identity & Lore
Rotom-Fan (Pokedex #10011) is the Plasma Pokémon, a unique form of the Gen IV Sinnoh-native Pokémon, Rotom, created when the spirit-like entity inhabits an electric fan. First discovered in the Sinnoh region, this Electric/Flying-type variant is characterized by its orange, plasma-infused body and its ability to manipulate wind. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is one of five specialized appliance forms alongside Rotom-Wash, Rotom-Heat, Rotom-Mow, and Rotom-Frost. Lore states that Rotom’s body is composed of plasma and that it thrives by infiltrating electronic devices to play pranks or wreak havoc. In its Fan Form, it uses its motorized rotors to generate powerful gusts of air, often surprising trainers with its high defensive utility compared to its mischievous base form.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 65, Defense 107, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 107, Speed 86.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Pivot. With significantly higher base defensive stats than the standard Rotom form, Rotom-Fan excels as a durable switch-in that can threaten opponents with special attacks.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock and Ice**. It **resists Grass, Fighting, Bug, Steel, and Flying**. Notably, it is completely **immune to Ground-type moves**, though this is famously redundant as both its Flying-typing and its ability grant this immunity.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Special Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Air Slash** (high-flinch STAB), **Thunderbolt** (consistent damage), **Volt Switch** (to maintain momentum), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to cripple physical attackers) or **Nasty Plot** (for offensive sweeping).
* **Abilities:** Levitate (Provides full immunity to Ground-type moves and hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes). While redundant on a Flying-type, it ensures Rotom-Fan remains untouched by the earth even if its typing is changed or suppressed.

## Evolution & Biology
Rotom-Fan is part of a single-stage evolutionary line, but it possesses the unique biological ability to undergo **Forme Change**. It does not evolve through leveling; instead, a base Rotom transforms into Rotom-Fan when it interacts with an electric fan, typically via the **Rotom Catalog** or in specific locations like Charon's Room in Sinnoh or the Department Store in Kalos. This transformation alters its base stats and replaces its secondary Ghost-typing with the Flying-type. It belongs to the **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** Egg Group and is known for its relatively low hatch rate (20 cycles), making it a prized specimen for competitive breeding. It is genderless, mirroring its spectral and electrical nature.
