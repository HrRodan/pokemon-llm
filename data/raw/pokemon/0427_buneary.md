## Identity & Lore
Buneary (Pokedex #427) is the Normal-type Rabbit Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Recognized by its fluffy, brown fur and curled ears, this upright Pokémon possesses a surprising amount of physical strength. It utilizes its rolled-up ears as powerful springs to slam foes, striking with enough force to make an adult cry in pain. Uniquely, Buneary starts with a **Base Happiness of 0**, implying a naturally wary or distrustful nature towards Trainers upon capture. While it does not change forms itself, its evolutionary successor, Lopunny, is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** in capable hands.

## Evolution & Biology
