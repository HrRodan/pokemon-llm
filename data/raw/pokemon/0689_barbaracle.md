## Identity & Lore
Barbaracle (Pokedex #689) is the Collective Pokémon, a fascinating biological oddity introduced in the Kalos region (Generation VI). As a dual Rock and Water-type, its physical form is a brown, bipedal organism composed of seven distinct Binacle that have fused together into a single, coordinated entity. While the head possesses its own brain, each of its limbs—including the four that make up its arms and the two that serve as its legs—thinks and moves independently, yet they cooperate with terrifying efficiency in battle. According to lore, these seven components fight with the combined power of seven individual Binacle. While Barbaracle does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its "Collective" nature makes it one of the most physically complex organisms in the Pokémon world.

* **Move Selection:** Barbaracle excels when utilizing its high Attack and contact-based moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Barbaracle is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Binacle** starting at **Level 39**. This metamorphosis represents a transition from two organisms sharing a single rock to a complex colony of seven acting as a single warrior. Biologically, it is part of the **Water 3** Egg Group, and with a Hatch Counter of 20, it requires a moderate amount of effort for breeders to produce. Its predatory nature and reliance on its "hands" for both locomotion and offense make it a dominant presence in coastal and rocky environments.
