## Identity & Lore
Smoochum (Pokedex #238) is the **Kiss Pokémon**, a small, pink, humanoid creature introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. As a **Baby Pokémon**, it is often found in urban habitats and is defined by the unique sensory biology of its lips. These lips are the most sensitive part of its body, functioning as its primary sensory organ; Smoochum will always kiss or press its lips against objects to examine them before using its hands. While it appears harmless, it possesses latent psychic potential that fully manifests upon evolution.

*   **Archetype:** Little Cup Special Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As an **Ice/Psychic** type, it has numerous vulnerabilities. It is **weak to Rock, Steel, Fire, Bug, Ghost, and Dark** type moves. However, it **resists Ice and Psychic** attacks. Notably, its Psychic typing neutralizes the standard Ice weakness to Fighting-type damage.

It also has access to the utility move **Lovely Kiss** to induce sleep.

    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming infatuated or falling for taunts, ensuring it can use status moves like Nasty Plot uninterrupted.
    *   **Forewarn:** Reveals the opponent's move with the highest base power upon entering battle.
    *   **Hydration (Hidden):** Heals all status conditions at the end of the turn if it is raining.

## Evolution & Biology
Smoochum is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Jynx** starting at **Level 30**. As a Baby Pokémon, Smoochum belongs to the **No Eggs** group and cannot breed; however, it is obtained by breeding a female Jynx (Human-Like Egg Group). Known for its energetic nature, Smoochum constantly checks its reflection to ensure its face is clean, particularly after eating.
