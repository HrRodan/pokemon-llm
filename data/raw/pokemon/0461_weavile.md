## Identity & Lore
Weavile (Pokedex #461) is the Sharp Claw Pokémon, a cunning Dark/Ice-type predator introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its black fur, red crown-like feathers, and razor-sharp claws, Weavile is highly intelligent and devious. These Pokémon inhabit cold, snowy regions where they form coordinated packs of four or five to hunt prey with tactical precision, often communicating by carving symbols into trees and ice. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares a pre-evolution with the Hisuian native, Sneasler, representing a divergent evolutionary path adapted to the modern era.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 120, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 85, Speed 125.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** Weavile suffers from a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting-type** moves. It is also weak to Rock, Steel, Fire, Bug, and Fairy. However, it **resists Ghost, Dark, and Ice**, and possesses a total **immunity to Psychic-type** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its blistering Speed and high Attack, Weavile functions best with moves like **Knock Off** (for utility and STAB damage), **Triple Axel** or **Ice Spinner** (primary Ice STAB), **Ice Shard** (priority for revenge killing), and **Low Kick** (coverage against heavy Rock or Steel types). **Swords Dance** is often used to further boost its offensive pressure.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** When hit by an attack, the attacker uses 2 PP instead of 1.
    *   **Pickpocket (Hidden Ability):** The Pokémon steals the held item of an attacker that makes direct contact.

## Evolution & Biology
Weavile is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sneasel** when leveled up at **night** while holding a **Razor Claw**. Interestingly, the Sneasel line has a divergent evolution; if a Sneasel is leveled up during the **day** while holding a Razor Claw, it evolves into Sneasler (Hisuian form), rather than Weavile. It belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group and has a base happiness of 35, lower than the standard 70, reflecting its solitary and vicious nature.
