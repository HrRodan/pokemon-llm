## Identity & Lore
Dusknoir (Pokedex #477) is the Gripper Pokémon, a formidable Ghost-type entity first discovered in the **Generation IV (Sinnoh)** region. This imposing, black-colored specter acts as a conduit between the living world and the afterlife. According to research, the antenna on its head captures special radio waves from the spirit world, commanding it to guide people to the afterlife. It possesses a mouth on its belly which is said to swallow its targets whole, though it reportedly only consumes spirits rather than physical bodies. Dusknoir is the final evolution of the Duskull line and is often associated with the Grim Reaper due to its role in shepherding lost souls.

## Evolution & Biology
Dusknoir is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the **Amorphous** Egg Group. It evolves from **Dusclops** when **traded while holding a Reaper Cloth**. The line begins with Duskull, which evolves into Dusclops starting at **Level 37**. The use of the Reaper Cloth during the trade process is the specific catalyst required to bind the spirit into this advanced physical form.
