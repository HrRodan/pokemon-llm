## Identity & Lore
Hariyama (Pokedex #297) is the massive Arm Thrust Pokémon, a pure Fighting-type introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a high-ranking sumo wrestler, this colossal humanoid Pokémon inhabits mountainous regions where it challenges anything it sees to tests of strength. Its lower body is exceedingly stable, allowing it to withstand immense impact without budging, while its open-handed strikes are powerful enough to send trucks flying. Lore suggests Hariyama is capable of standing on train tracks and stopping a moving train using only its forearm thrusts. In Generation IX (Paldea), a futuristic Paradox Pokémon known as **Iron Hands** was discovered, which shares a near-identical physical build to Hariyama but with a robotic composition and Electric/Fighting typing.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 144, Attack 120, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 60, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker / Trick Room Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** With a massive Attack stat and low Speed, Hariyama excels with high-power physical moves and priority utility. Key moves include **Close Combat** (high STAB damage), **Knock Off** (crippling utility against Psychic/Ghost types), **Heavy Slam** (utilizing its 253.8kg weight), and **Drain Punch** (sustainability). It is also a premier user of **Fake Out** for immediate pressure.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Thick Fat:** Halves the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves, granting Hariyama pseudo-resistances to these common offensive types.
    *   **Guts:** Increases Attack by 50% when afflicted by a status condition (Burn, Paralyze, Poison), making it a dangerous wall-breaker when holding a Flame Orb.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden):** Increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, but removes those effects.

## Evolution & Biology
Hariyama is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Makuhita** starting at **Level 24**. In the wild, it may occasionally be found holding a **King's Rock**. It belongs to the **Human-Like** Egg Group. Its growth rate is initially fast but becomes very slow as it reaches higher levels, reflecting the discipline required for a sumo wrestler to reach the rank of Yokozuna.
