## Identity & Lore
Aegislash-Blade (Pokedex #10026) is the Royal Sword Pokémon, a formidable Steel and Ghost-type entity that first appeared in the Kalos region during Generation VI. In its Blade Forme, Aegislash unsheathes itself, exposing its blade to unleash devastating spectral power. Historical records indicate that generations of kings were attended by these Pokémon; it is said they used their innate supernatural abilities to manipulate and control the minds of both humans and other Pokémon to build entire kingdoms. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique physiological ability to transition between defensive and offensive stances makes it one of the most mechanically complex Pokémon in existence. Its sleek, blade-like body is primarily a metallic brown, radiating an aura of ancient, regal authority.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 140, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 140, Sp. Def 50, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Glass Cannon. In this specific Forme, Aegislash sacrifices all of its defensive integrity to maximize its offensive presence.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark**. Conversely, it boasts an incredible defensive profile, **resisting Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**, with a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**. It is completely **immune to Poison, Normal, and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Aegislash excels as a mixed attacker, utilizing its equalized offensive stats. Key moves include **Shadow Ball** and **Flash Cannon** for high-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) special damage, while **Sacred Sword** provides perfect coverage against Steel-type mirrors. **King's Shield** is its essential signature move, allowing it to revert to Shield Forme and protect itself while lowering the opponent's Attack.
* **Abilities:** Stance Change (The Pokémon changes its form to Blade Forme when it uses an attacking move, and changes to Shield Forme when it uses the move King's Shield). This ability is the core of its competitive viability, allowing it to tank hits in its shield state and retaliate with its massive 140-base offensive stats.

## Evolution & Biology
Aegislash is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Honedge**, a sentient sword that inhabits abandoned armories. Honedge evolves into the dual-wielding **Doublade** starting at Level 35. To reach its final regal form as **Aegislash**, a Doublade must be exposed to the radiation of a **Dusk Stone**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and is often found in areas with high historical or spiritual significance. Despite its inanimate appearance, it is a highly intelligent hunter that can sense the leadership qualities of humans, supposedly choosing which kings to serve based on their worthiness.
