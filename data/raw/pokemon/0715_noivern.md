## Identity & Lore
Noivern (Pokedex #715) is the Sound Wave Pokémon, a dual-type Flying and Dragon creature first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This draconic predator is distinguished by its massive, speaker-like ears which emit ultrasonic waves strong enough to shatter large boulders. Known for its cruel and aggressive temperament, Noivern is a nocturnal hunter that thrives in the dark; it flies through moonless nights with unparalleled agility, striking at careless prey before they even register its presence. While it is notoriously difficult to tame, it is known to become quite docile if offered its favorite ripe fruit. Although it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Noivern occupies a unique niche as one of the fastest non-legendary Dragon-types in existence, often compared to the "Pseudo-Legendary" class due to its late evolution and high power ceiling.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 70, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 97, Sp. Def 80, Speed 123.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Offensive Pivot. Its elite Speed tier allows it to outpace the majority of the unboosted metagame, serving as an effective revenge killer or scout.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, Fairy, and Dragon**, and suffers from a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. Conversely, it **resists Fighting, Fire, Water, Grass (0.25x), and Bug**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and Speed, Noivern’s optimal kit includes **Boomburst** (a devastating 140-power sound move that bypasses substitutes), **Draco Meteor** (for maximum burst damage), **Hurricane** (its strongest Flying STAB, especially in rain), and **Flamethrower** (to melt the Ice and Steel types that otherwise threaten it). For utility, it often utilizes **Roost** for longevity or **U-turn** for momentum.
* **Abilities:** **Frisk** (identifies the opponent’s held item upon entry, providing crucial tactical intel); **Infiltrator** (allows Noivern to bypass the effects of Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, and Substitute); **Telepathy** (Hidden Ability; prevents the Pokémon from taking damage from its allies' moves in Double Battles).

## Evolution & Biology
Noivern is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Noibat** once it reaches **Level 48**, making it a Pokémon that requires significant patience and training to reach its full potential. Biologically, it is a member of both the **Flying** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. Its purple and black coloration serves as natural camouflage for night hunting, and its wing membranes are specifically designed for high-speed maneuvers. It has a hatch counter of 20, indicating it takes a moderate amount of time to breed and hatch in a competitive setting.
