## Identity & Lore
Carracosta (Pokedex #565) is the Prototurtle Pokémon, a formidable prehistoric species resurrected from the Cover Fossil. Originally appearing in the Unova region during Generation V, this blue, bipedal turtle is renowned for its incredible physical power; a single slap from its thick, flipper-like arms is powerful enough to punch holes through the hulls of massive tankers. Its biology allows it to thrive both deep within the ocean and on land in search of prey. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Carracosta is considered a premier "Fossil Pokémon," sharing a lineage with other ancient marine dwellers. Its body is encased in a shell as hard as steel, reflecting its dual-type nature and its ancient origins as a predator that hunted nearly 100 million years ago.

* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high physical Attack and access to the best setup move in the game, Carracosta’s optimal kit includes **Shell Smash** (to double its offensive presence), **Stone Edge** (high-damage STAB), **Liquidation** (consistent Water STAB), and **Aqua Jet** (essential priority to bypass its low base Speed).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Solid Rock:** Reduces the damage taken from super-effective moves by 25%, significantly increasing its survivability against its many weaknesses.
    * **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full HP, allowing it a guaranteed turn to use Shell Smash.
    * **Swift Swim (Hidden Ability):** Doubles its Speed during rain, turning this slow tank into a terrifying rain-team sweeper.

## Evolution & Biology
Carracosta is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Tirtouga** once it reaches **Level 37**. As an ancient species, it is biologically related to other shelled aquatic creatures and belongs to the **Water 1 and Water 3** Egg Groups. Its heavy frame—weighing 81.0kg—and upright posture indicate a transition from a purely aquatic lifestyle to one that could dominate coastal environments. In competitive breeding, its hatch counter of 30 suggests a moderate investment is required to produce high-IV specimens.
