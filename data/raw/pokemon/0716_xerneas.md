## Identity & Lore
Xerneas (Pokedex #716) is the legendary Life Pokémon, representing the forces of creation and longevity within the Kalos region of Generation VI. Standing as a majestic, cervine figure with sprawling, multi-colored antlers, it is the polar opposite of Yveltal, the Pokémon of destruction. According to Kalosian myth, Xerneas has the power to bestow eternal life; when it nears the end of its natural lifespan, it releases all its remaining energy into the surrounding land before transforming into a dormant, crystalline tree to sleep for a thousand years. It exists in two distinct states: its "Neutral Mode," seen while at rest, and its "Active Mode," which it assumes during battle as its antlers glow with prismatic light. While Xerneas does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a core member of the "Aura Trio" alongside Yveltal and Zygarde.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 126, Attack 131, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 131, Sp. Def 98, Speed 99.
* **Archetype:** Set-up Special Sweeper. While its Attack and Special Attack are identical, Xerneas is defined by its access to the most powerful set-up move in the game, making it a premier special threat in competitive "Ubers" tiers.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fairy-type, it is **weak to Poison and Steel**. It **resists Fighting, Bug, and Dark** and possesses a complete **immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** To maximize its devastating offensive potential, Xerneas typically utilizes **Geomancy** (its signature move to double Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed in one turn when paired with a Power Herb), **Moonblast** (boosted by STAB and its ability), **Focus Blast** (to cover Steel-type checks), and **Thunderbolt** or **Psyshock** (to handle bulky Flying or Poison types).
* **Abilities:** Fairy Aura (Increases the power of Fairy-type moves for all Pokémon on the field by 33.3%. This turns Xerneas's STAB attacks into world-ending strikes).

## Evolution & Biology
Xerneas is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of any evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species. As a member of the "No-Eggs" group, it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is deeply tied to the ecosystem; it is said that the energy it radiates can revive wilted forests and grant vitality to living beings. In the wild of the Kalos region, it serves as a guardian of life, though it spent centuries in a dormant state following the ancient Kalos war 3,000 years ago. Its massive 3.0-meter height and 215.0-kg weight emphasize its presence as a literal "force of nature" on the battlefield.
