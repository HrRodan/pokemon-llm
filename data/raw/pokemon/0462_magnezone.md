## Identity & Lore
Magnezone (Pokedex #462) is the Magnet Area Pokémon, a formidable construct introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A direct evolution of Magneton, it is the result of three units generating magnetism to fuse together, often triggered by exposure to special magnetic fields found in specific regions like Mt. Coronet or Chargestone Cave. Resembling a mechanical UFO, Magnezone utilizes anti-gravity to float through the air, flashing its three eyes to communicate with others of its kind. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares a thematic and biological lineage with the Paradox Pokémon **Sandy Shocks** found in Paldea’s Area Zero.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 70, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 130, Sp. Def 90, Speed 60.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Attacker / Steel Trapper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As an Electric/Steel type, it possesses a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground** moves and is weak to Fire and Fighting. However, it offers arguably the best defensive profile in the game, resisting Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Steel, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy types, while being completely **immune to Poison**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 130 Special Attack and high Defense, key moves include **Thunderbolt** (reliable STAB), **Flash Cannon** (Steel STAB), **Volt Switch** (for pivoting out of unfavorable matchups), and **Body Press** (which calculates damage using its high Defense stat rather than its lower Attack).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Magnet Pull:** Prevents opposing Steel-type Pokémon from switching out, defining Magnezone's competitive role as a "Steel Trapper."
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last, synergizing well with Magnezone's lower Speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Magnezone is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Magneton** either when exposed to a **Thunder Stone** or when leveled up in areas with strong magnetic fields, such as **Mt. Coronet**, **Chargestone Cave**, or **Vast Poni Canyon**. It originates from **Magnemite** and belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group. Uniquely, Magnezone is genderless and typically carries a Metal Coat in the wild to boost its Steel-type attacks.
