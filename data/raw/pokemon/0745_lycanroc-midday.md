## Identity & Lore
Midday Lycanroc (Pokedex #745) is the Wolf Pokémon, a loyal and swift canine predator first discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. This specific form is characterized by its light brown fur and the sharp, jagged rocks embedded in its mane, which it uses as lethal weapons to slash at opponents. Unlike its Midnight counterpart, the Midday Form is a quadruped known for its calm temperament and incredible speed, which it uses to confuse enemies before they can react. While Lycanroc does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famous for its biological versatility; the species branches into three distinct forms—Midday, Midnight, and the rare Dusk Form—depending on the time of day and the specific temperament of the Rockruff from which it evolves. In the Alola region, it is often seen roaming rocky terrain and coastal areas, utilizing its heightened senses to track prey across the islands.

## Evolution & Biology
Lycanroc is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rockruff** starting at **Level 25**, specifically during the **daytime**. The biological outcome of this evolution is highly sensitive to solar and lunar energy, resulting in the Midday form when exposed to strong sunlight. Lycanroc belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and is known for a relatively quick development cycle, indicated by a hatch counter of 15. Physically, its 25.0kg weight and 0.8m height make it a lean, agile hunter, perfectly adapted for the rugged, mountainous terrain of Alolan islands like Akala or Poni. In the wild, its biology is centered around its claws and the "stone mane" which can cause deep lacerations to any creature that gets too close.
