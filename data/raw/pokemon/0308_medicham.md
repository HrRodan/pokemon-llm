## Identity & Lore
Medicham (Pokedex #308) is the Meditate Pokémon, a dual-type Fighting/Psychic creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in mountainous habitats, this distinct red-hued Pokémon is known for its rigorous mental and physical discipline. Through deep meditation, Medicham heightens the energy inside its body to sharpen its sixth sense, allowing it to detect aura and movement with precision. It is capable of hiding its presence completely by merging its energy with the surrounding fields and mountains. While powerful in its standard state, Medicham is notably capable of transcending its limits through **Mega Evolution**, transforming into Mega Medicham when holding the Medichamite.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 75, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Glass Cannon. Despite a deceptively low base Attack stat, its specific Ability makes it one of the hardest-hitting physical attackers in the ecosystem.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Ghost, and Fairy** types. It **resists Fighting and Rock** attacks. Due to the interaction of its dual typing, it takes neutral damage from Bug and Dark types (which usually threaten Psychic types).
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Ability-boosted physical strength, key moves include **High Jump Kick** (a high-risk, high-reward STAB move), **Zen Headbutt** (Psychic STAB), **Ice Punch** (essential coverage against Flying and Ground types), and **Recover** (for longevity). Other notable options include **Close Combat** and **Drain Punch**.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pure Power:** Doubles the Pokémon's Attack stat. This is the cornerstone of Medicham's viability, converting a mediocre offensive stat into a massive threat.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden Ability):** Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it, preventing friendly fire in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Medicham is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Meditite** when it reaches **Level 37**. It belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group and has a medium growth rate. Its humanoid physiology allows it to master advanced martial arts techniques and elemental punches which it combines with its psychokinetic powers.
