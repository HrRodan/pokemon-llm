## Identity & Lore
Torterra (Pokedex #389) is the Continent Pokémon, the final evolutionary stage of the Grass-type starter introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. A massive, quadrupedal entity, Torterra resembles a gargantuan tortoise with a fully developed ecosystem on its back, featuring a large oak-like tree and three mountain-like peaks protruding from its shell. Its biology is so substantial that small Pokémon are known to gather on its unmoving back to build nests, effectively treating Torterra as a mobile habitat. Despite its immense weight of 310.0 kg, it shares a deep connection with the earth, often mistaken for a moving forest.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 109, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 85, Speed 56.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a unique **Grass/Ground** type, Torterra possesses a specific defensive profile. It is immune to **Electric** attacks and resists **Ground** and **Rock**. However, it suffers from a debilitating **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**, and standard weaknesses to **Fire, Flying, and Bug**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack stat and access to powerful setup moves, the optimal move set includes **Wood Hammer** (high-power Grass STAB), **Earthquake** (reliable Ground STAB), **Stone Edge** (coverage against Flying/Ice types), and **Shell Smash** (to sharply boost its offensive stats and speed). Alternatively, **Synthesis** provides longevity for tank builds.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Overgrow:** Powers up Grass-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Shell Armor (Hidden Ability):** Protects the Pokémon from critical hits, reinforcing its role as a reliable physical tank that cannot be bypassed by luck.

## Evolution & Biology
Torterra is the final form of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Grotle** starting at **Level 32**, which itself evolves from the starter Pokémon **Turtwig** at **Level 18**. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Plant** Egg Groups, allowing for diverse breeding chains.
