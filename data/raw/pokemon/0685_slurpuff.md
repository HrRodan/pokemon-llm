## Identity & Lore
Slurpuff (#685) is the Meringue Pokémon, a delightful and dessert-like Fairy-type creature first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Its appearance is heavily inspired by sweets, featuring white, puffy fur reminiscent of whipped cream and a red, cherry-like nose. Slurpuff possesses an incredible sense of smell—purported to be 100 million times more sensitive than a human's—allowing it to distinguish the faintest of scents in the air. This biological trait makes it a valuable companion for pastry chefs, as it can detect the subtle nuances of ingredients and the precise moment a confection is perfectly baked. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its unique role as a specialized sensory tracker and its association with the culinary arts of Kalos make it a culturally significant species.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 82, Attack 80, Defense 86, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 75, Speed 72.
* **Archetype:** Versatile Setup Sweeper / Utility Lead.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fairy-type, it is **weak to Poison and Steel**. It effectively **resists Fighting, Bug, and Dark** types, and it possesses a total **Immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Slurpuff features surprisingly diverse coverage and utility. Capitalizing on its slightly higher Special Attack and its role as a disruptor, key moves include **Dazzling Gleam** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Flamethrower** to melt through Steel-type threats, **Surf** for varied elemental coverage, and **Sticky Web** to provide crucial entry hazard support by slowing down the opposing team.
* **Abilities:** **Sweet Veil** prevents Slurpuff and its allies from falling asleep, making it a hard counter to "Spore" or "Sleep Powder" strategies. Its Hidden Ability, **Unburden**, is its most competitive asset; it doubles Slurpuff's Speed stat immediately after its held item is consumed or lost, allowing it to outpace almost the entire unboosted metagame.

## Evolution & Biology
Slurpuff is the second and final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Swirlix** only when the pre-evolution is **traded while holding a Whipped Dream**—an item saturated with the sweet scents it craves. Biologically, Slurpuff is a humanoid-shaped creature that stores air in its fur to stay light and fluffy. It belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its status as a relatively common but specialized species. Its medium growth rate and balanced defensive stats allow it to survive long enough to trigger its Unburden ability, transforming from a slow, supportive baker's assistant into a blistering fast combatant.
