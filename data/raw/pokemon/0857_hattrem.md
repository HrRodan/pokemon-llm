## Identity & Lore
Hattrem (Pokedex #857) is the Serene Pokémon, a mono-Psychic type first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Despite its "Serene" classification and its charming pink, humanoid appearance, Hattrem harbors a surprisingly violent temperament. It is highly sensitive to the strong emotions of those around it; should anyone—friend or foe—express intense feelings in its vicinity, Hattrem will promptly "silence" them by pummeling them with the braid-like appendages on its head. This behavior serves as a precursor to its final evolution, Hatterene, which is known to have a **Gigantamax form** that can blast opponents with massive beams of psychic energy. Hattrem typically inhabits quiet, secluded areas where it can avoid the emotional turbulence of other creatures.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 57, Attack 40, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 86, Sp. Def 73, Speed 49.
* **Archetype:** Eviolite Special Attacker / Trick Room Setter. Due to its low speed and respectable Special Attack for a middle-stage evolution, it excels in sub-optimal speed environments.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and utility pool, Hattrem thrives with moves such as **Psychic** for heavy STAB damage, **Dazzling Gleam** for Fairy-type coverage, **Mystical Fire** to lower the opponent's Special Attack, and **Trick Room** to capitalize on its naturally low Speed.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Healer:** Sometimes heals an ally's status condition in double battles.
    * **Anticipation:** Senses the opponent's dangerous moves (like one-hit KO or super-effective moves) upon entering battle.
    * **Magic Bounce (Hidden Ability):** A highly competitive ability that reflects status moves (like Stealth Rock, Taunt, or Will-O-Wisp) back at the attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Hattrem is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hatenna** once it reaches **Level 32**. After further training and emotional hardening, it evolves into the Forest Witch, **Hatterene**, starting at **Level 42**. As a member of the **Fairy Egg Group**, Hattrem shares biological traits with other mystical and delicate species, though its slow growth rate requires dedicated training. It stands at 0.6 meters and weighs only 4.8 kg, allowing it to move with a deceptive grace before delivering its signature violent "hushes."
