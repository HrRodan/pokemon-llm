## Identity & Lore
Politoed (Pokedex #186) is the Frog Pokémon, a distinct evolutionary divergence introduced in Generation II (Johto). Unlike its tadpole predecessors, Politoed sheds its fighting spirit for a charismatic, regal demeanor, characterized by its green skin and the curled hair on its head which serves as a symbol of status. Biologically, it acts as a leader within its ecosystem; when it emits a loud, echoing cry, groups of Poliwag and Poliwhirl gather from far and wide to obey its commands. This Pokémon dwells near the water's edge, often ruling over ponds and lakes with a cheerful but commanding presence. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is historically significant in competitive lore as one of the few Pokémon capable of summoning rain automatically.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 75, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 100, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Weather Setter / Special Support Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Ice, Steel, and Water** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its decent Special Attack and high bulk, key moves include **Scald** (for STAB and burn utility), **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Grass-types), **Earth Power** (to counter Electric-types), and **Perish Song** or **Encore** (for disrupting setup sweepers).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Water Absorb:** Restores HP if hit by a Water-type move instead of taking damage.
    *   **Damp:** Prevents the use of self-destructing moves like Explosion by any combatant.
    *   **Drizzle (Hidden Ability):** Summon rain when the Pokémon enters the battle. This is Politoed's most viable competitive attribute, allowing it to anchor "Rain Teams" by boosting Water moves and activating abilities like Swift Swim for teammates.

## Evolution & Biology
Politoed is the final stage of a split 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Poliwhirl** only when **traded while holding a King's Rock**. This serves as an alternative to Poliwhirl's other evolution, Poliwrath (which requires a Water Stone). Politoed belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and is often found commanding its pre-evolutions, Poliwag and Poliwhirl, in the wild.
