## Identity & Lore
Azumarill (Pokedex #184) is the Aqua Rabbit Pokémon, first discovered in **Generation II (Johto)**. Designed for an aquatic existence, it lives at the water's edge and spends the vast majority of its day submerged. Its blue fur and bubble-like white patterns serve as effective camouflage, making it difficult for enemies and prey to spot it within the water. While originally a pure Water-type, Azumarill gained the secondary Fairy-type in Generation VI, significantly altering its biological classification and combat capabilities. It is the fully evolved form of the Azurill line.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 50, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 80, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual Water/Fairy type, it is **weak to Grass, Electric, Poison, and Steel**. It offers excellent defensive utility, **resisting Fire, Water, Ice, Fighting, Bug, and Dark** moves, and possesses a total **Immunity to Dragon-type** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** despite its low base Attack stat, it functions best as a physical attacker due to its ability. Key moves include **Liquidation** and **Play Rough** for primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Superpower** for heavy Fighting-type damage against Steel-types, and **Ice Spinner** for coverage against Grass and Dragon types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Thick Fat:** Reduces damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves by 50%, reinforcing its natural bulk.
    *   **Huge Power:** The defining ability for Azumarill's viability; it doubles the Pokémon's Attack stat, mitigating its low base stats and turning it into a powerhouse.
    *   **Sap Sipper (Hidden):** Grants immunity to Grass-type moves (a major weakness) and boosts the Attack stat if hit by one.

## Evolution & Biology
Azumarill is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Marill** starting at **Level 18**. Marill is the evolved form of the baby Pokémon **Azurill**, which evolves only when leveled up with **High Friendship** (happiness value of 160 or higher). It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Fairy** Egg Groups.
