## Identity & Lore
Wingull (Pokédex #278) is the dual-type Water/Flying **Seagull Pokémon** introduced in Generation III (**Hoenn** region). Distinguished by its long, tapered wings, this Pokémon rides ocean updrafts, gliding across the sky as if it were skating without flapping its wings. It nests on steep cliffs by the sea and possesses a unique behavioral habit of carrying prey and valuables inside its beak, hiding them in various locations. While small, Wingull serves as the precursor to the heavy-rainfall inducing Pelipper, making it a common sight in maritime environments.

## Evolution & Biology
Wingull is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Pelipper** starting at **Level 25**. In the wild, Wingull may occasionally be found holding a **Pretty Wing**. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Flying** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles. Its biological design allows it to float indefinitely on air currents, conserving energy while hunting for food in the ocean.
