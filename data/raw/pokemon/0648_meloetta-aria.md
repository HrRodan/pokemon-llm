## Identity & Lore
Meloetta-Aria (Pokedex #648) is the Melody Pokémon, a rare and graceful Mythical being first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a humanoid figure with musical bar-like hair and a jewel on its forehead, Meloetta is said to have inspired the greatest works of art and music in history. Its vocalizations are more than just art; using a special method of singing, it can control the emotions of anyone who hears its melody. While it is predominantly seen in its Aria Forme, it possesses a unique biological trait: upon performing the ancient move **Relic Song** in battle, it transforms into its **Pirouette Forme**, shifting from a special-oriented Normal/Psychic type to a physical-oriented Normal/Fighting type. It does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, as its primary gimmick is this fluid transformation between melodic and rhythmic states.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 77, Defense 77, Sp. Atk 128, Sp. Def 128, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Special Sweeper. Its high Special Defense and HP allow it to take hits from special attackers while retaliating with devastating power.
* **Type Matchups:** In its Aria Forme, it is **weak to Bug and Dark**. It **resists Psychic** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost** (due to its Normal typing).
* **Move Selection:** Meloetta-Aria excels when utilizing its massive Special Attack and its signature move. Key moves include **Relic Song** (its signature move that enables Forme change and has a high sleep chance), **Psychic** (primary STAB), **Hyper Voice** (powerful Normal STAB), and **Shadow Ball** or **Thunderbolt** for expansive coverage.
* **Abilities:** Serene Grace (This ability doubles the chance of secondary effects occurring, such as the sleep chance of Relic Song, the flinch chance of Zen Headbutt, or the Special Defense drop chance of Psychic).

## Evolution & Biology
Meloetta-Aria is a unique Mythical Pokémon and is not part of a standard evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon; however, it is capable of a **Forme Change**. This transformation is triggered exclusively by using the move **Relic Song** during combat, which shifts it into its Pirouette Forme. Outside of battle, it typically reverts to its Aria Forme. As a Mythical Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot breed. It has a high hatch counter of 120, reflecting its status as a legendary-tier entity. Its biology is deeply tied to sound, often found in locations where music or art are celebrated, and it is known to carry a **Star Piece** on rare occasions.
