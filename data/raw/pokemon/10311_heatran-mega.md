## Identity & Lore
Heatran-Mega (Pokedex #10311) is the Lava Dome Pokémon, a legendary titan that embodies the raw power of the earth's core. Originating from the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), this massive Fire/Steel-type legendary is known to dwell deep within volcanic caves, such as Stark Mountain. Its body is composed of rugged steel and boiling magma; its blood circulates as molten orange liquid, providing it with intense internal heat. Heatran is unique among quadrupeds for its cross-shaped feet, which act as high-pressure suction pads, allowing its 570kg frame to crawl effortlessly across volcanic ceilings and vertical walls. While the base form is a cornerstone of the Sinnoh legends, this Mega Evolution represents a significant surge in its volcanic energy, resulting in a hardened metallic carapace and a staggering increase in its internal temperature.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 91, Attack 120, Defense 106, Sp. Atk 175, Sp. Def 141, Speed 67.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker. With a massive Special Attack of 175 and significant Special Defense, it serves as a terrifying tank that can dismantle defensive cores while absorbing powerful elemental hits.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**, and is also weak to **Water and Fighting**. However, its Steel/Fire typing provides an elite defensive profile, granting it an **immunity to Poison** and resistances to **Normal, Flying, Psychic, and Dragon**. It is exceptionally resistant (0.25x damage) to **Bug, Steel, Grass, Ice, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Special Attack, its most effective arsenal includes **Magma Storm** (a signature trapping move), **Flash Cannon** (for Steel-type STAB), **Earth Power** (for coverage against other Fire and Electric types), and **Heat Wave** or **Solar Beam** (to punish Water-type switch-ins).
* **Abilities:** Typically associated with **Flash Fire**, which grants it an immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts its own Fire attacks when hit by one. Its secondary potential involves **Flame Body**, which provides a chance to burn any opponent that makes direct physical contact with its searing metallic hide.

## Evolution & Biology
Heatran-Mega is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to a standard evolutionary line. It is unique among many legendaries for having a gender ratio, though it cannot breed, belonging to the **No-Eggs** group. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full combat potential. Biologically, it is a quadruped of immense weight, and its presence is often indicated by the searing heat it radiates, which can melt the very stone it walks upon. While it does not evolve from other species, its "Mega" state represents a temporary, high-energy transformation triggered by a Mega Stone, pushing its steel-plated body and lava-infused heart to their absolute limits.
