## Identity & Lore
Mega Metagross (Pokedex #10076) is the massive, quadruple-brained Iron Leg Pokémon and the Mega Evolved form of the Hoenn region’s primary pseudo-legendary. Originating from Generation III (Hoenn), this Steel/Psychic-type powerhouse is the result of a Metagross reacting to a Metagrossite Mega Stone. Its biology is a marvel of biological computing; by fusing its four brains, it achieves a cognitive capacity that far surpasses even the most advanced supercomputers, allowing it to calculate millions of combat permutations in milliseconds. In its Mega Evolved state, it often tilts its body forward, utilizing its powerful, clawed limbs not just for terrestrial traversal in rough-terrain habitats but as devastating aerial weaponry. While this form is its peak, Metagross is also known for its rarity and its association with champions like Steven Stone.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Metagross is the final temporary stage of a complex three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Beldum**, which evolves into **Metang** starting at Level 20 (traditionally depicted as two Beldum fusing). Metang then evolves into the standard **Metagross** at Level 45 (the fusion of two Metang). Mega Evolution is a temporary state triggered in battle. Biologically, it is a genderless entity belonging to the **Mineral** egg group. Despite its immense weight of 942.9 kg, it can hover using electromagnetic magnetism. It is notoriously difficult to capture, possessing one of the lowest catch rates in the Pokémon world, often requiring Heavy Balls or Master Balls for reliable acquisition.
