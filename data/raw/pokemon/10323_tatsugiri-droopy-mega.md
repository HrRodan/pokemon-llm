## Identity & Lore
Tatsugiri-Droopy-Mega (Pokedex #10323) is the Pink-colored Droopy Form of the Mimicry Pokémon, a cunning Dragon/Water-type originally discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Despite its diminutive size, measuring only 0.6 meters, it is one of the most intelligent predators in its habitat. It is most famous for its symbiotic—and somewhat manipulative—relationship with the massive Pokémon Dondozo. This specific "Mega" variant represents an enhanced state of the Droopy Form, emphasizing its role as the "brains" of the underwater duo. Tatsugiri often feigns weakness or plays dead to lure in prey, only to command a Dondozo to launch a surprise attack from beneath. While Tatsugiri does not have a traditional Gigantamax form, its presence in a Dondozo's mouth via the Commander ability is a unique mechanical equivalent to a "fusion" or power-up state.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 65, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 125, Speed 92.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Special Tank. With a massive Special Attack of 135 and high Special Defense, it functions as a powerful artillery piece that can survive significant elemental hits.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy** types. Conversely, it possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x)** to Water and Fire moves, and also resists Steel-type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack stat, key moves for this Pokémon include **Draco Meteor** (for high-burst STAB damage), **Hydro Pump** (its primary Water-type nuke), **Dragon Pulse** (for consistent damage), and **Muddy Water** (which provides spread damage and accuracy reduction in double battles).
* **Abilities:** **Commander** (When this Pokémon enters the field in a Double Battle with Dondozo, it jumps into Dondozo's mouth, boosting all of Dondozo's stats by two stages), **Storm Drain** (Provides immunity to Water-type moves and boosts Special Attack when hit by one).

## Evolution & Biology
Tatsugiri is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is part of the **Water 2** Egg Group and is known for its distinct phenotypic variations: the Curly (Orange), Droopy (Pink), and Stretchy (Yellow) forms. Each form is associated with a different stat boost when used in conjunction with Dondozo's "Order Up" move—specifically, the **Droopy Form** focuses on boosting the partner's Defense. Despite its fragile appearance, its biology is hardy, belonging to the "fish" shape category but possessing the Dragon type, which grants it superior elemental resistances compared to standard aquatic life. It has a medium-slow growth rate and a relatively high capture rate of 100, though finding one without its Dondozo guardian can be a challenge in the wild.
