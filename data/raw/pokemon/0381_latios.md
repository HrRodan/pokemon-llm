## Identity & Lore
Latios (Pokedex #381) is the Legendary **Eon Pokémon**, introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. A highly intelligent creature capable of understanding human speech, this dual-type Dragon/Psychic Pokémon is known for its ability to project images of what it sees or imagines directly into the minds of others. Latios possesses a streamlined, aerodynamic blue body that allows it to fly faster than a jet plane when it tucks in its limbs. It is the male counterpart to **Latias**, and while it does not evolve, it is capable of achieving **Mega Evolution** to become **Mega Latios** when holding the Latiosite. Often associated with the **Soul Dew** item, Latios prefers habitats near the **water's edge** but is frequently depicted as a roaming Pokémon, traversing the skies with incredible speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Latios is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon, though it shares a duo dynamic with Latias. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group, meaning it cannot be bred. In its lore, Latios is extremely protective of its counterpart and opens its heart only to Trainers with a compassionate spirit.
