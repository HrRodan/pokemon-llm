## Identity & Lore
Mega Chandelure (Pokedex #10291) is the ultimate evolved form of the Luring Pokémon, representing a spectral powerhouse originating from the Unova region (Generation V). This Ghost/Fire-type entity is a haunting master of spiritual energy, known to absorb the souls of the departed to fuel the hypnotic, flickering violet flames on its many-tiered arms. While the base form is a staple of haunted mansions and dark corridors, Mega Chandelure transcends its stationary chandelier appearance, becoming a larger, more imposing 2.5-meter tall vessel of ethereal fire. Its lore suggests that those mesmerized by the rhythmic waving of its flames are led into a permanent trance, their life force harvested to keep its spectral fires burning eternally. This Mega Evolution pushes its internal temperature and spiritual pressure to their limits, manifesting as a black-clad, arm-shaped specter of immense power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 75, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 175, Sp. Def 110, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker. With a monumental Special Attack stat of 175, Mega Chandelure is designed to punch massive holes in the opponent's defensive core.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost, Dark, Ground, Rock, and Water**. Conversely, it possesses an impressive defensive profile, featuring a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**, and standard resistances to **Steel, Grass, Ice, Poison, Fairy, and Fire**. Furthermore, it is **immune to Normal and Fighting** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its world-class Special Attack, Mega Chandelure excels with high-intensity blasts and tactical coverage. Key moves include **Shadow Ball** for consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) ghost damage, **Fire Blast** for incinerating steel and grass types, **Energy Ball** to surprise-check Water and Rock-type threats, and **Calm Mind** to further bolster its already terrifying offensive presence.
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-ability data is restricted, this Pokémon typically utilizes **Flash Fire** (providing an immunity to Fire and boosting its own Fire moves) or **Infiltrator** (allowing it to bypass Substitutes and Screens), making it a nightmare for defensive stall teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Chandelure is the final stage of a sophisticated three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Litwick**, a small candle-like Pokémon that siphons life energy. Litwick evolves into the lamp-like **Lampent** upon reaching **Level 41**. The transition to the base Chandelure form is achieved only when Lampent is **exposed to a Dusk Stone**. The shift into its Mega form is triggered through Mega Evolution in battle, provided it is holding its specific Mega Stone. Biologically, it belongs to the **Indeterminate** Egg Group and is known for its "Medium-Slow" growth rate, requiring significant investment from a Trainer to reach its full potential. Despite its heavy appearance, it weighs approximately 69.6 kg and floats effortlessly through the air, seeking out spiritual energy in the darkness.
