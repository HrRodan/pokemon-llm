## Identity & Lore
Totodile (Pokedex #158) is the Big Jaw Pokémon, a small but formidable bipedal reptile native to the **Generation II (Johto)** region. Distinguished by its blue scales and prominent red spines, this Water-type starter Pokémon inhabits the water's edge. Despite its diminutive size, Totodile possesses powerful, well-developed jaws capable of crushing anything, making it dangerous even when it intends to be playful. Its trainer must exercise extreme caution, as Totodile has a habit of biting anything that moves. While it currently has no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it serves as the base form for the formidable Feraligatr.

## Combat Profile

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Torrent:** Powers up Water-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden Ability):** Significantly boosts the power of moves that have secondary effects (like Ice Punch or Waterfall) but removes those secondary effects.

## Evolution & Biology
Totodile is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Croconaw** starting at **Level 18**, which subsequently evolves into **Feraligatr** starting at **Level 30**. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** egg groups, allowing it to breed with a wide variety of reptilian and amphibious Pokémon.
