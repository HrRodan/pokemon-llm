## Identity & Lore
Pelipper (Pokedex #279) is the Water Bird Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Flying creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in coastal colonies near the sea, this Pokémon is defined by its massive, pouch-like bill, which serves as a biological cargo hold. Pelipper acts as a "messenger of the skies," using its beak to safely transport small Pokémon, eggs, and mail across long distances. While generally docile, it is a protective courier that uses its buoyancy to rest on ocean waves when tired. Though it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Pelipper serves a critical ecological and competitive niche as a premier weather setter in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 50, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 70, Speed 65.
*   **Archetype:** Defensive Weather Setter / Bulky Special Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** Pelipper possesses a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Electric-type** attacks and a standard weakness to Rock-type moves. However, it boasts an immunity to Ground-type moves and resists Bug, Fighting, Fire, Steel, and Water-type damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its respectable Special Attack and weather capabilities, its optimal moveset includes **Hurricane** (which gains 100% accuracy in rain), **Hydro Pump** or **Scald** for high-damage Water STAB, **Ice Beam** for coverage against Dragon and Grass types, and **Roost** for reliable longevity and recovery.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents the Pokémon's accuracy from being lowered.
    *   **Drizzle:** The Pokémon summons a heavy rainstorm when it enters a battle. This is Pelipper's defining competitive trait, boosting Water moves and enabling strategies for teammates.
    *   **Rain Dish (Hidden):** The Pokémon gradually regains HP in rain, synergizing perfectly with Drizzle.

## Evolution & Biology
Pelipper is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Wingull** starting at **Level 25**. There are no special items or conditions required for this evolution beyond experience accumulation. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 1** and **Flying** Egg Groups. In the wild, Pelipper may occasionally be found holding a **Lucky Egg** or a **Pretty Wing**.
