## Identity & Lore
Rolycoly (Pokedex #837) is the Coal Pokémon, a fascinating Rock-type creature first discovered in coal mines approximately 400 years ago. Originating from the Galar region in Generation VIII, its body is composed of material nearly identical to coal. It typically inhabits dark, subterranean environments like the Galar Mine, where it can be seen rolling through rough terrain on its singular wheel-like leg. While Rolycoly itself is small and unassuming, it represents the base form of a powerful evolutionary line that culminates in Coalossal, a Pokémon capable of achieving a massive, mountain-like Gigantamax form. Its design reflects the industrial heritage of the Galar region, serving as both a source of fuel and a partner to miners of the past.

## Evolution & Biology
Rolycoly is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the coal-cart-like **Carkol** once it reaches **Level 18**. Carkol later matures into the bipedal furnace **Coalossal** starting at **Level 34**. Biologically, Rolycoly is categorized within the **Mineral** egg group, and its growth is classified as medium-slow. Its physical structure is sturdy and ball-shaped, allowing it to navigate narrow mine shafts with ease. Trainers often value Rolycoly not just for its evolution, but for its utility in the field, as its fire-related abilities make it an excellent companion for traveling through cold climates or assisting in industrial tasks.
