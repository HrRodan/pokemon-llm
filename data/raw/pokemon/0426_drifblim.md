## Identity & Lore
Drifblim (Pokedex #426) is the Blimp Pokémon, a dual-type Ghost/Flying entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its spherical, purple body and four limb-like appendages used to control flight, this Pokémon drifts aimlessly through the sky. According to lore, swarms of Drifblim appear at dusk, carried aloft on the winds, and are rumored to ferry spirits to the afterlife; it is said that those who grab onto them vanish, never to be seen again. Unlike many flying Pokémon, it controls its altitude by generating and releasing gas within its body rather than flapping wings. While it lacks Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its eerie nature makes it a prominent figure in Sinnoh ghost stories.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 150, Attack 80, Defense 44, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 54, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Disruptor / Unburden Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, Ice, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses valuable immunities, taking **no damage from Normal, Fighting, and Ground** moves, and **resists Grass, Poison, and Bug** (double resistance).
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high HP and decent Special Attack, key moves include **Shadow Ball** for consistent STAB damage and **Hex**, which synergizes with status conditions. For utility and survival, it relies on **Strength Sap** to heal its massive HP pool while lowering the opponent's Attack, and **Tailwind** to double the team's speed.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Aftermath:** Damages the attacker if Drifblim faints from a direct contact move.
    *   **Unburden:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat when its held item is used or lost, making it a dangerous sweeper when paired with consumable items like Seeds.
    *   **Flare Boost (Hidden):** Increases Special Attack by 50% when the Pokémon is burned, allowing for a niche offensive presence.

## Evolution & Biology
Drifblim is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Drifloon** when leveled up to **Level 28**. Unlike its pre-evolution, which seeks to carry away children, Drifblim is generally more passive, drifting wherever the wind takes it. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group, and hatching a Drifblim egg requires approximately 30 egg cycles.
