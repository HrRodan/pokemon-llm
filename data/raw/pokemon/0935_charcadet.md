## Identity & Lore
Charcadet (Pokedex #935) is the Fire Child Pokémon, a sentient being born when burnt charcoal was imbued with life and a fierce fighting spirit. Originating in the Paldea region of Generation IX, this humanoid Pokémon is characterized by its red coloration and its relentless drive to challenge opponents far stronger than itself. Despite its small stature—standing only 0.6 meters tall—it radiates an internal heat fueled by its fiery soul. While Charcadet does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is unique for its "latent potential" stored within its soot-covered body, which allows it to evolve into two vastly different armored warriors depending on the historical relic it encounters.

## Evolution & Biology
Charcadet is part of a flexible two-stage evolutionary line that branches based on the armor it dons. It belongs to the Humanshape Egg Group and has a slow growth rate, reflecting the discipline required to master its flames. It evolves through the following specific methods:
* It evolves into **Armarouge** (Fire/Psychic) when exposed to an **Auspicious Armor**, a set of armor belonging to a distinguished warrior.
* It evolves into **Ceruledge** (Fire/Ghost) when exposed to a **Malicious Armor**, a set of armor steeped in grudges.

Biologically, its body is composed primarily of carbonized material that serves as fuel for its internal fire. Its large, expressive eyes often glow with the intensity of its current "fighting spirit," a trait that persists and intensifies regardless of which evolutionary path it takes.
