## Identity & Lore
Mega Kangaskhan (Pokedex #115) is the Parent Pokémon, a powerful Mega Evolved form of the classic Generation I (Kanto) species. Originally discovered in the lush grasslands of the Kanto region, this brown, bipedal Pokémon is defined by its maternal instincts. While a standard Kangaskhan carries an infant in its belly pouch until the child is three years old, Mega Evolution—triggered by the Kangaskhanite Mega Stone—causes the child to temporarily grow and leap from the pouch to fight alongside its mother. This transformation represents a massive spike in the child's combat prowess and the mother's protective drive. Although Kangaskhan does not have a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution was historically one of the most dominant forces in competitive history, turning a single Pokémon into a dual-attacking duo.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 105, Attack 125, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 100, Speed 100.
* **Archetype:** Physical Bulky Attacker / Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, Mega Kangaskhan is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost**-type moves. It has no resistances. 
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its immense Physical Attack and its signature ability, Mega Kangaskhan excels with **Power-Up Punch** (which provides a double Attack boost in a single turn), **Fake Out** (for immediate flinching and chip damage), **Sucker Punch** (to bypass its mid-tier speed with priority), and **Return** or **Double-Edge** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage.
* **Abilities:** **Parental Bond** (This unique ability allows Mega Kangaskhan to attack twice in one turn. The second hit, delivered by the child, deals 25% of the original damage, effectively breaking through Sturdy, Focus Sashes, and Substitute while doubling the chance of secondary move effects like stat boosts or flinches).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Kangaskhan is a unique temporary stage in the Kangaskhan biological line. Kangaskhan itself is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species through traditional leveling. It enters its Mega Form only during battle when exposed to a **Kangaskhanite**. Biologically, the species is exclusively female and belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group. Despite being a heavy-set Pokémon weighing 100.0 kg, it is surprisingly agile. In the wild, they are known for their fierce protectiveness; any threat to the child is met with a flurry of dizzying punches. Their breeding cycle is relatively slow, indicated by a hatch counter of 20, reflecting the long period the mother spends nurturing her young.
