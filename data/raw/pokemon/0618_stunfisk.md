## Identity & Lore
Stunfisk (Pokedex #618) is the Trap Pokémon, a unique dual-type Ground and Electric creature first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Known for its flat, mud-colored body, it frequents coastal areas and marshes, burying itself in the mud to wait for prey. Its biology is remarkably resilient; its skin is so tough that it remains completely unharmed even when stepped on by a sumo wrestler. When it senses prey—or an unsuspecting traveler—it releases a powerful electric burst from the yellow markings on its body, often smiling as it delivers the shock. While the Unovan form is the most common, a regional variant known as **Galarian Stunfisk** exists in the Galar region, sporting a Ground/Steel typing and a bear-trap-like appearance. Stunfisk does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 109, Attack 66, Defense 84, Sp. Atk 81, Sp. Def 99, Speed 32.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Tank / Defensive Disruptor. Its high HP and respectable Special Defense allow it to soak up hits while spreading status conditions.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Ice, and Ground**. It **resists Poison, Rock, Steel, and Flying**, and it possesses a total **immunity to Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Stunfisk relies on its Special Attack and utility to wear down opponents. Key moves include **Discharge** (for STAB damage and a high paralysis chance), **Earth Power** (its primary Ground-type special STAB), **Scald** (essential coverage that can burn physical attackers to compensate for its lower Defense), and **Stealth Rock** (to provide entry hazard support).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Static:** Provides a 30% chance to paralyze any opponent that makes contact, punishing physical attackers.
    * **Limber:** Grants total immunity to paralysis, ensuring Stunfisk's already low Speed isn't further hampered.
    * **Sand Veil:** Increases evasion during a sandstorm, making it a viable niche pick for sand-based defensive teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Stunfisk is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species, though its Galarian form serves as a biological relative with distinct adaptations. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Groups, reflecting its muddy, aquatic habitat and flexible, fish-like body shape. In the wild, it is occasionally found carrying **Soft Sand**, which it uses to boost the power of its Ground-type maneuvers. Despite its appearance, it is remarkably patient, capable of staying submerged in muck for days while waiting for the vibrations of a passing target.
