## Identity & Lore
Gastly (Pokedex #092) is the Gas Pokémon, originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Composed almost entirely of thin, purple gas, this entity is categorized within the Amorphous egg group and typically resides in dark caves or dilapidated structures. According to biological research, its body is 95% gas, allowing it to slip through walls and envelop prey to induce fainting or sleep without detection; however, this constitution makes it highly vulnerable to strong winds. Gastly is the first stage of a prestigious evolutionary line that culminates in Gengar, a Pokémon capable of achieving both **Mega Evolution** and a **Gigantamax** form in later generations.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 35, Defense 30, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 35, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Ghost/Poison** type, it is weak to **Ghost**, **Dark**, and **Psychic** moves. While its typing typically dictates a weakness to Ground, its ability negates this entirely. It resists **Grass**, **Fairy**, **Bug**, and **Poison** attacks and possesses natural immunities to **Normal** and **Fighting** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** With a base Special Attack of 100—exceptionally high for a first-stage Pokémon—Gastly excels with **Shadow Ball** and **Sludge Bomb** for primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). Coverage options include **Thunderbolt** or **Dazzling Gleam** to handle flying and dragon types, while **Destiny Bond** is often used to capitalize on its frailty by taking an opponent down with it.
*   **Abilities:** **Levitate** (Grants full immunity to all Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, removing a critical weakness).

## Evolution & Biology
Gastly is part of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Haunter** starting at **Level 25**. Haunter subsequently evolves into the final stage, **Gengar**, only when triggered by a **Trade** between trainers. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
