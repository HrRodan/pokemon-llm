## Identity & Lore
Gothitelle (Pokedex #576) is the Astral Body Pokémon, a sophisticated bipedal species known for its profound connection to the cosmos. Appearing in the Unova region during Generation V, this purple-colored Pokémon possesses a striking aesthetic reminiscent of gothic fashion, adorned with white bow-like structures. According to ancient lore, Gothitelle’s intense psychic power is so immense that it can distort the space around it, rendering starry skies from thousands of light-years away visible to the naked eye. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form, its ability to predict the future based on the movement of the stars makes it a sought-after, albeit eerie, companion for many trainers.

## Evolution & Biology
Gothitelle is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Gothita**, which evolves into **Gothorita** starting at Level 32. The process culminates when Gothorita reaches **Level 41**, evolving into the powerful Gothitelle. Biologically, it is classified within the **Humanshape** Egg Group, and it is known to be a "medium-slow" grower, requiring significant training to reach its full potential. It is often found holding a **Persim Berry** in the wild, perhaps to ward off the confusion that might arise from its own reality-warping psychic energies.
