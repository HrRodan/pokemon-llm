## Identity & Lore
Spiritomb (Pokedex #442) is the Forbidden Pokémon introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. It is a spectral, purple projection formed by the amalgamation of **108 spirits**. According to lore, these spirits were bound to a fissure in an **Odd Keystone** over 500 years ago as punishment for their misdeeds, preventing the entity from roaming free. Spiritomb does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, but it is deeply tied to the number 108, which is reflected in its weight, base defense stats, and the number of spirits comprising its being.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 92, Defense 108, Sp. Atk 92, Sp. Def 108, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Mixed Tank / Disruptor.
*   **Type Matchups:** Prior to Generation VI, Spiritomb had no elemental weaknesses. Currently, it is **weak to Fairy** types. It possesses valuable immunities to **Normal, Fighting, and Psychic** attacks, and resists **Poison**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its equal offensive stats and low Speed, Spiritomb functions best with a mix of priority and disruption. Key moves include **Sucker Punch** (to bypass its low speed), **Will-O-Wisp** (to cripple physical attackers), **Pain Split** (to sustain health given its low HP base), and **Foul Play** (to punish high-attack opponents).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces the opposing Pokémon to use double the PP for every move, aiding in stall tactics.
    *   **Infiltrator (Hidden):** Allows Spiritomb's attacks to bypass the foe's barriers like Substitute, Reflect, and Light Screen.

## Evolution & Biology
Spiritomb is a standalone Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Group. Biologically, it is defined by the Odd Keystone that anchors it; without this stone, the collection of spirits would likely dissipate. Its hatching cycle is notoriously long, with a hatch counter of 30 cycles.
