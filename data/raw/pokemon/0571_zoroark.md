## Identity & Lore
Zoroark (Pokedex #571) is the Illusion Fox Pokémon, a cunning and protective species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its bipedal, fox-like appearance with a voluminous slate-gray and crimson mane, Zoroark is legendary for its ability to create hyper-realistic illusions that fool even the most perceptive humans and Pokémon. These illusions are not just used for hunting but are vital for protecting the pack; a single Zoroark can hide an entire den or conjure the image of a much more terrifying Pokémon to ward off threats. While the standard form is a pure Dark-type, a distinct regional variant known as **Hisuian Zoroark** (Normal/Ghost-type) exists in the ancient Hisui region, born from restless spirits. Zoroark's lore is deeply tied to the bonds it shares with its kin, often portrayed as a fiercely loyal guardian that uses its deceptive powers to ensure the safety of its family.

## Evolution & Biology
Zoroark is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Zorua** when it reaches **Level 30**. Biologically, it is a highly intelligent mammal that primarily navigates its environment in an upright, bipedal stance. Despite its slender frame and "glass cannon" defensive profile, its high offensive pressure makes it a formidable predator. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, and trainers often find that breeding and hatching a Zorua requires significant patience, with a hatch counter of 20. Its growth rate is medium-slow, reflecting the time and discipline required to master its complex illusory abilities.
