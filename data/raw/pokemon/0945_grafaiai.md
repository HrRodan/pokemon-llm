## Identity & Lore
Grafaiai (Pokedex #945) is the Toxic Monkey Pokémon, a unique dual-type Poison/Normal creature first discovered in the Paldea region of Generation IX. Known for its nocturnal and moody disposition, Grafaiai is easily recognized by its large, colorful eyes and its elongated middle finger, which it uses to paint intricate, neon patterns on trees. This artistic behavior is actually a predatory tactic; it produces poisonous saliva that changes color based on the berries it consumes, using the sweet-smelling, toxic "paint" to attract and paralyze bug Pokémon for food. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its distinct biological niche as a territorial "street artist" of the forest makes it one of the most culturally iconic species in the Paldean wilderness.

## Evolution & Biology
Grafaiai is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Shroodle** once it reaches **Level 28**. Biologically, it is a specialized primate that thrives in forested areas where it can mark its territory. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, and its reproductive cycles are relatively standard, with a hatch counter of 20. Despite its diminutive height of 0.7 meters, its agility and specialized toxins allow it to compete with much larger predators in the Paldean ecosystem.
