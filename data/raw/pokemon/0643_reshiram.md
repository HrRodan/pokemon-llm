## Identity & Lore
Reshiram (#643) is the Vast White Pokémon, a legendary figure representing the concept of "Truth" within the Unova region of Generation V. This majestic creature is characterized by its white, avian-influenced draconic body and a distinctive, jet-engine-like tail that flares with intense heat. According to Unovan myth, Reshiram sided with the older brother in the war of Truth and Ideals, incinerating the world with its tail to purge deception. Its physiological design allows it to move the atmosphere and change the world's weather through the heat generated by its tail. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Reshiram is a critical component of the "Tao Trio" and can undergo a unique **Fusion** with Kyurem using the DNA Splicers to become **White Kyurem**, significantly boosting its special offensive power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 120, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 150, Sp. Def 120, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Fire/Dragon-type, Reshiram is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Dragon**. Its dual typing is defensively excellent, providing **resistances to Fire, Electric, Bug, and Steel**, and a **Double Resistance (4x) to Grass**. Notably, its Fire typing negates the traditional Dragon weakness to Ice.
* **Move Selection:** Reshiram excels when utilizing its massive Special Attack stat. Its signature move **Blue Flare** provides immense high-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), while **Fusion Flare** offers a reliable secondary Fire option that resonates with Zekrom’s power. For draconic coverage, **Draco Meteor** serves as its primary nuke, and **Earth Power** is essential for hitting opposing Rock and Fire types that might otherwise wall its primary attacks.
* **Abilities:** Turboblaze (Reshiram’s signature ability functions identically to Mold Breaker, allowing its moves to strike through defensive abilities such as Sturdy, Multiscale, or Flash Fire, ensuring its flames are never hindered by an opponent's biological traits).

## Evolution & Biology
Reshiram is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of a standard evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species through leveling or stones. However, it is biologically linked to Zekrom and Kyurem, as legends state they were once a single, powerful dragon. Reshiram belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its high hatch counter (120) reflects its status as a mythic entity of immense power. It is typically found in the Dragonspiral Tower or summoned via the Light Stone, an artifact that contains its essence during its dormant state.
