## Identity & Lore
Decidueye (Pokedex #724) is the Arrow Quill Pokémon, a master archer that first appeared in Generation VII (Alola). As the final evolution of the Alolan Grass-type starter, it transitions from the dual Grass/Flying type of its predecessors into a stoic Grass/Ghost guardian. Known for its cool and cautious demeanor, Decidueye uses its wing feathers as arrows, firing them with such incredible precision that it can pierce a small pebble at distances exceeding a hundred yards. It is capable of masking its presence entirely, moving through the canopy without a sound before unleashing a surprise barrage. While this Alolan form is well-known, world knowledge reveals a regional variant known as **Hisuian Decidueye**, which adopts a Grass/Fighting typing and a more grounded, samurai-inspired combat style.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 78, Attack 107, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 100, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Attacker / Utility Trapper. Decidueye functions as a versatile offensive threat with respectable special bulk, though its middling speed requires strategic positioning.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ice, Flying, Poison, Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground**, and possesses complete **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and signature mechanics, key moves include **Spirit Shackle** (a signature physical Ghost move that prevents the opponent from fleeing), **Leaf Blade** (a high-crit Grass STAB), **Shadow Sneak** (essential priority to compensate for low Speed), and **Roost** (reliable recovery to leverage its 100 Sp. Def).
* **Abilities:** **Overgrow** (Powers up Grass-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third); **Long Reach** (Hidden Ability: Allows the Pokémon to use moves without making physical contact, safely bypassing harmful abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet).

## Evolution & Biology
Decidueye is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Rowlet**, which evolves into **Dartrix** starting at Level 17. The transition to Decidueye occurs when Dartrix reaches **Level 34**. While it possesses wings and belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group, it loses its Flying type upon evolution, gaining the Ghost type to represent its spectral, shadow-dwelling nature. Its biology is unique among starters, blending avian features with a "hooded" appearance formed by its foliage. Trainers breeding Decidueye should note its Hatch Counter of 15, requiring significant travel to hatch its offspring.
