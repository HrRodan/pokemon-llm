## Identity & Lore
Rayquaza (Pokédex #384) is the Legendary Sky High Pokémon, a serpentine Dragon/Flying entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This ancient creature is said to have lived for hundreds of millions of years in the earth’s ozone layer, never descending to the ground. According to folklore, Rayquaza feeds on water and particles in the atmosphere, often consuming meteoroids for sustenance. Within the Hoenn mythos, it serves as the master of the "Weather Trio," possessing the power to quell the cataclysmic fighting between Groudon and Kyogre. While it does not have a standard evolution, Rayquaza is unique among Pokémon for its ability to **Mega Evolve** into Mega Rayquaza not by holding a stone, but by knowing the move Dragon Ascent.

## Evolution & Biology
Rayquaza is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of a traditional evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species. However, it undergoes a biological transformation into Mega Rayquaza during battle if the requisite conditions (knowing Dragon Ascent) are met. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** group and is typically encountered as a rare, static event in locations such as the Sky Pillar.
