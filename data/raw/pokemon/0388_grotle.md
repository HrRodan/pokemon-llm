## Identity & Lore
Grotle (Pokédex #388) is the Grove Pokémon, a pure Grass-type entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Visually defined by the hardened shell on its back which supports two bush-like trees, Grotle represents a walking ecosystem. In the wild, it possesses an innate ability to detect pure water sources, often carrying smaller Pokémon on its back to these hidden springs, showcasing a symbiotic and gentle temperament. It is the intermediate stage of the Sinnoh starter trio, bridging the gap between the small Turtwig and the continental-sized Torterra.
