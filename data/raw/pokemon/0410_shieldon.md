## Identity & Lore
Shieldon (Pokedex #410) is the Rock/Steel-type Shield Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Generation IV (Sinnoh)** region. Resurrected from an **Armor Fossil**, this prehistoric creature inhabited jungles approximately 100 million years ago. It is characterized by its small, quadrupedal gray body and a prominent, armor-like facial hide which is incredibly durable. Although it possesses a protective face capable of deflecting attacks, its back is vulnerable, requiring it to behave defensively in the wild. Shieldon is known to polish its face against tree trunks to maintain its luster. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the counterpart to the Cranidos line.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 42, Defense 118, Sp. Atk 42, Sp. Def 88, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Defensive Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a unique Rock/Steel type, it suffers from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fighting and Ground** types, and a standard weakness to Water. However, it boasts an immunity to Poison and **resistances** to Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy types.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its low offensive stats and high bulk, Shieldon functions best with utility and retaliation moves. Key selections include **Stealth Rock** for setting entry hazards, **Metal Burst** to return damage dealt by opponents (ignoring its low Attack stats), **Iron Defense** to further bolster its massive physical bulk, and **Iron Head** or **Ancient Power** for consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing survival against its 4x weaknesses.
    *   **Soundproof (Hidden):** Grants immunity to all sound-based moves, such as Roar, Hyper Voice, or Bug Buzz.

## Evolution & Biology
Shieldon is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Bastiodon** starting at **Level 30**. Unlike many fossil Pokémon that are aggressive hunters, Shieldon subsists on grass and berries. It belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 30 cycles. Its growth rate is classified as "slow-then-very-fast," indicating a difficulty curve in training that accelerates significantly at higher levels.
