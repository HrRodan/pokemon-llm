## Identity & Lore
Bisharp (Pokedex #625) is the Sword Blade Pokémon, a bipedal, humanoid creature encased in metallic, armor-like skin. First appearing in the Unova region (Generation V), it is characterized by the sharp blades protruding from its torso and head. Bisharp is a ruthless commander in the wild, typically leading a large pack of Pawniard. Its biology is defined by a brutal hierarchy; it engages in fierce, pitiless battles to maintain its position as the leader of the group. If a Bisharp is defeated in battle for the leadership position, it is driven from the pack into exile. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it gained a powerful new evolution, Kingambit, in the Paldea region (Generation IX), and its sleek, bladed design serves as the inspiration for the futuristic Paradox Pokémon, Iron Valiant.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 125, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 70, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dark/Steel type, it suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting** and is also weak to **Ground and Fire**. It maintains a staggering number of resistances, including Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Rock, Ghost, Dragon, Steel, and Dark, while being **immune to Psychic and Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 125 Attack, Bisharp excels with physical strikes and setup potential. Key moves include **Iron Head** for Steel-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and flinch chance, **Night Slash** or **Throat Chop** for consistent Dark-type damage, **Sucker Punch** (via its competitive history) or **Knock Off** for utility, and **Swords Dance** to double its offensive pressure.
* **Abilities:** **Defiant** is its most competitive ability, sharply increasing Attack when any of its stats are lowered (perfect for punishing *Intimidate* users). **Inner Focus** prevents the Pokémon from flinching and protects against *Intimidate* in newer generations. **Pressure** (Hidden Ability) forces the opponent to expend more PP, though it is less common in offensive builds.

## Evolution & Biology
Bisharp is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. it evolves from **Pawniard** starting at **Level 52**, representing a significant investment in training. In the Paldea region, Bisharp can reach its final form, **Kingambit**, through a unique ritual: it must defeat three other Bisharp that are leading packs of Pawniard while it is holding a **Leader's Crest**. Biologically, Bisharp are metallic and humanoid, belonging to the **Human-Like** egg group. They are known for their cold, calculated hunting methods, where they command Pawniard to weaken prey before Bisharp delivers the final, bladed blow.
