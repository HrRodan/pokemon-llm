## Identity & Lore
Lugia (Pokedex #249) is the Legendary **Diving Pokémon**, originally discovered in **Generation II (Johto)**. Residing deep within ocean trenches, it is said to isolate itself because its wings pack devastating power capable of blowing apart houses and causing 40-day storms. While it possesses aquatic habits and is known as the "Guardian of the Seas," it is distinctively a **Psychic/Flying** type rather than a Water type. Lugia is the mascot of *Pokémon Silver* and serves as the trio master to the Legendary Birds (Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres). It is the counterpart to Ho-Oh, forming the "Tower Duo." Its body is streamlined for underwater movement, colored primarily white with dark blue plates on its back.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 106, Attack 90, Defense 130, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 154, Speed 110.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Wall / Pressure Staller.
*   **Type Matchups:** Lugia possesses a double resistance (**0.25x**) to **Fighting** and resists **Grass** and **Psychic**. It is immune to **Ground** attacks. However, it is **weak to Rock, Ghost, Electric, Ice, and Dark**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive bulk and high speed, Lugia functions best with **Aeroblast** (its signature move with a high critical-hit ratio), **Recover** (or Roost) to maintain longevity, **Calm Mind** to bolster its offense and already high Special Defense, and **Whirlwind** to force out opponents attempting to set up.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces the opposing Pokémon to use 2 PP for every move, making Lugia an excellent staller against low-PP moves.
    *   **Multiscale (Hidden):** Halves the damage taken from any attack when Lugia is at full HP, making it incredibly difficult to knock out in a single hit.

## Evolution & Biology
Lugia is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species. As a Legendary, it belongs to the **No-Eggs** group and cannot breed. In the wild, it is exceptionally rare and traditionally encountered deep within the **Whirl Islands** while holding the Silver Wing. It has a notably low capture rate of 3, making it one of the most difficult Pokémon to tame.
