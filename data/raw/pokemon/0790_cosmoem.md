## Identity & Lore
Cosmoem (Pokedex #790) is the Protostar Pokémon, a Legendary entity first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This unique being serves as the "cocoon of the stars," representing a state of dormant, concentrated energy. Despite its diminutive height of only 0.1 meters, it is famously one of the heaviest Pokémon in existence, weighing a staggering 999.9 kg—a density that mimics a collapsing star. Its body, encased in a hard, golden shell, is motionless and appears dead to the casual observer, yet it remains faintly warm to the touch. Lore suggests it is absorbing starlight to fuel its eventual awakening. While Cosmoem itself does not have Mega or Gigantamax forms, it is the vital precursor to the "Light Trio" box legends and plays a central role in the narrative of *Pokémon Sun and Moon*, eventually evolving into the masters of the Sun or Moon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 43, Attack 29, Defense 131, Sp. Atk 29, Sp. Def 131, Speed 37.
* **Archetype:** Passive Defensive Tank. Its stats are heavily lopsided, featuring massive dual defenses but virtually no offensive presence or Speed.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Psychic type**, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses **resistances against Fighting and Psychic**.
* **Move Selection:** Cosmoem has an extremely limited movepool, focusing entirely on survival and positioning rather than direct damage. Key moves include **Cosmic Power** (to further boost its already high Defense and Sp. Def), **Teleport** (allowing it to pivot and switch out of danger), and it is known to rely on its evolutionary predecessors' or successors' themes, though it cannot naturally learn many offensive techniques.
* **Abilities:** Sturdy (Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit if it is at full HP, ensuring it can at least use a status move or Teleport before being overwhelmed).

## Evolution & Biology
Cosmoem is the second stage of a rare three-stage Legendary evolutionary line, a rarity among Mythical and Legendary species. It evolves from **Cosmog** starting at **Level 43**. Cosmoem acts as a transitional state; it evolves into its final form starting at **Level 53**, though the outcome depends on the celestial alignment (or game version): it becomes **Solgaleo** (the Sunne Pokémon) in *Pokémon Sun, Ultra Sun, or Sword*, and **Lunala** (the Moone Pokémon) in *Pokémon Moon, Ultra Moon, or Shield*. In the Alolan mythos, this process is seen as the birth of a new deity. As a Legendary Pokémon, Cosmoem belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group and cannot be bred in captivity. Its high hatch counter of 120 reflects the immense time and energy required for its celestial biology to manifest.
