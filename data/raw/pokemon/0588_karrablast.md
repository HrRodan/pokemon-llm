## Identity & Lore
Karrablast (Pokedex #588) is the Clamping Pokémon, a bipedal insectoid species first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Characterized by its hardy blue carapace and yellow mandibles, Karrablast is famous for its unique and predatory relationship with Shelmet. According to biological records, Karrablast specifically targets Shelmet to steal its shell during a process triggered by electrical stimulation. While Karrablast itself does not have a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its evolution represents one of the most specialized biological transitions in the Pokémon world, transforming from a vulnerable beetle into a heavily armored knight.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 75, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 45, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Physical Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Fire**. It possesses resistances against **Fighting, Ground, and Grass** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its superior physical Attack stat, Karrablast is most effective with **Megahorn** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **X-Scissor** for consistent Bug-type offense, **Drill Run** to provide critical ground-type coverage against its Fire and Rock-type weaknesses, and **Poison Jab** to threaten Grass and Fairy types.
* **Abilities:** **Swarm** (Powers up Bug-type moves when HP is low), **Shed Skin** (Has a 30% chance to cure status ailments every turn), and its Hidden Ability **No Guard** (Ensures all moves used by or against the Pokémon land successfully, notably making the low-accuracy Megahorn a guaranteed hit).

## Evolution & Biology
Karrablast is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the Bug/Steel-type **Escavalier** only when **traded for a Shelmet**; this unique trade trigger simulates Karrablast seizing the Shelmet's shell for its own use. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, reflecting its nature as a rapidly developing invertebrate. Its biology is centered around its aggressive mandibles, which it uses to dissolve and bypass the shells of its preferred prey.
