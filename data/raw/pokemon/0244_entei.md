## Identity & Lore
Entei (Pokedex #244) is the Legendary **Volcano Pokémon**, a massive quadrupedal beast introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Cloaked in brown fur with cloud-like smoke billowing from its back, Entei embodies the raw fury of magma. Legend states that a volcano erupts somewhere in the world every time this Pokémon barks. Possessing extreme power that it struggles to restrain, it spends much of its time racing headlong across grasslands and rugged terrain. In the lore of the Johto region, Entei is one of the **Legendary Beasts**, resurrected by the Rainbow Pokémon **Ho-Oh** from the ashes of the Burned Tower (formerly the Brass Tower) to represent the flames that consumed the building. While Entei has no standard evolution or Mega Evolution, a prehistoric **Paradox Pokémon** bearing a striking resemblance to it, known as **Gouging Fire**, has been documented in the Paldea region's Area Zero.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 115, Attack 115, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 75, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker / Physical Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Fire** type, Entei is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Water**. It **resists Bug, Steel, Grass, Ice, Fire, and Fairy** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack stat (115) and solid Speed (100), Entei's optimal move set includes its signature move **Sacred Fire** (which has a high chance to burn targets), **Extreme Speed** (for high-priority finishing blows), **Stone Edge** (for coverage against Flying and other Fire types), and **Stomping Tantrum** or **Iron Head**.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces opposing Pokémon to consume more PP when using moves, useful for stalling out low-PP attacks.
    *   **Inner Focus (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from flinching and, crucially in modern competitive formats, grants immunity to the Attack-lowering effect of the Intimidate ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Entei is a non-evolving Legendary Pokémon. It is a member of the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot be bred. In the wild, it is known to be a "roaming legendary," often fleeing immediately upon encountering a trainer. As a created entity in lore, it shares a trio dynamic with **Raikou** (Thunder) and **Suicune** (North Wind).
