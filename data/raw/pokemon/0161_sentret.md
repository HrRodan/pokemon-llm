## Identity & Lore
Sentret (Pokedex #161) is the Scout Pokémon, a cautious Normal-type entity introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in grasslands, this brown, quadrupedal mammal is defined by its nervous and vigilant nature. As a survival mechanism, Sentret uses its muscular tail to prop itself upright, allowing it to scan the surrounding area for predators or danger. While it possesses no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it serves as the initial evolutionary stage for the region's common mammal archetype.
