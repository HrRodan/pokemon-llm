## Identity & Lore
Clodsire (Pokedex #980) is the Spiny Fish Pokémon, a dual Poison and Ground-type introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This massive, heavy-set creature—standing 1.8 meters tall and weighing 223 kilograms—is a unique evolutionary relative of the Johtonian Quagsire. While it appears docile and spends its time at the bottom of ponds or marshes, it is highly territorial. When threatened, Clodsire retaliates by protruding thick, venomous spines from its body through its skin. This "all or nothing" defensive mechanism is a trademark of its survival strategy in the Paldean wilderness. Its muddy brown skin and quadrupedal shape allow it to blend into marshy habitats, where it lives as a primary predator of smaller aquatic organisms. While it currently possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique typing and utility make it a regional standout.

## Combat Profile

* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Psychic, Water, and Ice**. It **resists Fighting, Poison, Bug, Rock, and Fairy**, and possesses a total **Immunity to Electric**-type attacks.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Poison Point:** May poison attackers that make direct contact with its spines.
    * **Water Absorb:** A critical tactical ability that grants immunity to Water-type moves, instead healing Clodsire for 25% of its max HP—effectively neutralizing one of its primary weaknesses.
    * **Unaware (Hidden Ability):** Allows Clodsire to ignore the opponent's stat changes (like Swords Dance or Calm Mind) when taking or dealing damage, making it a premier counter to "set-up" sweepers.

## Evolution & Biology
Clodsire is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Paldean Wooper upon reaching **Level 20**. Unlike the blue-skinned Wooper found in the Johto region, the Paldean variant adapted to land life by covering itself in a poisonous film, a trait that culminates in Clodsire's ability to store and discharge toxins through its rib-like spines. Clodsire belongs to the **Water 1 and Ground** Egg Groups. With a hatch counter of 20, it is a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders. Its high base HP and specialized defensive abilities make it a staple in competitive "Stall" and "Balance" team compositions, where it functions as a pivot that can soak up powerful Special Attacks.
