## Identity & Lore
Mega Pyroar (#10295) is a formidable Fire and Normal-type "Royal Pokémon" representing the peak of the Pyroar lineage within the Kalos region (Generation VI). As the leader of a pride, this Pokémon is defined by its majestic mane of fire; lore states that the male with the largest mane holds the highest rank and commands the respect of the group. While this Mega Evolved form enhances its regal stature and thermal output, Pyroar is typically known to live in Savannah-like habitats where it protects its cubs, Litleo. In addition to this Mega Evolution, Pyroar is notable for its distinct gender dimorphism, with males sporting the iconic large mane and females possessing long, flowing hair-like crests.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 86, Attack 88, Defense 92, Sp. Atk 129, Sp. Def 86, Speed 126.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a blistering Speed tier of 126 and a massive Special Attack of 129, Mega Pyroar is designed to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and deliver heavy damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Rock, and Water**. Due to its Normal sub-typing, it possesses a unique **Immunity to Ghost-type moves**. It effectively **resists Fire, Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel, and Fairy** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Fire Blast** (high-power STAB), **Hyper Voice** (Normal STAB that bypasses Substitutes), **Solar Beam** (critical coverage for Water, Ground, and Rock types in sun), and **Will-O-Wisp** or **Noble Roar** (utility moves to cripple physical attackers).
* **Abilities:** While its base forms utilize **Unnerve** (prevents opponents from eating berries), **Rivalry** (boosts damage against the same gender), or **Moxie** (boosts Attack, though less useful for this special variant), a Mega Evolved Pyroar often benefits from abilities like **Adaptability** or **Solar Power** to further augment its offensive presence in competitive play.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Pyroar is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary progression. It begins its life as **Litleo**, a small cub that eventually **evolves into Pyroar starting at Level 35**. The transition to Mega Pyroar occurs through Mega Evolution, triggered when Pyroar holds its specific Mega Stone in battle. Biologically, it is a quadrupedal, leonine Pokémon characterized by its brown fur and intense pyrogenesis within its mane. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, requiring significant effort to breed for optimal competitive IVs. As a member of a "Royal" species, its behavior is territorial and protective, frequently utilizing its roar to communicate dominance over its pride's territory.
