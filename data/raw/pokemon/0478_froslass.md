## Identity & Lore
Froslass (Pokedex #478) is the Snow Land Pokémon, a dual-type Ice/Ghost entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Resembling a spectral woman in a white kimono, Froslass possesses a hollow body and is capable of breathing air as cold as -60 degrees Fahrenheit to freeze its foes. Its lore is often associated with the legend of the Yuki-onna, as it is said to freeze humans who get lost in snowy mountains and display them as decorations. Unlike its counterpart Glalie, which represents raw physical power, Froslass relies on speed and spectral manipulation. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is distinct for its unique typing and gender-specific evolutionary requirements.

## Evolution & Biology
Froslass is part of a split 2-stage evolutionary line originating from Snorunt. While a Snorunt of either gender can evolve into Glalie at Level 42, Snorunt evolves into Froslass only if it is **Female** and exposed to a **Dawn Stone**. This gender-locked evolution reinforces its lore connections to female spirits. Froslass belongs to the **Fairy** and **Mineral** Egg Groups.
