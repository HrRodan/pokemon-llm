## Identity & Lore
Impidimp (Pokedex #859) is the Wily Pokémon, a mischievous and small humanoid creature first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Primarily found in shadowed, mystical environments like the Glimwood Tangle, this pink-fleshed Pokémon thrives on negative energy. It is known to sneak into people's homes to steal things and cause general frustration, as it literally breathes in the "emanations" of annoyance and irritation produced by humans and other Pokémon through its large, sensitive nose. While Impidimp itself does not possess an alternate form, its final evolutionary stage, Grimmsnarl, is capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, transforming into a colossal, hair-covered entity. As the first evolutionary line to possess the dual **Dark/Fairy** typing, Impidimp occupies a unique ecological and competitive niche.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 45, Defense 30, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 40, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Prankster Utility / Special Attacker. While its base stats are low as a base-stage Pokémon, its access to high-priority status moves makes it a functional disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison, Steel, and Fairy**. It possesses a **double resistance (0.25x) to Dark** and a standard resistance to Ghost. Crucially, it is **immune to Dragon and Psychic** types, allowing it to switch into powerful legendary-tier moves with no damage.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its slightly higher Special Attack and its status as a premier disruptor, key moves include **Dark Pulse** and **Dazzling Gleam** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, alongside **Thunder Wave** and **Parting Shot** for team support and momentum.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Prankster:** Grants priority to status-category moves, allowing it to cripple faster opponents with status or screens before they can act.
    * **Frisk:** Allows the Pokémon to identify the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing vital tactical intelligence.
    * **Pickpocket (Hidden Ability):** Steals an opponent's held item if the opponent hits Impidimp with a contact move.

## Evolution & Biology
Impidimp is the initial form of a three-stage, male-only evolutionary line. It evolves into **Morgrem** starting at **Level 32**, which subsequently evolves into the powerful **Grimmsnarl** at **Level 42**. Its biology is characterized by its pointed ears, large eyes, and a tongue it often sticks out to mock its victims. Despite its small stature (0.4m), it is surprisingly hardy when dealing with psychic entities. It belongs to the **Fairy** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups and has a medium growth rate, requiring a standard amount of experience to reach its fully evolved potential.
