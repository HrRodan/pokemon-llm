## Identity & Lore
Tepig (Pokedex #498) is the **Fire Pig Pokémon**, introduced as the Fire-type Starter Pokémon for the **Unova region** in **Generation V**. This quadrupedal, orange-tinted Pokémon is characterized by the golden sphere on its tail and its ability to expel fireballs from its snout. According to ecological research, Tepig is agile, capable of deftly dodging enemy attacks before counter-attacking with flame. Outside of combat, it displays a docile nature, utilizing its fire breath to roast berries before consumption. While currently a pure Fire-type, it possesses the genetic potential to evolve into the dual-type Fire/Fighting heavyweight, **Emboar**.
