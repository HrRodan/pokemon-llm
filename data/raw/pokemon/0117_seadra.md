## Identity & Lore
Seadra (Pokédex #117) is known as the **Dragon Pokémon**. Introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**, this aquatic creature is characterized by its long snout and sharp, poisonous barbs. Though it is a pure Water-type, its classification foreshadows its eventual evolution into a Dragon-type. Seadra is capable of swimming backward by rapidly flapping its wing-like pectoral fins and stout tail to generate propulsion. It inhabits the sea, often hiding among coral reefs to ambush prey. Its spines can induce numbness or fainting in enemies upon contact, a biological trait reflected in its abilities.

    *   **Sniper:** Powers up moves if they become critical hits (increases damage modifier from 1.5x to 2.25x).

## Evolution & Biology
Seadra is the middle stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Horsea** starting at **Level 32**. To evolve into its final form, **Kingdra**, Seadra must be **traded while holding a Dragon Scale**. In the wild, Seadra can occasionally be found holding this specific evolution item. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Dragon** Egg Groups.
