## Identity & Lore
Honedge (Pokedex #679) is the Sword Pokémon, a dual Steel and Ghost-type spirit that first appeared in the Kalos region of Generation VI. It is said to be born when a departed human soul inhabits an ancient sword. This sentient blade is dangerous to handle; it possesses a blue ribbon-like sash that functions as an arm, which it uses to wrap around those who attempt to wield it, draining their life force completely. Its physical form consists of a silver blade, a dark hilt, and a distinctive brown scabbard adorned with intricate patterns. While Honedge itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolutionary stage, Aegislash, is renowned for its unique Stance Change ability, making this entire evolutionary line a cornerstone of competitive strategy and lore.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 80, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 37, Speed 28.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Attacker. With a high base Defense of 100, Honedge acts as a formidable physical wall in early-game or lower-tier competitive play.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses an incredible defensive profile, being **immune to Normal, Fighting, and Poison**. It further **resists Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**, and features a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Bug**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its superior Attack stat and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) options, Honedge excels with **Iron Head** for flinch potential, **Shadow Sneak** for essential priority recovery against faster threats, **Sacred Sword** to bypass opponent stat changes, and **Swords Dance** to boost its offensive presence to sweeping levels.
* **Abilities:** No Guard (Ensures that all moves used by or against the Pokémon have 100% accuracy). This allows Honedge to never miss its targets, though it becomes vulnerable to high-power, low-accuracy moves from opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Honedge is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Doublade** starting at Level 35, where the single sword splits into two sentient blades. To reach its final form, **Aegislash**, a **Dusk Stone** must be used on Doublade. Biologically, Honedge is a member of the **Mineral** egg group, and its growth is steady, requiring a hatch counter of 20. Despite its inorganic appearance, it is a predatory spirit that thrives on the energy of living beings, often found in ancient ruins or castle grounds where its blade form can blend in with its surroundings.
