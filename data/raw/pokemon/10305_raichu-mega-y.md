## Identity & Lore
Raichu-Mega-Y (Pokedex #10305) is the ascended form of the Mouse Pokémon, representing a specialized evolutionary peak first discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). While standard Raichu are known for their striking yellow fur and long, whip-like tails that serve as grounding rods for their immense electrical reserves, the Mega-Y variant manifests an extreme concentration of bio-electric energy. In its base form, Raichu can become aggressive if it stores too much electricity, often discharging it into the earth; however, this Mega Evolution allows it to channel that power with surgical precision. Beyond this specific form, Raichu is known to have a regional Alolan variant which gains the Psychic typing and the ability to ride its tail like a surfboard using telekinesis. 

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 100, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 160, Sp. Def 80, Speed 130.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a staggering Base 160 Special Attack and Elite 130 Speed, Raichu-Mega-Y is designed to outpace the majority of the competitive meta and deliver devastating one-hit knockouts.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground**, which poses a significant threat. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel** types. Due to its low physical Defense, it is highly susceptible to physical priority moves like Extreme Speed or Earthquake.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Special Attack and high Speed, its optimal kit includes **Thunderbolt** for reliable STAB damage, **Volt Switch** for pivoting and maintaining momentum, **Focus Blast** to coverage against Steel and Rock types, and **Nasty Plot** to boost its offensive presence to world-ending levels.
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-Y ability data is restricted, this lineage typically utilizes **Static**, which may paralyze opponents on contact, or **Lightning Rod**, which grants immunity to Electric moves while boosting Special Attack—further synergizing with its role as a premier special attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Raichu-Mega-Y is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Pichu**, a Baby Pokémon that matures and evolves into **Pikachu** once it has achieved a high level of friendship (220+ Base Happiness) with its trainer. Pikachu then transitions into **Raichu** when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. The Mega-Y form is a temporary combat transformation triggered by Mega Evolution mechanics. Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** egg groups, and its reproductive cycle is relatively fast with a hatch counter of 10. Despite its high power, its fragile frame (weighing only 26.0 kg) requires it to rely on its 130 Speed to avoid taking direct hits.
