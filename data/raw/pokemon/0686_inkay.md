## Identity & Lore
Inkay (Pokedex #686) is the Revolving Pokémon, a small, bioluminescent cephalopod originally discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This blue-colored aquatic entity is characterized by the light-emitting spots on its body; opponents who stare at these flashing lights become dazed, losing their will to fight, which allows Inkay to either escape or mount an attack. While primarily associated with coastal areas, it is a versatile creature that "swims" through the air using its tentacles. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Inkay is world-renowned for having one of the most unique physiological requirements for evolution in the Pokémon world, tied to its orientation.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 53, Attack 54, Defense 53, Sp. Atk 37, Sp. Def 46, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Contrary Physical Attacker. While its base stats are humble, Inkay functions as a unique setup sweeper in lower tiers or Little Cup formats.
* **Type Matchups:** It possesses a rare Dark/Psychic typing. It has a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug** and a weakness to **Fairy**. It is completely **immune to Psychic** attacks and resists no other types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical prowess and its signature ability, key moves include **Superpower** (which boosts stats instead of lowering them under Contrary), **Psycho Cut** (high-crit STAB), **Night Slash** (reliable Dark STAB), and **Topsy-Turvy** (a unique utility move that reverses an opponent's stat changes).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Contrary:** Its most competitive trait, which causes all stat changes to have the opposite effect (e.g., the Attack and Defense drop from Superpower becomes an Attack and Defense boost).
    * **Suction Cups:** Prevents the Pokémon from being forced out of battle by moves like Roar or Whirlwind.
    * **Infiltrator (Hidden):** Allows Inkay to bypass the effects of Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, Mist, and Substitute.

## Evolution & Biology
Inkay is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Malamar** starting at Level 30. This evolution is highly specialized, requiring the trainer to hold their device upside down during the level-up process to trigger the transformation. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 2** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. Despite its aquatic appearance, it is frequently found in non-aquatic environments, suggesting a highly adaptable respiratory system.
