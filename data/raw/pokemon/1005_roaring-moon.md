## Identity & Lore
Roaring Moon (Pokedex #1005) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mysterious and formidable creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is categorized as an "Ancient Paradox" Pokémon, bearing a striking and uncanny resemblance to the Mega Evolution of Salamence. According to records in the Scarlet Book, it is said to resemble a creature described in an expedition journal that witnessed it scattering feathers while flying in a savage manner. Its design features massive, crescent-shaped wings with red and blue underside patterns, hinting at a prehistoric lineage far more feral than its modern-day counterpart. While it is not a Mega Evolution itself, its biology seems intrinsically linked to the energy that triggers such transformations. This elusive beast is typically found in the deepest, most secluded caverns of Area Zero, specifically within the Great Crater of Paldea.

## Evolution & Biology
Roaring Moon is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. As a Paradox Pokémon, it exists outside the standard evolutionary lines of the modern era, though it is biologically related to the Bagon, Shelgon, and Salamence line found in the Kanto and Hoenn regions. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is a quadrupedal, draconic creature of immense weight (380.0 kg), maintaining a high base experience yield of 295, reflecting its status as a top-tier apex predator within the Paldean ecosystem.
