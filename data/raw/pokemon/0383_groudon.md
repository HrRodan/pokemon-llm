## Evolution & Biology
Groudon is a Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** group and cannot breed. Unlike most Pokémon, its form change into Primal Groudon is triggered by item possession (Red Orb) rather than leveling or traditional evolution stones.
