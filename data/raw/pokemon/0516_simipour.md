## Identity & Lore
Simipour (Pokedex #516) is the Geyser Pokémon, a spirited Water-type creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Recognizable by its cheerful disposition and the distinctive cream-colored tuft atop its head, this Pokémon is a master of hydraulic regulation; it stores a vast reservoir of water within its head tuft which it uses to spray high-pressure streams at its foes. When its internal reserves run low, it exhibits a unique biological behavior, using its long, specialized tail to siphon water from nearby sources to replenish itself. As a member of the "Elemental Monkeys" trio—alongside Simisage and Simisear—it serves as the balanced Water-type counterpart. While it currently possesses no Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its versatile anatomy allows it to thrive in various aquatic and terrestrial habitats throughout the Unova mainland.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 98, Defense 63, Sp. Atk 98, Sp. Def 63, Speed 101.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Attacker. With perfectly balanced offensive stats and a Speed tier that outpaces base-100 threats, Simipour functions as a versatile offensive pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass and Electric** types. It effectively **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and diverse movepool, Simipour excels with **Scald** (which offers a crucial burn chance to compensate for its low Defense), **Ice Beam** for essential coverage against Grass and Dragon types, **Grass Knot** to dismantle heavy Water-type rivals, and **Focus Blast** for high-intensity damage against Steel and Rock types. 
* **Abilities:** **Gluttony** (causes the Pokémon to consume held Berries, such as the Oran or Rindo Berries often found on this species, at 50% HP instead of 25%); **Torrent** (Hidden Ability: boosts the power of Water-type moves by 50% when Simipour's health falls below one-third, turning it into a desperate but dangerous sweeper).

## Evolution & Biology
Simipour is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Panpour** when exposed to a **Water Stone**. This transformation significantly enhances its offensive capabilities and grants it a more upright, humanoid posture. Biologically, it is highly compatible with a wide range of mammalian Pokémon, belonging to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group. Trainers should note its Hatch Counter of 20, which is standard for most elemental species in the Unova region. Its ability to hold items like the **Rindo Berry** suggests a biological adaptation to mitigate its natural weakness to Grass-type energy.
