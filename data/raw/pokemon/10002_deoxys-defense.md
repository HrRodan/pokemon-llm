## Identity & Lore
Deoxys Defense Form (Pokedex #10002) is the DNA Pokémon, an extraterrestrial entity originating from Generation III (Hoenn). It was born when the DNA of a space virus underwent a sudden mutation upon exposure to a high-intensity laser beam. This specific form represents Deoxys's molecular structure shifting into a reinforced, bulky configuration designed to withstand extreme atmospheric re-entry and devastating physical impacts. Its body is primarily red with a humanoid shape, featuring a prominent crystalline organ in its chest that functions as its brain and core. While this data focuses on its Defense Form, Deoxys is famously versatile, capable of shifting into its Normal, Attack, and Speed forms when exposed to specific meteorites found in regions like Sinnoh, Kanto, and Hoenn. Despite being a singular species with no Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its mythical status and ability to manipulate its own genetic code make it one of the most adaptable entities in the Pokémon world.

## Evolution & Biology
Deoxys-Defense is a member of a unique, single-stage mythical lineage that does not evolve. Instead of traditional evolution, it undergoes "Forme Change." It can transition between its four known states—Normal, Attack, Defense, and Speed—by interacting with cosmic radiation or specific meteorites. Biologically, it is genderless and belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. It has a **Slow** growth rate and requires a staggering amount of experience to reach its full potential. Its biology is entirely alien; it does not breathe or eat in the traditional sense, relying instead on the energy stored within its central core. It is notoriously difficult to capture, possessing a capture rate of 3, the lowest possible value, reflecting its elusive and powerful nature.
