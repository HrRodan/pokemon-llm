## Identity & Lore
Delibird (Pokedex #225) is the Delivery Pokémon, a dual-type Ice/Flying creature introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Residing in harsh, snowy **mountain** peaks, this red, penguin-like avian is easily recognized by its hollow tail, which functions as a sack to carry food. Delibird is biologically driven by altruism; it spends its days gathering food and is famous in folklore for saving lost travelers by sharing its provisions. While Delibird itself does not evolve, it shares a striking resemblance to the **Paradox Pokémon** known as **Iron Bundle** from the Paldea region, suggesting a futuristic connection.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 55, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 45, Speed 75.
*   **Archetype:** Niche Utility Support / Hazard Remover.
*   **Type Matchups:** As an Ice/Flying type, it suffers from a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock-type** attacks (making it highly vulnerable to Stealth Rock). It is also weak to **Electric, Steel, and Fire**. However, it resists **Grass and Bug**, and possesses a total **Immunity to Ground-type** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Speed and slightly higher Special Attack, Delibird functions best when utilizing unique coverage and field control moves such as **Freeze-Dry** (which hits Water-types super effectively), **Ice Beam**, **Spikes** (for hazard setting), and **Rapid Spin** (to clear hazards).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Vital Spirit:** Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep.
    *   **Hustle:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% but lowers accuracy by 20% (enabling a physical set despite lower base stats).
    *   **Insomnia (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep (functionally identical to Vital Spirit).

## Evolution & Biology
Delibird is a stand-alone Pokémon with no evolutionary predecessors or successors. It is obtained directly through capture in the wild or breeding.
