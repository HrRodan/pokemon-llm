## Identity & Lore
Monferno (Pokedex #391) is the Playful Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A bipedal, primate-like creature, it possesses brown fur with a distinct blue pattern masking its face and a collar of white fur around its neck. A flame burns constantly at the tip of its long tail, serving as both a weapon and an intimidation display; Monferno will stretch this tail fire to make itself appear larger to potential predators. Known for its acrobatic agility, it utilizes ceilings and walls to launch aerial attacks, controlling the position of its tail flame to keep foes at a distance. As the middle evolution of the Sinnoh Fire-type starter, it serves as a bridge between the youthful Chimchar and the martial arts master Infernape.
