## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Eevee (Pokedex #10205) is the Gigantamax form of the Evolution Pokémon, a unique biological phenomenon first discovered in the Galar region. Originally hailing from Generation I (Kanto), Eevee is famous for its irregular genetic code, which allows it to mutate and adapt to various environments when exposed to elemental radiation from stones. In its Gigantamax state, Eevee grows to a staggering height of 18 meters, becoming exponentially more fluffy; the fur around its neck becomes so voluminous and soft that any enemy who gets caught in it loses the will to fight, becoming enamored with Eevee. While standard Eevee are often found in urban habitats, the Gigantamax factor is a rare trait that prevents the Pokémon from evolving, instead granting it the power to perform the signature move **G-Max Cuddle**, which inflicts damage and infatuates all opponents of the opposite gender.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 55, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 65, Speed 55.
* **Archetype:** Low-Tier Bulk Support / Infatuation Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost** types. As a pure Normal-type, it has no resistances.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical Attack and its signature Gigantamax utility, key moves include **Double-Edge** (high-powered STAB), **Last Resort** (massive damage once other moves are used), **Quick Attack** (priority finishing), and **Bite** (flinch chance and coverage).
* **Abilities:** **Run Away** (enables a sure getaway from wild encounters); **Adaptability** (increases the power of Normal-type moves from 1.5x to 2x, making it a deceptive offensive threat); **Anticipation** (a hidden ability that alerts the Pokémon to the presence of dangerous moves like Fighting-type attacks or One-Hit KO moves).

## Evolution & Biology
Eevee is the core of a massive 8-stage branched evolutionary line, though a specimen with the Gigantamax factor is biologically locked out of the evolution process to maintain its G-Max potential. Standard Eevee can evolve into **Vaporeon** when exposed to a Water Stone, **Jolteon** via a Thunder Stone, or **Flareon** via a Fire Stone. In regions like Johto and beyond, it evolves into **Espeon** (High Friendship during the day) or **Umbreon** (High Friendship at night). Exposure to a Leaf Stone (or Mossy Rock) produces **Leafeon**, while an Ice Stone (or Icy Rock) results in **Glaceon**. Finally, Eevee evolves into the Fairy-type **Sylveon** when leveled up with high friendship while knowing a Fairy-type move. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and has a hatch counter of 35, making it a relatively common target for competitive breeding.
