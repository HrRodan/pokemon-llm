## Identity & Lore
Hippopotas (Pokedex #449) is the Hippo Pokémon, a Ground-type creature originally discovered in the **Sinnoh** region (**Generation IV**). Adapted for survival in harsh, arid environments, this brown, quadrupedal Pokémon possesses a unique biological mechanism where it expels grainy sand from its pores instead of perspiration to protect its skin from heat and germs. Hippopotas is notable for its sexual dimorphism, with males and females displaying inverted color patterns on their bodies. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is highly valued for its natural ability to manipulate weather conditions upon entering the battlefield.
