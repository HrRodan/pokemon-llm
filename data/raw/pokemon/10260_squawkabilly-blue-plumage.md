## Identity & Lore
Squawkabilly (Blue Plumage) (Pokedex #10260) is the Parrot Pokémon, originally discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This specific variant is distinguished by its vibrant blue feathers and its signature pompadour-like crest, which gives it a distinct "street-tough" aesthetic. Preferring urban environments over the deep wilderness, Blue Plumage Squawkabilly are highly social but fiercely territorial, forming organized flocks exclusively with others of the same color. They are known for their raucous cries and the intense squabbles that break out when different colored flocks overlap in city centers. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its multiple plumage colors (Green, Blue, Yellow, and White) represent distinct sub-communities within the species, with the Blue and Green variants sharing the same aggressive ability pool.

## Evolution & Biology
Squawkabilly is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. Despite its lack of evolution, it is biologically diverse due to its plumage variations. The Blue Plumage variety belongs to the **Flying** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, reflecting its relatively fast development. Its biology is centered around aerial mobility and vocal intimidation, using its strong wings for moves like **Dual Wingbeat** and its loud voice for moves like **Hyper Voice** or **Parting Shot**. In competitive breeding, its "Slow-then-Very-Fast" growth rate means it requires significant investment early on but reaches its peak potential rapidly at higher levels.
