## Identity & Lore
Rotom (Pokédex #479) is the Plasma Pokémon, a mischievous Electric/Ghost-type entity first discovered in the Old Chateau of the **Sinnoh** region (Generation IV). Composed entirely of plasma, this reddish, ball-shaped Pokémon possesses the unique ability to infiltrate and possess electronic devices to wreak havoc. While the data provided reflects its base form, Rotom is renowned for its **Forme Change** capabilities; by possessing specific household appliances (ovens, washing machines, refrigerators, fans, and lawnmowers), it can transform into Rotom-Heat, Rotom-Wash, Rotom-Frost, Rotom-Fan, or Rotom-Mow, changing its secondary typing and boosting its defensive statistics significantly.
