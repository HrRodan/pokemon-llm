## Identity & Lore
Slowpoke (Pokedex #079) is the Water/Psychic-type Dopey Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This pink, quadrupedal creature is defined by its incredibly sluggish behavior and vacant expression. Lore indicates that its sensory systems are so delayed that it takes approximately five seconds for it to feel pain after being attacked. Slowpoke is often found at the **water's edge**, where it uses its sweet-tasting tail as a lure to fish for prey; however, it often forgets what it is doing due to its poor memory. While this profile details the standard Kantonian form, Slowpoke possesses a Psychic-type regional variant known as **Galarian Slowpoke**. Additionally, its evolved form, Slowbro, is capable of **Mega Evolution**.
