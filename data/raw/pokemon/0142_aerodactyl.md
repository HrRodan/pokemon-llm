## Identity & Lore
Aerodactyl (Pokedex #142) is the ferocious **Fossil Pokémon** resurrected from genetic material found in **Old Amber**. Originating from the **Kanto** region (Generation I), this prehistoric apex predator once dominated the skies of the dinosaur era. It is characterized by its serrated, saw-like fangs which it uses to tear at the throat of its prey. While it typically inhabits mountainous terrain, its resurrection is exclusively the result of modern science. Though it has no standard evolutionary line, Aerodactyl is capable of **Mega Evolution** using the Aerodactylite, transforming into Mega Aerodactyl, where its body becomes covered in jagged stone spikes.

## Evolution & Biology
Aerodactyl is a standalone species and is part of a **1-stage evolutionary line**; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. In most regions, it can only be obtained by reviving a Fossil (specifically **Old Amber**) at a research laboratory. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a slow hatch cycle (35 cycles), reflecting its ancient and rare nature.
