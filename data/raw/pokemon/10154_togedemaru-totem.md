## Identity & Lore
Totem Togedemaru (Pokedex #10154) is the Roly-Poly Pokémon, a specialized and significantly larger variant of the standard Togedemaru found in the Alola region of Generation VII. This specific form is recognized for its role as a Totem Pokémon during the Alola Island Challenge, specifically guarding the trial of Sophocles at Mount Hokulani. Its physiology is defined by gray fur and long, needle-like hairs on its back; while these spines normally lie flat, they stand on end to impale attackers when the Pokémon is agitated or threatened. As an Electric/Steel type, it acts as the Alolan "Pikaclone," utilizing its metallic hide to conduct and store electricity. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its Totem status grants it a distinct aura that boosts its stats at the beginning of battle in its native habitat.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 98, Defense 63, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 73, Speed 96.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Pivot / Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground** and is also weak to **Fire and Fighting**. However, it boasts an incredible list of resistances, including **Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**, and is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** With a significantly higher Attack than Special Attack, Totem Togedemaru excels with physical contact moves and utility. Key moves include **Zing Zap** (its signature STAB move with a high flinch rate), **Iron Head** (STAB with flinch synergy), **Nuzzle** (guaranteed paralysis on contact), and **U-turn** (for maintaining offensive momentum).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Iron Barbs:** Damages attackers that use contact moves, synergizing with its spiny lore.
    * **Lightning Rod:** Provides immunity to Electric moves and draws them in during doubles, boosting Special Attack (though the boost is less useful given its stat spread).
    * **Sturdy (Hidden Ability):** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full health, a vital safeguard against its 4x Ground weakness.

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Togedemaru is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is a unique, oversized individual within the Togedemaru lineage. Biologically, it is a highly social Pokémon that huddles with others of its kind to share electrical energy, though the Totem variant often stands as a solitary protector. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** Egg Groups, and while this specific Totem form is usually obtained through special in-game events (like collecting Totem Stickers), it shares the breeding characteristics of its smaller kin, requiring a Hatch Counter of approximately 10 cycles.
