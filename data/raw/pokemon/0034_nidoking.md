## Identity & Lore
Nidoking (Pokédex #034) is the Drill Pokémon, an imposing Poison/Ground-type creature originally discovered in the Generation I (Kanto) region. Standing upright on powerful hind legs, this purple, armored behemoth is a terrifying force in its grassland habitats. Nidoking is characterized by its thick, spiny hide and a long, powerful tail, which it uses to smash, constrict, and break the bones of its prey before engaging its horn. While it shares a biological connection with the Nidoqueen line, Nidoking is exclusively male and is known for its extreme aggression and physical dominance.
