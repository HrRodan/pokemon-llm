## Identity & Lore
Qwilfish (Pokedex #211) is the Balloon Pokémon, a distinctive Water and Poison-type creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its spherical, gray body covered in toxic spikes, Qwilfish resides primarily in the sea. To defend itself or attack predators, it drinks over 2.6 gallons of water at once to inflate its body, launching its poisonous quills outward. While this profile details the standard form, the species possesses a notable regional variant known as **Hisuian Qwilfish** (Dark/Poison), which was discovered in the ancient Hisui region.

## Evolution & Biology
The standard Johtonian Qwilfish is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve. However, biologically related **Hisuian Qwilfish** are capable of evolving into **Overqwil**. In that specific regional line, evolution occurs when the Pokémon levels up after using the move **Barb Barrage** in the Strong Style 20 times. Qwilfish belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and requires a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
