## Identity & Lore
Eternamax Eternatus (Pokedex #10190) is the "Gigantic Pokémon" and serves as the terrifying source of the Dynamax phenomenon within the Galar region (Generation VIII). This form represents Eternatus at its absolute peak of power, having absorbed an overwhelming amount of energy from the Galar land, causing its appearance to shift into a massive, celestial-like serpentine entity encircling a glowing core. While its base form is already a formidable legendary, the Eternamax state is the largest Pokémon known to exist, reaching a staggering 100 meters in height. Historically, this form is associated with the "Darkest Day," an ancient event where Galar was nearly destroyed by the sudden overflow of energy. Although it does not possess a traditional Gigantamax form available to players in standard gameplay, this specific state is encountered as a world-ending boss that requires the combined strength of Zacian, Zamazenta, and the player to overcome.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 255, Attack 115, Defense 250, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 250, Speed 130.
* **Archetype:** Ultimate Defensive Juggernaut. With astronomical 255 HP and dual 250 Defense stats, this Pokémon possesses the highest effective bulk in the entire history of the franchise, making it virtually impossible to one-shot even with super-effective moves.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Psychic, Ice, and Dragon**. On the defensive side, it resists Fighting, Poison, Bug, Fire, Water, and Electric, and possesses a **Double Resistance (4x) to Grass**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack and its role as an immovable object, its optimal moveset includes **Eternabeam** (its signature high-damage finisher), **Dynamax Cannon** (which deals double damage to Dynamaxed targets), **Sludge Wave** (primary Poison-type STAB), and **Recover** (to maintain its massive health pool).
* **Abilities:** Pressure (Forces the opponent to expend twice the usual PP for every move used, which, combined with its massive defensive stats, allows Eternatus to easily stall out an opponent's resources).

## Evolution & Biology
Eternatus is a standalone legendary Pokémon and does not belong to a traditional evolutionary line. It is part of a single-stage chain, though it undergoes the "Eternamax" transformation during the climax of the Galar region's narrative when it becomes overcharged with energy. Biologically, it is an extraterrestrial entity that arrived on Earth inside a meteor thousands of years ago. It belongs to the **No Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its core is its most vital organ, acting as an infinite battery that radiates Galar Particles, the energy required for other Pokémon to Dynamax or Gigantamax. Its biology is unique in that it has a weight of 0.0 kg in this form, suggesting its massive body is composed more of pure energy and light than physical matter.
