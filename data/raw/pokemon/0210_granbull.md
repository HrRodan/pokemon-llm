## Identity & Lore
Granbull (Pokedex #210) is the Fairy Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). While originally classified as a Normal-type, it was reclassified as a pure Fairy-type in Generation VI. Distinguished by its heavy, purple stature and prominent lower jaw, Granbull possesses a menacing appearance that contradicts its actual temperament. It is naturally timid and easily spooked, often avoiding conflict in its urban habitats. However, when cornered or attacked, it flails violent to fend off aggressors. Unlike many of its peers, Granbull does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form.
