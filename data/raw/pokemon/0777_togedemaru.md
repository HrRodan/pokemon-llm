## Identity & Lore
Togedemaru (Pokedex #777) is the Roly-Poly Pokémon, a dual Electric and Steel-type first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This small, spherical creature is characterized by its gray, metallic fur and a distinct needle-like hair on its back that acts as a lightning rod. Normally, its spiny fur remains flat and soft to the touch, but when it becomes agitated or prepares for battle, the needles stand on end to stab and electrocute attackers. In the wild, Togedemaru are known to gather in groups during thunderstorms, standing with their needles raised to draw in lightning and store energy. While it does not have a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, it serves as the "Pikachu variant" for the Alola region, often seen accompanying Trial Captain Sophocles.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 98, Defense 63, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 73, Speed 96.
* **Archetype:** Physical Pivot / Disruptor. With a solid Speed tier and a respectable Attack stat, Togedemaru excels at applying pressure and utility before switching out.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**, and is also weak to **Fire and Fighting**. However, its Steel typing provides a massive array of resistances, including **Flying, Steel, Rock, Bug, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**, alongside a complete immunity to **Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Physical Attack and Speed, Togedemaru’s most effective moves include **Zing Zap** (STAB with a high flinch chance), **Iron Head** (STAB with flinch chance), **Nuzzle** (guaranteed paralysis utility), and **U-turn** (for maintaining offensive momentum).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Iron Barbs:** Damages attackers who make direct contact, punishing physical sweepers.
    * **Lightning Rod:** Draws in and negates Electric-type moves, boosting Special Attack (though Togedemaru rarely uses this boost, the immunity is vital for team support).
    * **Sturdy (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full HP, a crucial safety net given its 4x Ground weakness.

## Evolution & Biology
Togedemaru is a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Field (Ground) and Fairy** Egg Groups, and while it has a relatively high capture rate, it is prized by trainers for its unique defensive typing. Biologically, its ability to curl into a ball allows it to use moves like **Rollout** and **Gyro Ball** effectively, using its weight and metallic hide as a weapon. Its diet consists largely of electricity, and it is known to follow lightning strikes to recharge its internal batteries.
