## Identity & Lore
Milotic (Pokédex #350) is the Tender Pokémon introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Famed as the most beautiful Pokémon in the world, it possesses a pink and cream-colored serpentine body with scales that shimmer in rainbow colors, changing depending on the viewing angle. It resides in the **waters-edge** of large lakes and is known to appear before people during times of conflict to calm their hearts and quell fighting. A stark contrast to its pre-evolution, Milotic serves as a thematic counterpart to Gyarados, representing grace and restoration rather than destruction. While it does not possess Mega or Gigantamax forms, its competitive prowess and lore make it a "pseudo-legendary" figure in terms of popularity and rarity.

## Evolution & Biology
Milotic is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line famous for the drastic transformation between forms. It evolves from **Feebas**. The evolution is unique as it can be triggered by two distinct methods depending on the game generation: traditionally, when Feebas is leveled up after achieving a high **Beauty condition** (via Pokéblocks or Poffins), or when **traded while holding a Prism Scale**. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Dragon** Egg Groups.
