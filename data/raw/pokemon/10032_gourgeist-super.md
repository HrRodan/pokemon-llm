## Identity & Lore
Super Size Gourgeist (Pokedex #711) is the Pumpkin Pokémon, a haunting dual Ghost and Grass-type creature first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This specific variant is the largest of its four known sizes (Small, Average, Large, and Super), characterized by its immense physical bulk and eerie presence. Its biology features a pumpkin-like lower body with a glowing face and long, hair-like arms extending from its head. According to legend, these Pokémon wander town streets on the night of the new moon, singing in eerie voices; anyone who hears their haunting melody is struck by a curse. While Gourgeist does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its Super Size variant is distinguished by its unique base stat distribution, trading agility for massive physical power and durability.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 100, Defense 122, Sp. Atk 58, Sp. Def 75, Speed 54.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Attacker. Its high natural Defense and respectable HP allow it to survive powerful physical hits while retaliating with heavy damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost, Dark, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** and possesses complete **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its high Attack and utility, key moves for this Pokémon include **Poltergeist** (a devastating Ghost STAB), **Power Whip** (its strongest physical Grass move), **Shadow Sneak** (essential priority to overcome its low Speed), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to burn opponents and further augment its massive physical Defense).
* **Abilities:** **Pickup** (allows the Pokémon to find items outside of battle or retrieve used items); **Frisk** (identifies the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing vital competitive intelligence); **Insomnia** (Hidden Ability that prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep, making it a hard counter to Sleep-inducing strategies like Spore or Sleep Powder).

## Evolution & Biology
Super Size Gourgeist is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pumpkaboo** when the Pokémon is **traded between trainers**. A unique biological trait of this species is that its size—and the corresponding stat modifications—are permanent and inherited through breeding; a Super Size Gourgeist will always produce Super Size Pumpkaboo offspring. It belongs to the **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Group and is often found in eerie, autumnal environments. Despite its frightening lore of singing curses, it is a popular Pokémon during harvest festivals in the Kalos and Galar regions, often found carrying **Miracle Seeds** to boost its botanical powers.
