## Identity & Lore
Primarina (Pokedex #730) is the Soloist Pokémon, a majestic dual Water and Fairy-type creature that serves as the final evolution of the Alolan starter Popplio. Introduced in Generation VII (Alola), this Pokémon is renowned for its operatic elegance and its ability to weaponize song. Its body is primarily white and blue, featuring a long, seal-like tail and a mane of flowing blue hair held by pearl-like ornaments. Primarina controls massive balloons of water using the ultrasonic waves of its voice; the moonlight reflects off these balloons to create a glittering, magical spectacle. These melodies are not innate but are learned from others of its kind, passed down through generations within their coastal colonies. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famous for its exclusive Z-Move, **Oceanic Operetta**, which it performs by manipulating a gargantuan water spirit with its singing.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 74, Defense 74, Sp. Atk 126, Sp. Def 116, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Special Wallbreaker. Primarina excels as a slow but powerful offensive threat with significant natural bulk on the special side.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass, Electric, Poison, and Steel**. It provides excellent defensive utility by **resisting Fire, Water, Ice, Fighting, Bug, and Dark**, while maintaining a total **Immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Special Attack and signature status, its optimal moveset includes **Moonblast** (high-power Fairy STAB), **Sparkling Aria** (its signature Water-type move that also heals the target's burns), **Hydro Pump** (for maximum Water-type damage), and **Psychic** or **Ice Beam** for essential coverage against Poison and Grass types. **Calm Mind** is also a vital utility move for boosting its already impressive special stats.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Torrent:** Increases the power of Water-type moves by 50% when Primarina's health drops below one-third.
    * **Liquid Voice (Hidden Ability):** Converts all sound-based moves used by the Pokémon (such as Hyper Voice or Perish Song) into Water-type moves, allowing it to bypass certain defensive checks and gain STAB on vocal attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Primarina is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Popplio**, the Sea Lion Pokémon, which evolves into **Brionne** starting at Level 17. The transition to the final form, **Primarina**, occurs upon reaching Level 34. Biologically, it is highly dependent on its throat health, as any injury to its vocal cords can prevent it from controlling its water balloons or battling effectively. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Field** (Ground) Egg Groups, and breeders should note it has a hatch counter of 15, making it a moderately paced Pokémon to raise from an egg. Its medium-slow growth rate reflects the disciplined training required to master its complex vocal combat style.
