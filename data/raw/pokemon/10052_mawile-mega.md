## Identity & Lore
Mega Mawile (Pokedex #10052) is the Deceiver Pokémon, a powerful transformation of the Hoenn-native Mawile achieved through Mega Evolution. Originally discovered in the caves of the Hoenn region (Generation III), this Steel/Fairy-type Pokémon is characterized by its deceptive appearance; it uses a docile, humanoid face to lure opponents into a false sense of security before striking with the massive, predatory jaws attached to the back of its head. In its Mega Evolved state, Mawile’s single steel horn splits into two gargantuan, sentient-looking jaws with increased biting power. These "horns" are actually transformed steel skin, capable of crunching through iron beams. While Mawile does not have a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution is considered one of the most significant power spikes in competitive history due to the sheer force exerted by its twin jaws.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 105, Defense 125, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 95, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank & Wallbreaker. Despite its low base Speed, its massive Defense and Ability make it a terrifying offensive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire and Ground**. It possesses an incredible defensive profile, providing **Immunities to Dragon and Poison**, and a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**. It also resists Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Rock, Dark, and Fairy types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its immense physical power and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), key moves include **Play Rough** (high-damage Fairy STAB), **Iron Head** (reliable Steel STAB with a flinch chance), **Sucker Punch** (essential priority to bypass its low Speed), and **Knock Off** or **Swords Dance** for utility and setup.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Mawile is a temporary Mega Evolution of Mawile, triggered when it holds a Mawilite during battle. Mawile itself is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species through traditional leveling. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** Egg Groups, and while it appears small at 1.0 meter, its weight of 23.5 kg is concentrated heavily in its metallic jaws. Biologically, it is a patient hunter that frequents dark caverns, using its second set of "eyes" on its horns to monitor its surroundings while its primary face maintains a harmless facade. Its growth rate is categorized as "Fast," allowing it to reach its full combat potential quickly under a trainer's care.
