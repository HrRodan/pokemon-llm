## Identity & Lore
Baltoy (Pokédex #343) is the Clay Doll Pokémon, an artificial construct seemingly animated by a mysterious power. Introduced in Generation III (Hoenn), this dual-type Ground/Psychic entity resembles ancient clay figurines, specifically the *shakoki-dogu* of historical Japan. Baltoy moves by spinning on its single pointed foot, maintaining balance through continuous rotation. Lore indicates it was discovered in ancient ruins, with primitive wall paintings depicting it living alongside humans in civilizations long past. While it has no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its connection to ancient history links it thematically to the mysteries of the Hoenn region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 40, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 70, Speed 55.
*   **Archetype:** Defensive Utility / Hazard Control.
*   **Type Matchups:** Baltoy possesses a high number of weaknesses, being susceptible to **Water, Grass, Ice, Bug, Ghost, and Dark** types. However, it **resists Fighting, Poison, Rock, and Psychic** damage.
*   **Abilities:** **Levitate** (Makes the Pokémon immune to Ground-type moves and entry hazards like Spikes and Toxic Spikes). This ability provides a critical immunity to Ground-type attacks, which would typically be neutral damage, and enhances its role as a hazard remover.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its equal offensive stats but low base power, Baltoy relies on utility and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) coverage. Key moves include:
    *   **Rapid Spin:** Essential for clearing entry hazards from the field.
    *   **Stealth Rock:** Allows Baltoy to set up its own entry hazards to chip away at opponents.
    *   **Earth Power:** A reliable Special Ground-type STAB move that hits harder than Earthquake due to burn mechanics often lowering physical attack.
    *   **Psychic:** A consistent Special Psychic-type STAB move for handling Fighting or Poison types.

## Evolution & Biology
Baltoy is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Claydol** upon reaching **Level 36**. Biologically, it is comprised of clay and belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group. Baltoy is genderless and typically found in rough terrains or deserts, reflecting the arid environments where ancient relics are often unearthed.
