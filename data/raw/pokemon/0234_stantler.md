## Identity & Lore
Stantler (Pokedex #234) is the Big Horn Pokémon, a pure Normal-type creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in deep forests, this brown, quadrupedal Pokémon is distinguished by its magnificent, curved antlers. According to lore, these antlers subtly alter the flow of air to create a strange space where reality is distorted, causing dizziness and confusion in those who stare at them. While Stantler does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it holds a unique ancestral connection to the ancient Hisui region, where it serves as a rideable mount and is capable of evolving into the distinct Pokémon, Wyrdeer.
