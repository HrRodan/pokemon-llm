## Identity & Lore
Trevenant (Pokedex #709) is the Elder Tree Pokémon, a haunting Grass/Ghost-type first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. Standing at 1.5 meters tall, this spectral entity resembles a decaying, multi-limbed tree with a single red eye peering from a dark knot in its trunk. It is a terrifying guardian of the woods, possessing the supernatural ability to control trees at will through its root-like nervous system. Lore states that Trevenant is fiercely protective of its habitat, using its branches to trap anyone who dares to harm the forest so they can never find their way out. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, it is often seen as the spiritual counterpart to Gourgeist, representing the more somber and vengeful side of forest spirits. Biologically, it is said that Trevenant are born when spirits inhabit rotten tree stumps, particularly the spirits of children who passed away while lost in the woods, a trait shared with its pre-evolution, Phantump.

## Evolution & Biology
Trevenant is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Phantump** when the Pokémon is **traded between trainers**. This unique evolution method often requires a reliable partner to trigger the transformation from the small stump spirit into the towering elder tree. Trevenant belongs to the **Plant and Indeterminate** egg groups, suggesting a dual nature as both a botanical organism and a shapeless spectral entity. With a hatch counter of 20, breeders can expect a moderate incubation period before a Phantump emerges. In the wild, Trevenant are known to be kind to the creatures that live in their shadows, effectively acting as a living ecosystem while remaining a nightmare to lumberjacks and forest clearers.
