## Identity & Lore
Herdier (Pokedex #507) is the Loyal Dog Pokémon, a dedicated **Normal-type** introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**. Distinguished by its thick, gray, cape-like fur, this coat is exceptionally hard and acts as natural armor, significantly decreasing the physical damage it receives during battle. Highly intelligent and obedient, Herdier is deeply connected to human society; it strictly follows its Trainer's orders and is often utilized for its tracking abilities. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the intermediate stage of a powerful regional hound line common in Unova.

## Combat Profile

*   **Archetype:** Physical Brawler / Support Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting-type** attacks. It possesses a valuable **immunity to Ghost-type** moves but has no natural resistances.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Intimidate:** Lowers the opposing Pokémon's Attack stat upon entering battle, providing immediate defensive utility.
    *   **Sand Rush:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during a sandstorm, allowing it to function as a fast sweeper in weather teams.
    *   **Scrappy (Hidden):** Allows Normal and Fighting-type moves to hit Ghost-type Pokémon, negating its usual inability to touch them with STAB attacks.
