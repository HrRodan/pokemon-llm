## Identity & Lore
Sewaddle (Pokedex #540) is the Sewing Pokémon, a dual Bug and Grass-type creature first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Distinguished by its vibrant yellow body and the characteristic leaf hood that envelops its head, Sewaddle is known for a unique symbiotic relationship with its evolved form, Leavanny. Upon hatching, a Leavanny will fashion a set of leafy "clothes" for the young Sewaddle, providing it with both warmth and protection. When it sleeps, it instinctively tucks its head into this leafy hood for safety. While primarily found in forests and lush meadows, Sewaddle is highly regarded for its industrious nature, often using its silk to stitch leaves together. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Leavanny, remains a staple of the Unovan ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 53, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 60, Speed 42.
* **Archetype:** Physical Bulky Support / Hazard Setter. In competitive Little Cup formats, Sewaddle functions as a defensive pivot and utility provider due to its surprisingly high base Defense for an unevolved Pokémon.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fire and Flying**. It is also **weak to Poison, Bug, Rock, and Ice**, while maintaining **resistances to Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, and Fighting**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its higher physical Attack and utility kit, key moves include **Sticky Web** (to reduce the speed of incoming opponents), **Seed Bomb** (a high-damage Physical STAB move), **Lunge** (to lower the opponent's Attack), and **Bug Bite** (to deal damage and consume an opponent's held Berry).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Swarm:** Boosts the power of Bug-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third.
    * **Chlorophyll:** Doubles its Speed stat in harsh sunlight, potentially turning it into a fast utility lead.
    * **Overcoat (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from weather-related damage (Sandstorm/Hail) and powder-based moves like Spore or Sleep Powder.

## Evolution & Biology
Sewaddle is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Swadloon** starting at **Level 20**, adopting a more reclusive, leaf-wrapped appearance. To reach its final form, **Leavanny**, the Swadloon must be **leveled up with high friendship (220 or higher)**, reflecting the nurturing lore of the species. Sewaddle belongs to the **Bug Egg Group** and is often found carrying a **Mental Herb**, which allows it to ignore move-binding effects like Taunt or Encore for one turn. Biologically, it is a "medium-slow" grower, requiring significant care and experience to reach its full potential as a guardian of the forest.
