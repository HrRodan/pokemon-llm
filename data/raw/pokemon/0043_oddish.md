## Identity & Lore
Oddish (Pokedex #043) is the Weed Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Poison creature originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This small, nocturnal Pokémon is recognizable by its blue, bulb-like body and the large green leaves sprouting from its head. Biologically, Oddish mimics a plant bulb; during the day, it buries its face in the ground to absorb nutrients from the soil using its entire body, appearing indistinguishable from common weeds in its **grassland** habitat. It becomes active at night, wandering to sow its seeds under the moonlight. While unassuming, Oddish is the base form for two powerful final evolutions: the poisonous Vileplume and the solar-dependent Bellossom.

## Evolution & Biology
Oddish is the first stage of a split evolutionary line. It evolves into **Gloom** starting at **Level 21**. From there, the evolutionary path diverges based on the item used:
*   Gloom evolves into **Vileplume** when exposed to a **Leaf Stone**.
*   Gloom evolves into **Bellossom** when exposed to a **Sun Stone**.

Oddish belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles.
