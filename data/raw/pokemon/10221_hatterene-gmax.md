## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Hatterene (Pokedex #10221) is the Silent Pokémon, a towering and formidable Galar-region variant originating in Generation VIII. While its base form is known for its solitary nature in deep forests, this Gigantamax form stands at a staggering 26 meters tall, emitting psychic power intense enough to induce migraines in anyone nearby. Often referred to as the "Forest Witch," it is notoriously hostile toward those who exhibit strong emotions, using its oversized, tentacle-like braids to pummel its surroundings into silence. This specific form is the result of the Gigantamax phenomenon, a transformation unique to the Galar region that drastically increases its size and grants it access to the signature move **G-Max Smite**, which confuses all opponents on the field.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 57, Attack 90, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 136, Sp. Def 103, Speed 29.
* **Archetype:** Trick Room Special Sweeper. With an incredibly low Speed stat and a massive Special Attack, it is designed to dominate under Trick Room conditions.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison, Ghost, and Steel**. It **resists Psychic** and possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Fighting**. It is completely **immune to Dragon** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Special Attack and its Gigantamax utility, key moves include **Psychic** (high-powered STAB), **Dazzling Gleam** (multi-target STAB that becomes G-Max Smite), **Mystical Fire** (crucial coverage for Steel-type weaknesses), and **Trick Room** (to turn its Speed deficit into a tactical advantage).
* **Abilities:** **Healer** (Chance to cure an ally's status condition), **Anticipation** (Senses the opponent’s dangerous moves upon entry), and **Magic Bounce** (Hidden Ability: Reflects status moves, hazards, and taunts back at the user, making it an exceptional defensive pivot against utility leads).

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Hatterene is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Hatenna**, which evolves into **Hattrem** starting at Level 32. The transformation into the final form, **Hatterene**, occurs at Level 42. While standard Hatterene are common in the Galar wild, only individuals possessing the **Gigantamax Factor** can achieve this massive form when Dynamaxing in Power Spots or Max Raid Dens. Biologically, it is a female-only species belonging to the **Fairy** Egg Group. Despite its delicate, pink-and-blue appearance, its body is essentially a concentrated mass of psychic energy, and in this Gigantamax state, it reaches a weight of 1000.0 kg. It is known for a "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full combat potential.
