## Identity & Lore
Donphan (Pokédex #232) is the **Armor Pokémon**, a ground-dwelling creature originally discovered in the **Johto region (Generation II)**. Residing primarily in rough terrain, this gray, quadrupedal Pokémon is characterized by its rugged, tire-like hide and sharp, hard tusks. Donphan is famous for its rolling ability; it curls its body into a wheel to violently crash into enemies, possessing a **Tackle** strong enough to knock down a house. While not capable of evolution itself, Donphan has significant biological ties to the Paradox Pokémon of Paldea: it shares a striking resemblance to the ancient **Great Tusk** and the futuristic **Iron Treads**.
