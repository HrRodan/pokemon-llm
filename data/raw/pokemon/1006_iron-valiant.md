## Identity & Lore
Iron Valiant (Pokedex #1006) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mysterious and formidable entity first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It bears a striking, robotic resemblance to both Mega Gardevoir and Mega Gallade, appearing as a metallic fusion of these two evolutionary paths. According to lore found within the paranormal publication *Occulture*, Iron Valiant is rumored to be a mad scientist’s attempt to create the ultimate psychic warrior, resulting in a cold, efficient machine that wields a dual-bladed energy glaive. While it lacks a formal Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its very existence as a Future Paradox Pokémon implies it is a high-tech reimagining of the Ralts lineage from the distant future. It is primarily found in the deepest reaches of Area Zero, specifically within the Great Crater of Paldea.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 74, Attack 130, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 120, Sp. Def 60, Speed 116.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper. Its nearly equal, elite-tier offensive stats allow it to threaten opponents from both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, making it incredibly difficult to wall.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Fairy/Fighting type, it is **weak to Poison, Steel, Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Rock and Dark**, possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**, and maintains a complete **Immunity to Dragon**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive offensive versatility, Iron Valiant excels with a kit including **Moonblast** (Special Fairy STAB), **Close Combat** (Physical Fighting STAB), **Knock Off** (Utility and coverage against Psychic/Ghost), and **Shadow Ball** or **Thunderbolt** to pressure diverse defensive cores. It also utilizes **Swords Dance** or **Calm Mind** to set up for a total sweep.
* **Abilities:** Quark Drive (Automatically boosts the Pokémon's most proficient stat by 30%—or 50% if Speed—while active on Electric Terrain or if the Pokémon is holding Booster Energy).

## Evolution & Biology
Iron Valiant is a standalone Paradox Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. It represents a divergent, futuristic timeline for the Ralts, Kirlia, Gardevoir, and Gallade line. Biologically, it is composed of a sleek, white metallic chassis with glowing green and pink energy components. Despite its humanoid shape and resemblance to biological life, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. It is a genderless mechanical being with a high-performance "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential in competitive combat.
