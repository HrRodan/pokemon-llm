## Identity & Lore
Alolan Grimer (Pokedex #10112) is the Sludge Pokémon, a regional variant specifically adapted to the tropical ecosystem of the Alola region (Generation VII). Originally introduced to Alola to solve the region’s burgeoning garbage problem, this variant shifted from its standard purple hue to a vibrant green and yellow coloration with dark black streaks. Unlike its Kantonian counterpart, Alolan Grimer possesses visible "crystals" along its mouth and body, which are actually solidified toxins resulting from its diet of solid waste. These crystals are incredibly sharp and poisonous to the touch. While Alolan Grimer does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Alolan Muk, is a staple of competitive play due to its unique typing. It is commonly found in urban areas and waste disposal sites, thriving on the very pollution that would harm other species.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 80, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 50, Speed 25.
* **Archetype:** Physical Bulky Attacker / Eviolite Tank. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Poison/Dark type, Alolan Grimer has one of the best defensive profiles in the game. It is **weak only to Ground**, while it **resists Poison, Ghost, Grass, and Dark**. Most importantly, it possesses a complete **immunity to Psychic-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its superior Attack stat and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), key moves include **Gunk Shot** (high-power Poison damage), **Knock Off** (essential Dark-type utility for removing items), **Poison Jab** (reliable physical STAB), and **Crunch** (heavy Dark-type physical damage).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Poison Touch:** May poison a target when the Pokémon makes contact, synergizing perfectly with its physical movepool.
    * **Gluttony:** Causes the Pokémon to consume its held berry earlier than usual (at 50% HP), often used in conjunction with defensive berries.
    * **Power of Alchemy (Hidden):** In double battles, this Pokémon copies the ability of a defeated ally, offering high tactical flexibility.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Grimer is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Alolan Muk** starting at **Level 38**. This transformation is marked by the expansion of its chemical crystals and an even more colorful, iridescent sludge pattern. Biologically, Alolan Grimer belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group. It is often seen holding a **Black Sludge** item, which provides passive recovery to Poison-types while damaging any non-Poison-type that might steal it. Its slow speed is compensated for by its significant HP pool and its ability to disrupt opponents using moves like *Toxic*, *Minimize*, or *Knock Off*.
