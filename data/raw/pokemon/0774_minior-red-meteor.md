## Identity & Lore
Minior-Red-Meteor (Pokedex #774) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique Rock/Flying-type life form that originates in the Earth’s ozone layer. This Generation VII (Alola) native spends its life consuming dust particles in the atmosphere; as it feeds, it develops a dense, heavy outer shell. Eventually, the weight of this rocky debris causes it to plummet toward the surface, landing in a fiery descent. While the specimen described here is in its Red Meteor form, this shell serves as protective armor for a vibrantly colored "Core" hidden within. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its entire biology is defined by its transformative "Shields Down" mechanic, which allows it to transition from a defensive hunk of space rock into a high-speed, glass-cannon core.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 100, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Setup Sweeper. In its Meteor form, Minior functions as a tanky setup platform, using its high defenses to survive hits while preparing to sweep.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Electric, Ice, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, and Flying**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground** moves thanks to its Flying typing. 
* **Move Selection:** Minior thrives on high-risk, high-reward strategies. Key moves include **Shell Smash** to double its offensive presence, **Acrobatics** (which becomes devastatingly powerful if it consumes its held item, like a White Herb), **Stone Edge** for STAB-boosted physical damage, and **Earthquake** for vital coverage against Steel and Rock types.
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon remains in its Meteor Form while above 50% HP, granting it high defenses and immunity to status conditions like Burn, Paralysis, or Sleep. Once its HP drops below 50%, the shell shatters, drastically increasing its Attack and Speed while lowering its defenses).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species; however, it is biologically multifaceted. Its "Red" designation refers to the color of the core beneath its brown, stony exterior. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and is genderless, making it only compatible with Ditto for breeding purposes. Despite its lack of an evolutionary line, its transformation triggers a massive stat redistribution: in its Core form, its Base Defense and Special Defense drop to 60, while its Base Attack, Special Attack, and Speed skyrocket to 100, 100, and 120 respectively. This makes Minior one of the most unpredictable threats in the Alolan Pokedex, capable of flipping from a wall to a sweeper in a single turn.
