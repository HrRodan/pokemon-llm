## Identity & Lore
Wyrdeer (Pokedex #899) is the Big Horn Pokémon, a majestic and powerful evolution of Stantler introduced in the Hisui region during Generation VIII (*Pokémon Legends: Arceus*). This Normal and Psychic-type Pokémon is characterized by its thick, gray coat and massive antlers adorned with black orbs that emit an uncanny light when it unleashes psychic energy. Wyrdeer is known for erecting invisible barriers to protect its herd, and its beard fur is highly prized by the people of Hisui for its incredible heat retention, making it an essential material for winter clothing. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it stands as a unique regional evolution that was thought to be extinct in modern times until its rediscovery in the ancient past of the Sinnoh region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 103, Attack 105, Defense 72, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 75, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Bulky Attacker. With balanced offensive stats and high HP but low Speed, Wyrdeer excels as a mid-tier tank or a devastating sweeper within a **Trick Room** team.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug and Dark**. It **resists Psychic** and possesses a total **immunity to Ghost**, which is a rare and valuable trait for a Psychic-type, allowing it to safely switch into Shadow Balls.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its equal Attack and Special Attack stats, Wyrdeer utilizes a versatile movepool. Key moves include its signature **Psyshield Bash** (which raises its Defense), **High Horsepower** for Ground-type coverage, **Psychic** for powerful Special STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), and **Megahorn** to surprise opposing Dark and Psychic types.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Intimidate:** Automatically lowers the Attack of opposing Pokémon upon entering battle, significantly bolstering Wyrdeer's physical bulk.
    * **Frisk:** Allows the trainer to see the opponent's held item, providing vital tactical information.
    * **Sap Sipper (Hidden Ability):** Provides an immunity to Grass-type moves and boosts Wyrdeer's Attack stat when hit by one, making it an excellent counter to "Spore" or "Leaf Storm" users.

## Evolution & Biology
Wyrdeer is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Stantler** after the Pokémon masters the move **Psyshield Bash**, specifically by using it in the **Agile Style** 20 times (in the Hisui region). It belongs to the **Ground** egg group. Biologically, Wyrdeer has adapted to the harsh, snowy environments of the Cobalt Coastlands and Alabaster Icelands, using its psychic powers to sense the safest paths through the wilderness. Its sturdy build and high HP make it a reliable mount for traversing rugged terrain.
