## Identity & Lore
Electabuzz (Pokedex #125) is the Electric Pokémon originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This bipedal, yellow humanoid creature is covered in black stripes, reminiscent of a tiger's pattern or caution tape, signifying its volatile nature. Electabuzz typically inhabits grasslands but is most frequently found near **power plants**, where it feeds on electricity. Its body constantly leaks electricity, often causing it to glow blue in the dark. It is notorious for wandering into cities and causing major blackouts to consume energy. While it has no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the middle stage of a powerful cross-generational evolutionary line.

## Evolution & Biology
Electabuzz is the second stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the baby Pokémon **Elekid** starting at **Level 30**. To reach its final form, **Electivire**, Electabuzz must be **traded** to another trainer while holding the **Electirizer** item. It belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group, reflecting its anthropomorphic physiology.
