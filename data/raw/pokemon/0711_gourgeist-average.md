## Identity & Lore
Gourgeist (Pokedex #711) is the Pumpkin Pokémon, a haunting dual-type Ghost and Grass-type creature first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). This specific form is the Average Size Gourgeist, distinguished by its balanced proportions compared to its Small, Large, and Super Size counterparts. Characterized by its Jack-o'-lantern-like body and hair-like appendages that function as arms, Gourgeist is known for its eerie behavior during the night of the new moon. According to legend, they wander city streets singing in haunting, melodic voices; those who hear their song are believed to be cursed. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique mechanic involves its physical size directly influencing its base stats—specifically its HP and Attack—making it a fascinating subject for biological study.

## Evolution & Biology
Gourgeist is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pumpkaboo** only when **exchanged between trainers via trade**. This biological shift causes the pumpkin body to mature and the spectral "hair" to lengthen into powerful limbs. Belonging to the **Amorphous (Indeterminate) Egg Group**, Gourgeist has a medium growth rate. Its biology is deeply tied to its physical dimensions; while this Average form is a versatile generalist, the Super Size variants are known for significantly higher bulk at the cost of speed. In the wild, they are often found in eerie, shadowy environments, using their "arms" to ensnare prey while singing their mournful, cursed melodies.
