## Identity & Lore
Aron (Pokedex #304) is the Iron Armor Pokémon, a dual-type Steel/Rock creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in mountainous areas, this quadrupedal, gray Pokémon possesses a body of steel generated by its diet. To maintain its armored shell, Aron feeds on iron ore dug from mountains, though it is often considered a pest because it occasionally descends from its habitat to devour man-made iron structures like bridges and rails. While small, it possesses immense potential, eventually evolving into the massive Aggron, which is capable of undergoing Mega Evolution in later generations.
