## Identity & Lore
Machoke (Pokédex #067) is the Superpower Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This muscular, gray humanoid typically inhabits mountainous regions where it hones its immense physical strength. Its body is so powerful that it is biologically required to wear a specialized power-save belt to regulate its motions; without this limiter, its unchecked strength would be uncontrollable and dangerous to its surroundings. Known for its tireless work ethic, Machoke is often depicted assisting humans with heavy labor due to its boundless stamina. While Machoke itself does not possess form variants, its final evolution, Machamp, is capable of Gigantamaxing.
