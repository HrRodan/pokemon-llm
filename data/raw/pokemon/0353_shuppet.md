## Identity & Lore
Shuppet (Pokedex #353) is the **Puppet Pokémon** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. This nocturnal spirit is drawn to the negativity in human hearts, specifically feeding on emotions like jealousy, vindictiveness, and malice. Residing primarily in **urban** environments, Shuppet is known to swarm and hover beneath the eaves of houses inhabited by vengeful people to consume their grudges. While it resembles a simple cloth puppet brought to life, it possesses significant latent power that reaches its peak upon evolution. While Shuppet does not change form, its evolution, Banette, is capable of **Mega Evolution**.
