## Identity & Lore
Arceus (Pokedex #493) is the **Alpha Pokémon**, a Mythical entity revered as the "Original One" in Sinnoh mythology (Generation IV). It is a white, quadrupedal being described in legends as the creator of the entire Pokémon universe, having shaped reality with its "1,000 arms." Lore suggests it emerged from an egg in a place where there was nothing, subsequently creating the Creation Trio (Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina) and the Lake Guardians. While normally a Normal-type, Arceus possesses the unique ability to change its elemental alignment and form when holding specific elemental **Plates** or Z-Crystals. In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it is revealed to reside in the Hall of Origin.
