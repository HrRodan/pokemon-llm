## Identity & Lore
Mega Meganium (Pokedex #10282) is the majestic Mega Evolved form of the Herb Pokémon, a creature whose lineage traces back to the Johto region of Generation II. Standing at 2.4 meters, this quadrupedal dinosaur-like entity is distinguished by the vibrant, blossoming petals encircling its neck. According to legend, the aroma wafting from these petals contains unique substances capable of soothing even the most aggressive temperaments, effectively ending conflicts without violence. While Meganium is primarily found in lush grasslands, its Mega Evolution unleashes a latent mystical energy, granting it the **Fairy type** alongside its native Grass typing. Although it lacks a Gigantamax or Paradox form, this Mega Evolution represents the absolute peak of its evolutionary potential, transforming it from a defensive stalwart into a radiant powerhouse of nature.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 92, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 143, Sp. Def 115, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** Mega Meganium is **weak to Flying, Fire, Ice, Bug, and Steel**. Notably, its dual Grass/Fairy typing results in a **Double Weakness (4x) to Poison**. Conversely, it **resists Fighting, Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, and Dark**, and possesses a total **Immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its elite Special Attack stat, Mega Meganium thrives with a moveset consisting of **Moonblast** for massive Fairy-type STAB damage, **Giga Drain** for simultaneous offense and recovery, **Earth Power** to provide vital coverage against Steel and Poison-type counters, and **Synthesis** to maintain its longevity on the field.
* **Abilities:** While its Mega-specific ability is often tied to botanical mastery, it traditionally draws from **Overgrow**, which strengthens Grass-type moves when its health is low, or **Leaf Guard**, which protects the Pokémon from status conditions like paralysis or burn during intense sunlight.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Meganium is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line. The journey begins with **Chikorita**, which evolves into **Bayleef** starting at Level 16. The transition to its final form, **Meganium**, occurs at Level 32. The "Mega" state is a temporary, high-energy transformation triggered in battle when Meganium holds a Mega Stone. Biologically, it is a member of both the **Monster and Plant Egg Groups**, requiring a moderate hatch cycle (20 cycles) for breeders. Its growth rate is medium-slow, reflecting the patience required to cultivate the immense floral power stored within its body.
