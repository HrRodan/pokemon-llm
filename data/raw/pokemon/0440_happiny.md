## Identity & Lore
Happiny (Pokedex #440) is the Playhouse Pokémon, a pure Normal-type introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Visually defined by its pink coloration and humanoid shape, this Baby Pokémon is famous for its mimicry of its evolution, Chansey. Lacking the ability to lay eggs, it seeks out round white stones to carry in its pouch-like belly to practice motherhood. It is particularly fond of round white objects and protects its carried stone with great care. While small, Happiny possesses immense strength for its size.
