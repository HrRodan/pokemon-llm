## Identity & Lore
Tirtouga (Pokedex #564) is the Prototurtle Pokémon, a prehistoric species first introduced in the Unova region (Generation V). Originally inhabiting the oceans roughly 100 million years ago, this ancient Pokémon is brought back to the modern era by reviving a **Cover Fossil**. Tirtouga is characterized by its deep blue, leathery skin and a dark, stony shell that provides immense protection. Despite its bulky appearance, it is a proficient diver, capable of reaching depths of over half a mile in search of prey. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Carracosta, is known for its incredible physical power and ability to crush steel frames with a single blow.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 54, Attack 78, Defense 103, Sp. Atk 53, Sp. Def 45, Speed 22.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Shell Smash Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass**. It is also weak to **Electric, Fighting, and Ground** types. Conversely, it highly **resists Fire (0.25x)** and provides resistances against **Normal, Flying, Poison, and Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Attack stat and defensive utility, Tirtouga excels with moves such as **Liquidation** (High-damage STAB), **Stone Edge** (Critical-hit prone STAB), **Aqua Jet** (Essential priority to bypass its low Speed), and **Shell Smash** (A high-risk, high-reward setup move that doubles its offensive presence).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Solid Rock:** Reduces the damage taken from super-effective moves by 25%, significantly increasing its survivability against its many weaknesses.
    * **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full health, acting as a natural Focus Sash.
    * **Swift Swim (Hidden):** Doubles Tirtouga's Speed stat during rain, allowing it to function as a niche offensive threat in weather-based teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Tirtouga is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Carracosta** starting at **Level 37**. As a member of the **Water 1** and **Water 3** Egg Groups, Tirtouga shares biological traits with both aquatic vertebrates and hard-shelled invertebrates. Its biology is a testament to its endurance; it possesses a heavy frame that, while slowing it down on land, allows it to withstand the crushing pressures of the deep sea. It has a hatch counter of 30, reflecting its status as a rare Fossil Pokémon that requires significant effort to incubate and train.
