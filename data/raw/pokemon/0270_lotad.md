## Identity & Lore
Lotad (Pokedex #270) is the Water Weed Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Grass creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily at the **water's edge**, this small amphibious Pokémon is distinguished by the large, lily-pad-like leaf on its head. Lotad is highly dependent on hydration; it instinctively searches for clean water, and if it fails to drink for an extended period, the leaf on its head will wilt and droop. While clumsy and slow on land, Lotad floats effortlessly on the water's surface, often serving as a ferry for smaller Pokémon that cannot swim.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 30, Defense 30, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 50, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Rain Dish Tank / Little Cup Special Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a unique Water/Grass type, Lotad possesses a defensive advantage. It is **weak to Flying, Poison, and Bug** types. However, it defensively **resists Water (4x), Ground, and Steel**. Notably, its typing neutralizes the standard Water weakness to Electric and the standard Grass weakness to Fire.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its slightly higher Special Attack and bulk, Lotad functions best with moves like **Giga Drain** (for sustain), **Scald** (for damage and burn chance), **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Flying/Grass types), and **Rain Dance** to trigger its abilities.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, making Lotad surprisingly fast in specific weather conditions.
    *   **Rain Dish:** The Pokémon gradually recovers HP when the weather is rainy.
    *   **Own Tempo (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused and blocks the effect of Intimidate.

## Evolution & Biology
Lotad is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Lombre** starting at **Level 14**. Lombre can subsequently evolve into the final form, **Ludicolo**, when exposed to a **Water Stone**. In the wild, Lotad may occasionally carry a **Mental Herb**. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Grass (Plant)** Egg Groups, making it compatible with a wide variety of parents for breeding.
