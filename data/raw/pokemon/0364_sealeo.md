## Identity & Lore
Sealeo (Pokedex #364) is the Ball Roll Pokémon, a dual-type Ice/Water creature first documented in the **Hoenn** region (Generation III). Distinguished by its vibrant blue hide and cream-colored jaw, this marine mammal inhabits icy seas and cold oceanic environments. Sealeo is renowned for its playful yet compulsive behavior; it instinctively balances new objects on the tip of its nose to inspect their scent and texture. In a display of social interaction, it is frequently observed balancing and rolling its pre-evolution, Spheal, on its nose as a form of play. While generally docile, its stout body allows it to crush ice flows and navigate freezing waters with ease.
