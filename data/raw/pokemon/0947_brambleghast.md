## Identity & Lore
Brambleghast (Pokedex #947) is the Tumbleweed Pokémon, a spectral entity introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This brown, spherical Pokémon is a mass of tangled, thorny branches possessed by a soul that has become trapped within a dried-up plant. According to its lore, it rolls across the vast desert and wasteland regions of Paldea, opening its branches to envelop unsuspecting prey. Once caught, Brambleghast absorbs the victim’s life energy until it is entirely drained, eventually discarding the empty husk. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique biology as a sentient, wind-driven ghost makes it a distinct biological anomaly in the Paldean ecosystem.

## Evolution & Biology
Brambleghast is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bramblin** through a unique environmental trigger: it must be leveled up after the trainer has walked with it for **1,000 steps using the "Let's Go" feature** in the Paldea region. Weighing only 6.0kg, its light frame allows it to be carried effortlessly by the wind, which it utilizes both for travel and to power up its combat capabilities via its Wind Rider ability. It belongs to the **Grass** (Plant) egg group and is known for its predatory behavior of "expelling and discarding" prey after siphoning their energy.
