## Identity & Lore
Scream Tail (Pokedex #985) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mysterious and primitive relative of the contemporary Jigglypuff discovered within the Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero). Introduced in Generation IX (Paldea), this Fairy/Psychic-type is classified as an "Ancient Pokémon," rumored to be a version of Jigglypuff from a billion years ago. It is characterized by its long, whip-like ponytail, fierce yellow eyes, and protruding fangs, which contrast sharply with the docile nature of its modern descendant. According to the Scarlet Book, it is a feral creature that possesses a "scream" so loud and unsettling that it gives the species its name. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it belongs to the exclusive group of Paradox Pokémon, which are considered biological anomalies with power levels comparable to minor legendary entities.

## Evolution & Biology
Scream Tail is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. It shares a striking biological resemblance to Jigglypuff, but genetic analysis suggests it is a separate entity displaced from a distant past. Because it is a Paradox Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot breed in captivity. It has a **Slow** growth rate and a high base experience yield, reflecting the difficulty of taming such a primal creature. Its biology is optimized for survival in a prehistoric environment, trading the "Balloon" Pokémon's soft nature for high-speed mobility and immense special resilience.
