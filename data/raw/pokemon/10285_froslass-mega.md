## Identity & Lore
Mega Froslass (Pokedex #10285) is the Snow Land Pokémon, a specialized Mega Evolution of the Ice/Ghost-type Pokémon originally discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). It is said to be born from the soul of a woman who was lost on a snowy mountain, and its design heavily reflects the *Yuki-onna* of Japanese folklore. Despite its elegant, kimono-like appearance, its biological structure is unsettling; its body is entirely hollow, a trait it hides beneath its frozen exterior. Mega Froslass can exhale breath reaching temperatures of -60 degrees Fahrenheit, instantly flash-freezing any prey or foe it encounters to display as frozen decorations in its icy den. While its counterpart, Glalie, also possesses a Mega Evolution, Mega Froslass represents a more refined, ghostly mastery over the frozen elements.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 80, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 140, Sp. Def 100, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Rock, Steel, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Ice, Poison, and Bug**, and possesses total **immunity to Normal and Fighting-type attacks**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Special Attack and high Speed, key moves include **Shadow Ball** for consistent Ghost-type STAB, **Ice Beam** for reliable freezing damage, **Blizzard** for maximum power in Hail, and **Destiny Bond**, a tactical utility move that utilizes its Ghost typing to take down opponents with it if it faints.
* **Abilities:** While the Mega form's specific ability can vary in different manifestations, it typically retains or enhances traits like **Cursed Body** (which has a 30% chance to disable a move that hits it) or **Snow Cloak** (increasing evasion during a hailstorm), though a Mega form of this caliber would likely utilize a more offensive ability like **Magic Bounce** or **Snow Warning** to dictate the flow of battle.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Froslass is the final stage of a complex, three-stage branched evolutionary line. It begins as **Snorunt**, which evolves into Froslass only if it is **female and exposed to a Dawn Stone**. This is a distinct branch from Snorunt's other evolution, Glalie, which occurs at Level 42 regardless of gender. The transition to its Mega form is triggered through the use of a **Froslassite Mega Stone** during combat. Biologically, it belongs to the **Fairy and Mineral** egg groups. Its white, frozen "clothing" is actually a shell of ice that protects its spirit-based, hollow core, and it is known for its graceful yet predatory behavior in cold, mountainous habitats.
