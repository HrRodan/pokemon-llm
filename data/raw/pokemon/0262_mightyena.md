## Identity & Lore
Mightyena (Pokedex #262) is the Bite Pokémon, a gray, quadrupedal canine native to the grasslands of the Hoenn region (Generation III). Noted for its aggressive nature and pack mentality, this Pokémon gives obvious signals when preparing to attack; it growls deeply and flattens its body before biting savagely with sharply pointed fangs. While wild Mightyena act in coordination to take down prey, they are known to be highly obedient to skilled trainers, a trait that has made them a common partner for grunt members of Team Magma and Team Aqua.
