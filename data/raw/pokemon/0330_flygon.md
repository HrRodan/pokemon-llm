## Identity & Lore
Flygon (Pokédex #330) is the Mystic Pokémon, a dual-type Ground/Dragon creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Often revered as "The Elemental Spirit of the Desert," Flygon is famous for the melodious sound generated by the flapping of its wings, which resembles a woman singing. This auditory illusion often lures prey or travelers into the violent sandstorms that Flygon generates to conceal itself. Biologically, it features large, rhombus-shaped wings and red covers over its eyes, which protect its vision from whipping sand. Despite its insectoid appearance and Bug-type Egg Group classification, it retains the Dragon typing. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it remains a fan-favorite for its balanced design and lore connection to rough, arid terrains.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 100, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 80, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Sweeper / Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** It possesses a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice** moves, as well as standard weaknesses to **Dragon** and **Fairy**. However, it resists **Poison, Rock, and Fire**, and boasts a valuable immunity to **Electric** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Base 100 Attack and Speed, its optimal moveset includes **Earthquake** (powerful STAB), **Dragon Claw** (consistent STAB), **Dragon Dance** (to boost Attack and Speed), and **U-turn** (for tactical pivoting).
*   **Abilities:** **Levitate** (Makes the Pokémon immune to Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes). This grants Flygon a unique tactical advantage, as it is a Ground-type that is immune to Ground-type attacks, effectively removing a weakness often shared by its teammates.

## Evolution & Biology
Flygon is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins life as the ant-pit Pokémon Trapinch, evolving into Vibrava when leveled up to **Level 35**. Vibrava subsequently evolves into Flygon starting at **Level 45**. Unlike its pre-evolution Trapinch, which is a pure Ground-type grounded trapper, Flygon gains the Dragon type and the ability to fly. It belongs to the **Bug** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, reflecting its insect-like biology despite its draconic typing.
