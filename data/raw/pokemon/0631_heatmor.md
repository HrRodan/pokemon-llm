## Identity & Lore
Heatmor (#631) is the Anteater Pokémon, a bipedal, flame-colored creature first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Its physiology is highly specialized for hunting its natural prey, the Steel-type Durant. Heatmor draws air through a hole in its tail to fuel an internal combustion chamber, allowing it to exhale tongues of fire like a blowtorch to melt through Durant's metal carapaces. While it does not currently possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, its unique biology is defined by the corrugated, pipe-like ridges on its body that resemble heat-resistant tubing. In its natural habitat, it is often found in mountainous or volcanic areas where it uses its superheated breath to scour the earth for food.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 97, Defense 66, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 66, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker. Its offensive stats are well-balanced, allowing it to threaten opponents from both the physical and special sides of the spectrum, though it suffers from lackluster defensive bulk and low speed.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fire-type, it is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Water**. It **resists Bug, Steel, Grass, Ice, Fire, and Fairy** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Heatmor leverages its high Special Attack and diverse physical movepool. Key moves include **Fire Lash** (a signature physical move that lowers the target's Defense), **Flamethrower** (consistent Special STAB), **Giga Drain** (critical coverage to hit Water, Ground, and Rock types while recovering HP), and **Sucker Punch** (essential priority to compensate for its low Speed).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Flash Fire:** Grants immunity to Fire-type moves and powers up its own Fire attacks by 50% when hit by one.
    * **Gluttony:** Causes the Pokémon to consume its held Berry earlier than usual (at 50% HP).
    * **White Smoke (Hidden):** Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats, making it immune to Intimidate and other debuffs.

## Evolution & Biology
Heatmor is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It exists in a permanent biological rivalry with Durant, a relationship that defines much of its behavior and movepool (such as access to moves like *Dig* and *Superpower* to counter its rival's Steel/Bug typing). It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders. Often found holding a **Flame Orb**, it can utilize its internal heat to manipulate thermal energy, though it must constantly breathe through its tail to maintain its internal temperature.
