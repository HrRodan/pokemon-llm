## Identity & Lore
Totem Araquanid (Pokedex #10153) is the massive and intimidating variant of the Water Bubble Pokémon, uniquely identified as a Totem Pokémon encountered during the Alolan Island Challenge in Generation VII (Alola). Standing at a staggering 3.1 meters—over double the height of a standard Araquanid—this specimen serves as the guardian of Brooklet Hill. Its primary feature is the translucent bubble of water surrounding its head, which it uses both to breathe on land and as a lethal weapon. Lore dictates that it delivers devastating headbutts with this bubble; unfortunately, smaller Pokémon that get sucked into the sphere face a grim fate, drowning within the pressurized water. Its green, armor-like exoskeleton provides natural defense against the humid environments of the Alolan jungles. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Totem Pokémon grants it a specialized aura that boosts its defensive capabilities in battle.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 70, Defense 92, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 132, Speed 42.
* **Archetype:** Special Wall / Bulky Physical Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Electric, Flying, and Rock**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Ice**. Additionally, its ability provides a hidden resistance to Fire-type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its modest base Attack, its unique ability makes its physical Water-type moves hit with legendary force. Key moves include **Liquidation** (its primary STAB move with massive damage potential), **Leech Life** (for Bug-type damage and vital HP recovery), **Lunge** (to lower the opponent's Attack and increase survivability), and **Mirror Coat** (to capitalize on its massive Special Defense by reflecting special damage back at the foe).
* **Abilities:** **Water Bubble** is its signature ability and the core of its viability; it doubles the power of Water-type moves, provides total immunity to Burns, and halves incoming Fire-type damage. **Water-Absorb** (Hidden Ability) allows it to heal when hit by Water-type attacks, making it a niche switch-in for rain teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Araquanid represents the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Dewpider** once it reaches **Level 22**. While this specific Totem variant is found at a much larger size than usual, its biological roots remain tied to the **Water 1** and **Bug** Egg Groups. In the wild, it is known to be a protective parent, though its methods are harsh; it often protects its young within its bubble, ironically the same place where it dispatches its prey. Its slow Speed (42) makes it a premier candidate for **Trick Room** teams, where it can utilize its high Special Defense and boosted Attack power to sweep through opponents before they can react. It is often found holding **Mystic Water** to further augment its Water-type dominance.
