## Identity & Lore
Koraidon in its Sprinting Build (Pokedex #10265) is a primeval Paradox Pokémon belonging to the "Winged King" lineage. First discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX, this prehistoric ancestor of Cyclizar is characterized by its vibrant red coloration and powerful, lizard-like physique. According to ancient expedition journals, it was known to split the earth with its bare fists and was feared as the "Winged King" of a bygone era. While this specific "Sprinting Build" represents its terrestrial transit state, Koraidon possesses an "Apex Build" for true combat and a "Limited Build" when weakened. Though it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is fundamentally a Paradox Pokémon, an enigmatic category of creatures brought through time via the Area Zero phenomenon in *Pokémon Scarlet*.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 135, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 100, Speed 135.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Wallbreaker. With elite Speed and massive Attack, Koraidon is designed to outpace most of the meta and deliver devastating physical blows.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a Fighting/Dragon-type, making it **weak to Flying, Psychic, Ice, and Dragon**, with a dangerous **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. It compensates with resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Bug, Rock, and Dark.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its monstrous Attack stat and signature mechanics, key moves include **Collision Course** (its signature Fighting move that deals increased damage on super-effective hits), **Flare Blitz** (which gains a massive boost from its ability), **Close Combat**, and **Outrage** for raw Dragon-type power.
* **Abilities:** **Orichalcum Pulse** is its defining trait. Upon entering battle, Koraidon summons harsh sunlight and receives a significant Attack boost while the sun is active, making it a premier "Sun Setter" and self-sufficient sweeper.

## Evolution & Biology
Koraidon is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is considered a Paradox relative of the modern-day Cyclizar. Biologically, it is built for extreme endurance and high-speed traversal, utilizing its powerful hind legs to sprint across the Paldean terrain. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Despite its intimidating "Winged King" persona, it shows high intelligence and can form deep bonds with humans, though its low base happiness and slow growth rate reflect the difficulty of taming such a primal force of nature.
