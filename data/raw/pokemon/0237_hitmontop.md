## Identity & Lore
Hitmontop (Pokedex #237) is the **Handstand Pokémon**, first introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Distinguished by the sharp horn atop its head, this Fighting-type Pokémon is famous for its unique fighting style, Capoeira, which involves spinning on its head to deliver high-speed, centrifugal kicks. Its bio-mechanics allow it to rotate at high velocities, delivering blows that are both elegant and devastating. The "flavor" of its movement is often described as dance-like, which can lull opponents into a false sense of security before they are drilled by a powerful kick. It is predominantly found in urban habitats. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is one of the three final forms of the Tyrogue family, representing perfect balance.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Intimidate:** Lowers the opposing Pokémon's Attack stat upon entering battle, making Hitmontop an excellent physical tank.
    *   **Technician:** Increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%, significantly boosting moves like Mach Punch and Triple Kick.
    *   **Steadfast (Hidden):** Boosts the Pokémon's Speed stat by one stage every time it flinches.

## Evolution & Biology
Hitmontop is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line with a split evolution path. It evolves from **Tyrogue** starting at **Level 20**, specifically when Tyrogue's **Attack stat equals its Defense stat**. If the stats are not balanced, Tyrogue will instead evolve into Hitmonlee (Attack > Defense) or Hitmonchan (Defense > Attack). It belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group, and as a male-only species, it requires a Ditto for breeding.
