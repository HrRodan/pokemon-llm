## Identity & Lore
Elgyem (Pokedex #605) is the Cerebral Pokémon, a mysterious extraterrestrial-themed entity first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a small, blue, humanoid figure with a disproportionately large, oblong head marked by light-emitting patterns, Elgyem is said to have appeared in a desert 50 years ago following a rumored UFO crash. This Pokémon possesses terrifying mental capabilities, using its intense psychic powers to squeeze an opponent's brain, inducing unendurable headaches and potentially rewriting memories. Its name is a phonetic play on "LGM," an acronym for "Little Green Men," reflecting its alien origins and habitat near remote sites like Celestial Tower or the Desert Resort. While Elgyem currently possesses no known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts, its enigmatic biology continues to be a focal point of extraterrestrial research in the Pokémon world.

## Evolution & Biology
Elgyem is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the more powerful Beheeyem starting at **Level 42**. Biologically, it is a small creature standing 0.5 meters tall and weighing 9.0 kilograms, primarily characterized by the three colored dots on its hands (red, green, and yellow) which it uses to communicate via light signals. It belongs to the **Human-Like** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, indicating it requires a moderate amount of travel to hatch from an egg. Despite its diminutive size, its brain is extraordinarily developed, allowing it to perform complex telekinetic feats that defy standard terrestrial biology.
