## Identity & Lore
Exploud (Pokedex #295) is the Loud Noise Pokémon, a distinctively designed creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This large, blue, upright Pokémon is characterized by the multiple ports and tubes protruding from its body, which act as biological amplifiers. Its biology is centered around acoustic destruction; Exploud triggers earthquakes and tremors simply by bellowing. When it violently inhales through the ports on its body, it signals the preparation of a sound blast capable of being heard from over six miles away. Typically found inhabiting caves where its voice can echo, Exploud possesses a volatile nature matching its destructive vocal cords.
