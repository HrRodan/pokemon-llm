## Identity & Lore
Rowlet (Pokedex #722) is the Grass Quill Pokémon and serves as the Grass-type starter for trainers beginning their journey in the Alola region of Generation VII. This avian Pokémon is characterized by its spherical body and a plumage of brown feathers, featuring a distinctive pair of leaves on its chest that resemble a bowtie. A wary and nocturnal hunter, Rowlet utilizes photosynthesis during the daylight hours to store energy, becoming highly active and silent under the cover of night. It is famous for its ability to rotate its head nearly 180 degrees to look directly behind itself, allowing it to track prey or take instructions from its trainer with ease. While Rowlet does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolutionary stage, Decidueye, is notable for having a distinct Hisuian Form (Grass/Fighting) discovered in the ancient Hisui region, marking this evolutionary line as one of the few with regional divergence.

## Evolution & Biology
Rowlet is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dartrix** starting at Level 17, which subsequently evolves into **Decidueye** starting at Level 34. In most regions, Decidueye takes on a Grass/Ghost typing; however, if evolved in the Hisui region, it becomes the Grass/Fighting-type Hisuian Decidueye. Rowlet belongs to the **Flying** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders. Biologically, Rowlet is known for launching razor-sharp feathers—which are actually part of its wings—to attack from a distance, reflecting its "Grass Quill" classification.
