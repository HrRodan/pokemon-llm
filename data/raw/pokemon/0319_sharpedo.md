## Identity & Lore
Sharpedo (Pokedex #319) is the Brutal Pokémon, a feared aquatic predator first discovered in the **Generation III (Hoenn)** region. Known colloquially as "the bully of the sea," this dual-type Water/Dark Pokémon is characterized by its savage nature and incredible destructive power; a single specimen is capable of thoroughly tearing apart a supertanker using its cruel fangs. Biologically, if these fangs snap off during an attack, they grow back immediately, ensuring Sharpedo is always combat-ready. While it typically patrols the sea, Sharpedo possesses the latent potential to utilize the Sharpedonite to achieve **Mega Evolution**, becoming Mega Sharpedo, which further enhances its aggressive capabilities.
