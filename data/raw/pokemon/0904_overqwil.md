## Identity & Lore
Overqwil (Pokedex #904) is the Pin Cluster Pokémon, a menacing Dark and Poison-type regional evolution first discovered in the ancient Hisui region (Generation VIII). Characterized by its massive size and lancelike spikes, Overqwil is a far more aggressive relative of the standard Qwilfish found in other regions. Its body is covered in black, hardened skin and numerous long, venomous needles that it uses to dominate its aquatic territory, earning it the terrifying nickname "sea fiend." Lore states that this Pokémon slurps up poison to nourish itself, fueled by a savage temperament that makes it a hazard to anything entering its waters. While it currently lacks Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its status as a regional evolution of Hisuian Qwilfish makes it a unique relic of Pokémon history.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 85, Attack 115, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 65, Speed 85.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Rain Sweeper. With its high Attack and respectable Defense, Overqwil can function as a bulky attacker or a specialized speedster under specific weather conditions.
* **Type Matchups:** It is uniquely **weak only to Ground**. It provides excellent defensive utility by being **immune to Psychic** and offering **resistances to Grass, Poison, Ghost, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high physical Attack and signature capabilities, key moves include **Barb Barrage** (its signature move which can poison the target and deal double damage if they are already afflicted), **Gunk Shot** for massive Poison-type STAB, **Crunch** for reliable Dark-type damage, and **Swords Dance** to boost its sweeping potential.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Poison Point:** May poison attackers that make direct contact, punishing physical hitters.
    * **Swift Swim:** Doubles its Speed stat in the rain, transforming it into a dangerous offensive threat on Rain teams.
    * **Intimidate (Hidden):** Lowers the opponent's Attack upon entering battle, significantly boosting its physical bulk and utility as a pivot.

## Evolution & Biology
Overqwil is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hisuian Qwilfish** after the Pokémon has mastered the art of combat, specifically by using the move **Barb Barrage** in the **Strong Style** twenty times (as documented in the Hisui region). This evolution represents a drastic increase in size and needle length compared to its predecessor. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group. Its metabolism is uniquely tied to toxins, and its spikes are not merely for defense but act as biological conduits for the concentrated poisons it consumes and produces.
