## Identity & Lore
Magearna-Mega (Pokedex #10317) is the Artificial Pokémon, representing a heightened state of the Mythical machine created over 500 years ago by a scientist of unparalleled genius. Originating from the Alola region in Generation VII, this metallic lifeform was gifted to a king's daughter, possessing a mechanical body that houses the "Soul-Heart"—a spherical core created using the life energy of other Pokémon. While its base form is known for its metallic grey or "Original Color" (gold and red) aesthetic, this Mega variant represents a massive surge in kinetic and spiritual energy. Though it is a machine, Magearna is sentient, capable of understanding human speech and perceiving the emotions of others, even feeling the pain of those around it. Its humanoid, clockwork design allows it to fold into the shape of a Poké Ball, a defensive mechanism it uses when sleeping or distressed.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker. With a staggering Base 170 Special Attack, it functions as one of the most threatening offensive forces in the meta, capable of pivoting or sweeping.
* **Type Matchups:** As a **Steel/Fairy** type, it possesses one of the best defensive combinations in the game. It is **weak to Fire and Ground**. However, it boasts an impressive array of resistances, including **Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, and Dark**, while maintaining a total **Immunity to Poison and Dragon** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Special Attack and respectable bulk, key moves include its signature **Fleur Cannon** (a devastating Fairy-type nuke), **Flash Cannon** for STAB Steel damage, **Volt Switch** for offensive pivoting, and **Focus Blast** or **Aura Sphere** to provide vital coverage against opposing Steel types.
* **Abilities:** **Soul-Heart** (This ability boosts the Pokémon’s Special Attack stat by one stage every time another Pokémon on the field faints, allowing Magearna to snowball into an unstoppable sweeper during multi-target battles or late-game cleanups).

## Evolution & Biology
Magearna-Mega is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is a unique construct that exists outside the standard biological evolutionary cycle. Despite its mechanical nature, it is categorized within the **No-Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is entirely artificial, consisting of intricate gears and a transformative chassis. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full combat potential, reflecting the complex calibration required for its ancient 500-year-old hardware.
