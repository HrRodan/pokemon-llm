## Identity & Lore
Hoopa (Pokedex #720) is the Mischief Pokémon, a purple, ethereal Mythical Pokémon that first appeared in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Known as a notorious troublemaker, Hoopa possesses golden rings that act as portals, allowing it to warp space and seize anything it desires, often transporting items or even legendary Pokémon to faraway places. While it is typically seen in its "Hoopa Confined" state, lore dictates that its true power is sealed away; when exposed to the **Prison Bottle**, it transforms into its colossal **Hoopa Unbound** form, shifting from a Psychic/Ghost-type to a massive Psychic/Dark-type with six arms. Hoopa is also the central figure of the movie *Hoopa and the Clash of Ages*, where it summoned various Legendary Pokémon across different timelines.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 110, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 150, Sp. Def 130, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker / Nuker. With a massive Base 150 Special Attack, Hoopa is designed to punch holes in defensive teams, though its low physical defense makes it a "Glass Cannon" against physical attackers.
* **Type Matchups:** In its Confined form, it is **Double Weak (4x) to Ghost and Dark** types. It is also **weak to Bug**. It **resists Poison and Psychic** and maintains a total **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack, Hoopa utilizes **Hyperspace Hole** (a signature move that never misses and strikes through *Protect*), **Shadow Ball** for secondary STAB, **Psyshock** to target the opponent's physical defense, and **Focus Blast** to provide essential coverage against the Dark-type Pokémon that threaten it.
* **Abilities:** **Magician** (This ability allows Hoopa to steal the held item of any Pokémon it hits with a move, provided Hoopa is not already holding an item, adding a layer of tactical disruption to its offensive pressure).

## Evolution & Biology
Hoopa is a standalone Mythical Pokémon and does not belong to a traditional evolutionary line. However, it undergoes a significant **Forme Change** rather than evolution. By using the **Prison Bottle** key item, Hoopa Confined transforms into Hoopa Unbound for three days (or until deposited in a PC in older generations), significantly boosting its Attack, Special Attack, and Speed stats. As a Mythical entity, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group and cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is unique; the rings on its body are not merely ornaments but are spatial anchors that connect different dimensions, a trait that makes it one of the most dangerous entities in the Pokémon multiverse.
