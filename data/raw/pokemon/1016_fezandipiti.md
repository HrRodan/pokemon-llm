## Identity & Lore
Fezandipiti (Pokedex #1016) is the Retainer Pokémon, a legendary avian species first discovered in the land of Kitakami within the Generation IX (Paldea) expansion. This elegant, pheasant-like Pokémon is characterized by its sleek black plumage and the distinctive, shimmering purple toxic chain wrapped around its neck and torso. According to Kitakami folklore, Fezandipiti is one of the "Loyal Three," alongside Okidogi and Munkidori, though historical accounts suggest its beautiful appearance and mesmerizing voice are not natural but are instead the result of toxic stimulants emanating from its chain. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is recognized as a unique Legendary entity with deep ties to the myth of Ogerpon and the Teal Mask.

## Evolution & Biology
Fezandipiti is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is a member of the "No Eggs" group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is inextricably linked to its toxic chain, which serves as both a source of its supernatural beauty and its lethal combat prowess. In the wild (specifically the Kitakami region), it is known to be a "slow" growth rate Pokémon, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its avian anatomy and "Wings" body shape, its Fairy typing gives it a mystical edge over other Flying-type competitors.
