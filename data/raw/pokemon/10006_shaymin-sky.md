## Identity & Lore
Sky Forme Shaymin (Pokedex #10006) is the Sky variant of the Mythical Gratitude Pokémon, originally discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). Unlike its land-bound form, which resembles a small hedgehog, this form is a slender, canine-like creature with petal-like ears that function as wings. According to legend, Shaymin takes to the sky to express deep gratitude, leaving behind fields of blooming flowers in its wake. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, the Sky Forme itself is a temporary transformation triggered by environmental factors. It is frequently associated with the Gracidea flower, a rare bloom that catalyzes its metamorphosis from its "Land Forme" to this high-speed aerial variant.

## Evolution & Biology
Shaymin is a unique Mythical Pokémon that does not follow a standard multi-stage evolutionary line. Instead, it undergoes a **Forme Change**. It transitions from its Land Forme into Sky Forme when **exposed to the Gracidea flower during the daytime**. It will revert to its Land Forme at night, if it becomes Frozen in battle, or if it is deposited into a PC storage system. Biologically, it is a quadruped of the "Green" color category. Despite its powerful presence, it belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. It has a medium-slow growth rate and a base happiness of 100, reflecting its status as the Gratitude Pokémon.
