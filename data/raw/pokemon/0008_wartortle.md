## Identity & Lore
Wartortle (Pokedex #008) is the Turtle Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its indigo blue color and the fur-covered ears and tail, this Pokémon is a symbol of longevity; elderly people often admire its tail as a sign of long life. As it ages, the fur on its tail deepens in color, and scratches on its shell serve as evidence of past battles. In the wild, Wartortle inhabits the water's edge, often hiding in the water to stalk unwary prey. It utilizes its large, wing-like ears to maintain balance while swimming at high speeds and can store air in its fur for extended underwater diving. While Wartortle itself does not change form, it is the precursor to Blastoise, which is capable of both Mega Evolution and Gigantamaxing.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Torrent:** Powers up Water-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Rain Dish (Hidden):** The Pokémon gradually regains HP in rain.
