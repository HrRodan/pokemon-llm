## Identity & Lore
Manectric (Pokedex #310) is the **Discharge Pokémon**, first introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. A quadrupedal, canine-like creature with a distinct yellow and blue color palette, Manectric is found primarily in grasslands where it creates thunderclouds during battle. According to its biology, it constantly collects electricity in its mane, often discharging sparks that can accidentally ignite forest fires. While not listed in its standard forms, Manectric is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Manectric using a Manectite, which drastically alters its silhouette into a lightning-bolt shape and grants it the Intimidate ability.

*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Electric-type**, it is **weak to Ground** and **resists Flying, Steel, and Electric**.

    *   **Lightning Rod:** Draws in all single-target Electric-type moves to itself, nullifying the damage and boosting its Special Attack by one stage.
    *   **Minus (Hidden):** Increases Special Attack if an ally has the Plus or Minus ability (primarily useful in Double Battles).

## Evolution & Biology
Manectric is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Electrike** starting at **Level 26**. It belongs to the **Field** (listed as "ground" in data) Egg Group, with a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. Its growth rate is considered slow, requiring significant experience to reach level 100.
