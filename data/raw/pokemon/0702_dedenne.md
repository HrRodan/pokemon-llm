## Identity & Lore
Dedenne (Pokedex #702) is the Antenna Pokémon, a small, bipedal rodent first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. This round, orange Pokémon is easily identified by its prominent whiskers, which serve as sophisticated sensors. By sending and receiving electrical waves, Dedenne can communicate with allies over vast distances, effectively acting as a living transmitter. It is frequently observed sneaking into human habitations to siphon electricity from wall outlets using its tail, which functions as a grounding wire. While it is a member of the "Pikachu-clone" lineage, Dedenne holds the distinction of being the first Pokémon to possess the Electric/Fairy typing. Despite its popularity, Dedenne does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants.
