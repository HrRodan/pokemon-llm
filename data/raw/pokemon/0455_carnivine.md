## Identity & Lore
Carnivine (Pokédex #455) is the Bug Catcher Pokémon, a predatory Grass-type entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Resembling a large Venus flytrap, this green, tentacled creature is notoriously deceptive. It binds its body to tree branches using its root-like tentacles to hang motionless, mimicking vegetation. According to Pokédex lore, Carnivine attracts prey—typically insects and small bugs—using sweet-smelling saliva before clamping its massive jaws shut; it reportedly takes a full day to consume its catch. Native to marshy environments like Sinnoh's Great Marsh, Carnivine is a standalone species with no known Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms.
