## Identity & Lore
Araquanid (#752) is the Water Bubble Pokémon, a formidable semi-aquatic arachnid first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This distinct species is characterized by the massive, shimmering bubble of water it wears around its head, which allows it to breathe on land and protects its soft vulnerable parts. While it has a somewhat sinister reputation—frequently using its bubble to suck in and drown small Pokémon—it is also known to be surprisingly caring, often protecting Dewpider by allowing them to rest within its bubble. Standing at 1.8 meters, this green, armored predator is a master of both lakes and shorelines. While Araquanid does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its unique biological traits make it one of the most specialized environmental controllers in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 70, Defense 92, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 132, Speed 42.
* **Archetype:** Specially Defensive Tank / Trick Room Sweeper. Despite its modest Attack stat, its signature ability allows it to hit significantly harder than its base numbers suggest.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Electric**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Ice**. Thanks to its ability, it also effectively resists Fire-type moves.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its Physical Attack and immense utility, key moves include **Liquidation** (to maximize Water Bubble damage), **Leech Life** (for Bug-type STAB and sustain), **Sticky Web** (to provide essential speed control for its team), and **Mirror Coat** (to punish special attackers targeting its high Sp. Def).
* **Abilities:** **Water Bubble** (A top-tier signature ability that doubles the power of Water-type moves, provides an immunity to burns, and halves the damage taken from Fire-type attacks). **Water Absorb** (Hidden Ability; provides immunity to Water-type moves, restoring 25% HP when hit by one).

## Evolution & Biology
Araquanid is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Dewpider** once it reaches **Level 22**. Biologically, it is a highly specialized Hunter-Gatherer that carries its own environment with it, allowing it to move seamlessly between deep water and dry land. It is often found carrying a **Mystic Water** to further enhance its hydrokinetic powers. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Bug** Egg Groups, and trainers should note its hatch counter of 15, indicating a moderate breeding cycle. Its sturdy, armor-like body shape provides the physical durability required to withstand the high-pressure depths of Alolan waters.
