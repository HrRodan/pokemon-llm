## Identity & Lore
Urshifu-Single-Strike-Gmax (Pokedex #10226) is the Gigantamax form of the Wushu Pokémon, a powerful Legendary creature first discovered in the Galar region’s Isle of Armor (Generation VIII). Standing at a colossal 29 meters, this form represents the pinnacle of the "Single Strike" fighting style, characterized by a philosophy centered on the absolute one-hit knockout. Its appearance is defined by its hardened fists and a terrifying aura that radiates raw power; it ignores the defenses of its opponents to land devastating, focused blows. Unlike its "Rapid Strike" counterpart, which flows like water, the Single Strike Urshifu is a relentless force of shadow and muscle. In its Gigantamax state, it gains the ability to use **G-Max One Blow**, a Dark-type move that penetrates any protective barrier, including Max Guard.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 130, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 63, Sp. Def 60, Speed 97.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker. With a massive Attack stat and solid physical bulk, it is designed to smash through defensive cores.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy-type moves**. It is also weak to **Fighting and Bug** types. However, its Dark typing grants it a complete **Immunity to Psychic** and a double resistance to **Dark**, while also resisting **Rock and Ghost** types.
* **Move Selection:** To capitalize on its 130 Base Attack, this Pokémon utilizes high-impact physical strikes. Key moves include **Wicked Blow** (a guaranteed critical hit that ignores stat changes), **Close Combat** (high-powered STAB), **Sucker Punch** (essential priority to compensate for middling speed), and **Iron Head** (critical coverage to hit Fairy-type threats).
* **Abilities:** Unseen Fist (This signature ability allows the Pokémon to land hits with contact-making moves even if the target has used defensive maneuvers like Protect, Detect, or Spiky Shield).

## Evolution & Biology
Urshifu-Single-Strike-Gmax is the final stage of a two-stage legendary evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Kubfu**, a small, earnest martial arts apprentice. Kubfu evolves into Urshifu only after undergoing rigorous training in one of the Two Towers in Galar; it becomes the Single Strike form specifically after completing the challenges of the **Tower of Darkness**. To achieve this Gigantamax state, an Urshifu must consume **Max Soup** enriched with **Max Honey**, found only on Honeycalm Island. Biologically, it is a member of the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. It possesses a "Slow" growth rate, reflecting the long, disciplined training required to master its martial arts style.
