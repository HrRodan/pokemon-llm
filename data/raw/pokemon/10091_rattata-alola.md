## Identity & Lore
Alolan Rattata (Pokedex #10091) is the Alolan regional variant of the Mouse Pokémon, a Dark and Normal-type introduced during the discovery of the Alola region (Generation VII). Unlike its Kantonian counterpart, this variant is primarily nocturnal, having evolved to inhabit urban environments to avoid predators like Yungoos. It is distinguished by its black fur, cream-colored underbelly, and prominent, tufted whiskers which it uses to sniff out high-quality, fresh food. Alolan Rattata are known to lead highly social lives, often serving as scouts for nests led by a Totem or boss Alolan Raticate. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its adaptation to the night has fundamentally changed its biological makeup and temperament, making it more cunning and aggressive than the purple-furred variety found in the Kanto region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 56, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 35, Speed 72.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker / Early-game Glass Cannon.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug and Fairy**, and possesses a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting**. However, its unique typing grants it total **immunity to Psychic and Ghost** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Attack and Speed over its Special Attack, Alolan Rattata excels with physical strikes and priority. Key moves include **Sucker Punch** (STAB priority), **Crunch** (reliable STAB damage), **Double-Edge** (high-powered Normal STAB), and **U-turn** (for scouting and pivoting out of unfavorable matchups).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Gluttony:** Causes the Pokémon to consume its held Pecha Berry or other healing berries earlier than usual when HP drops.
    * **Hustle:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% but lowers the accuracy of physical moves by 20%, significantly increasing its damage potential at a high risk.
    * **Thick Fat (Hidden):** Provides defensive utility by halving the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Rattata is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Alolan Raticate** specifically when it reaches **Level 20 during the Night**. This evolution reflects its nocturnal biology and social structure. Belonging to the **Field (Ground)** egg group, it has a relatively fast breeding cycle with a hatch counter of 15. It is a highly industrious scavenger, often found in grasslands and urban alleys where it uses its sharp incisors to gnaw through almost any material in search of sustenance. In the Alola region, its presence is often associated with the abundance of food in a specific area, as it is a discerning eater compared to the Kantonian Rattata.
