## Identity & Lore
Dewott (Pokedex #502) is the **Discipline Pokémon**, a pure Water-type entity introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**. This bipedal, blue otter is characterized by the two scallop shells, known as scalchops, resting on its hips like samurai swords. Unlike its playful pre-evolution, Dewott possesses a stoic and serious demeanor, dedicating its life to the strict mastery of the flowing double-scalchop technique. It is a highly skilled combatant that maintains its weaponry with great care. While Dewott acts as the middle stage of the Unovan starter trio, its final evolution, **Samurott**, possesses a regional variant found in the ancient Hisui region (Hisuian Samurott).
