## Identity & Lore
Espathra (Pokedex #956) is the Ostrich Pokémon, a striking and formidable creature introduced in Generation IX within the Paldea region. Standing at 1.9 meters and draped in elegant, yellow, frill-like plumage, it exudes an air of sophisticated menace. Despite its glamorous, fashion-forward appearance, it possesses an intensely vicious temperament. Espathra is known to immobilize its prey and rivals by bathing them in overwhelming psychic energy emitted from its large, piercing eyes. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is highly regarded in the competitive circuit for its unique tactical niche, often serving as a centerpiece in teams that exploit stat-boosting mechanics.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 60, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 101, Sp. Def 60, Speed 105.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Setup Sweeper. Its high base Speed combined with its signature moves makes it a "snowball" attacker that becomes harder to stop every turn it remains on the field.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Psychic-type, it is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and unique ability to lower enemy defenses, its optimal moveset includes **Lumina Crash** (a signature move that drastically lowers the target's Special Defense), **Stored Power** (which increases in damage as Espathra gains stat boosts), **Dazzling Gleam** (for coverage against Dark-types), and **Calm Mind** (to bolster its offensive and defensive presence).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Opportunist:** A signature ability that allows Espathra to copy any stat boosts an opponent grants themselves, making it a nightmare for setup-heavy foes.
    * **Frisk:** Allows the Pokémon to identify the held item of an opponent upon entering battle, providing vital tactical intelligence.
    * **Speed Boost (Hidden Ability):** Highly prized in competitive play, this ability increases Espathra's Speed stat at the end of every turn, rapidly turning it into the fastest threat on the battlefield and fueling the power of the move Stored Power.

## Evolution & Biology
Espathra is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the small, frantic **Flittle** once it reaches **Level 35**. Biologically, it is categorized under the **Flying** egg group, despite its terrestrial, ostrich-like appearance and inability to fly in the traditional sense. It has a hatch counter of 20, and its growth rate is categorized as Medium-Slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. In the wild, it is often found in the open fields and desert-like biomes of Paldea, where its speed and psychic prowess allow it to dominate its territory.
