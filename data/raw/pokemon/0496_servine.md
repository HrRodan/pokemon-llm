## Identity & Lore
Servine (Pokedex #496) is the **Grass Snake Pokémon**, a distinct evolutionary stage native to the **Unova region** (Generation V). Predominantly green in coloration, this reptilian Pokémon moves across the ground by sliding rather than walking, utilizing swift, serpentine movements to bewilder and confuse opponents before striking with a powerful Vine Whip. Servine retains small legs which are lost in its final evolution, suggesting a biological transition toward a fully limbless form. It is known for its proud and somewhat aristocratic demeanor, typical of its lineage, often keeping itself clean and avoiding direct contact with dirty environments.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 75, Speed 83.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility / Eviolite Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Grass-type**, Servine is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug**. It naturally **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** While its offensive stats are balanced, Servine excels when utilizing utility and momentum-based moves. An optimal kit includes **Leaf Storm** (massive damage potential with its Hidden Ability), **Giga Drain** (for sustain), **Glare** (rare paralysis support for speed control), and **Leech Seed** (to whittle down tankier foes).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Overgrow:** Powers up Grass-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Contrary (Hidden Ability):** Inverts stat changes. This is Servine's most competitively viable trait, turning the stat drop from moves like *Leaf Storm* into a sharp boost, allowing it to act as a setup sweeper.
