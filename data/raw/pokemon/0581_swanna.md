## Identity & Lore
Swanna (#581) is the White Bird Pokémon, an elegant avian species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its striking white plumage and graceful disposition, Swanna is often seen performing elaborate synchronized dances at dusk; in these displays, the leader of the flock occupies the central position to direct its kin. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is highly regarded for its beauty and is frequently found inhabiting the lakes and bridges of the Unova region, such as the Marvelous Bridge. Its physical design is a testament to its dual nature as both a powerful flyer and a capable swimmer.
