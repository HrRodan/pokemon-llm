## Identity & Lore
Beheeyem (Pokedex #606) is the Cerebral Pokémon, a mysterious humanoid entity first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Clad in a brown, trench-coat-like skin with a distinct head resembling a classic extraterrestrial or a "Bug-Eyed Monster" (BEM), Beheeyem is renowned for its terrifying psychic capabilities. It possesses the ability to completely rewrite or manipulate an opponent's memories, often leaving victims confused or unaware of their encounters. This Pokémon communicates not through vocalizations, but by flashing the three colored lights (red, green, and yellow) on its finger-like appendages in rhythmic patterns. Often found in remote areas or associated with UFO sightings, Beheeyem is a master of mental interference. While it does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its lore remains deeply tied to the cosmic and the unexplained.

## Evolution & Biology
Beheeyem is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Elgyem** once it reaches **Level 42**. This evolution marks a significant increase in its cerebral capacity and a shift in its appearance from a small visitor to a sophisticated, memory-altering being. Biologically, Beheeyem belongs to the **Humanshape** egg group, and trainers can expect a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. Its biological design suggests a high level of intelligence that rivals or even exceeds human capabilities, specifically in the fields of neurology and signal communication.
