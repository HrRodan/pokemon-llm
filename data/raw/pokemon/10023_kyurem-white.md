## Identity & Lore
White Kyurem (#10023) is the Boundary Pokémon, a colossal legendary entity introduced in the Unova region of Generation V. This specific form represents a state of "Absofusion," where the base Kyurem has absorbed Reshiram using the DNA Splicers to reclaim part of the original dragon that was split long ago. It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside itself, though the sheer intensity of its power causes energy to leak, freezing its own body in the process. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, White Kyurem is considered one of the most powerful beings in the Tao Trio, embodying the balance between cold emptiness and the heat of "Truth."

## Evolution & Biology
White Kyurem is a unique form-change of Kyurem rather than a standard evolutionary stage. It is achieved when Kyurem is fused with **Reshiram** via the **DNA Splicers**. This process can be reversed at any time to return them to two separate Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred, and it has a high Hatch Counter of 120, typical of legendary status. Biologically, it is a dual-natured creature, manifesting the icy tail-engine of Reshiram which glows with fire-like energy during high-intensity attacks, effectively bridging the gap between absolute zero and thermal energy.
