## Identity & Lore
Poliwhirl (Pokedex #061) is the Tadpole Pokémon, an amphibious creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Identifiable by its blue, spherical body and the distinctive black and white spiral pattern on its belly, Poliwhirl represents the transition from a purely aquatic tadpole to a land-dwelling amphibian. The spiral on its stomach is actually its internal organs visible through its thin, smooth skin; this spiral rotates slowly, capable of lulling enemies into a drowsy state. While capable of living on land, Poliwhirl prefers the water's edge to keep its skin moist. When traveling on land, it secretes a slimy, sweat-like fluid to prevent dehydration and to make its body too slippery for predators to grasp.
