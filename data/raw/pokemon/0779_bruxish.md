## Identity & Lore
Bruxish (Pokedex #779) is the Gnash Teeth Pokémon, a vibrant and striking aquatic species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This pink-colored predator is known for the colorful, gaudy patterns on its skin, which serve as a warning to other seafaring Pokémon. Bruxish possesses a unique protuberance on its head that glows with psychic energy; when it unleashes its mental power, it emits a terrifying, grating sound produced by grinding its massive teeth together. This sound is often enough to drive away potential threats or stun prey in the tropical waters it inhabits. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its presence in the Paldean seas in later generations confirms its adaptability as a fierce coastal hunter.

## Evolution & Biology
Bruxish is a single-stage Pokémon, meaning it is not part of an evolutionary line and does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group, sharing its breeding characteristics with other fish-like Pokémon such as Sharpedo and Lanturn. In the wild, it is occasionally found holding a **Razor Fang**, an item that highlights its aggressive, biting nature. Despite its thin frame, its powerful jaw muscles and psychic capabilities allow it to compete with much larger predators in its reef habitats.
