## Identity & Lore
Mega Crabominable (Pokedex #10315) is the Woolly Crab Pokémon, representing a powerful Mega Evolution of the standard Crabominable discovered in the Alola region (Generation VII). Originally starting its life as a seafaring Crabrawler, this Pokémon was driven by a competitive instinct to reach the highest point possible. This journey led it to the frozen peaks of Mount Lanakila, where the extreme cold forced its body to evolve, growing a thick, shaggy coat of white fur and developing its unique Ice and Fighting typing. In its Mega-Evolved state, its physical frame becomes even more imposing, standing at 2.6 meters and weighing over 250 kilograms. This form amplifies its brute strength and defensive capabilities, turning its claws into massive, ice-encrusted pistons capable of shattering glaciers.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 97, Attack 157, Defense 122, Sp. Atk 62, Sp. Def 107, Speed 33.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Trick Room Sweeper. With a staggering 157 Base Attack and extremely low Speed, it is a premier candidate for Trick Room teams.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Psychic, Rock, Steel, Fire, and Fairy**. It **resists Ice, Bug, and Dark-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Attack stat, Mega Crabominable excels with physical wall-breaking moves. Key selections include:
    * **Ice Hammer:** A high-power Ice-type STAB move that perfectly suits its low-speed playstyle.
    * **Close Combat:** A devastating Fighting-type STAB move to pierce through Steel and Normal-type walls.
    * **Drain Punch:** Provides much-needed sustainability, allowing it to recover HP while dealing significant damage.
    * **Rock Slide or Earthquake:** Vital coverage options to deal with Fire and Flying-type threats that capitalize on its weaknesses.
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-form abilities vary by context, it typically benefits from **Iron Fist** (which boosts the power of punching moves like Ice Hammer and Drain Punch) or **Hyper Cutter** (which prevents its massive Attack stat from being lowered by Intimidate).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Crabominable is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It begins as **Crabrawler**, a pure Fighting-type that inhabits beaches and palm trees. It evolves into **Crabominable** when leveled up in a specific high-altitude cold environment, such as **Mount Lanakila** in Alola, or through exposure to an **Ice Stone**. The transformation into its Mega form is triggered by a Mega Stone, briefly unlocking its latent genetic potential. It belongs to the **Water 3** egg group and is characterized by a "Medium" growth rate. Biologically, its fur is its most prized asset, insulating it against sub-zero temperatures and allowing it to remain active in climates where other crab-like Pokémon would perish.
