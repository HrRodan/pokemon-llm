## Identity & Lore
Meowstic (Female) (Pokedex #10025) is the Constraint Pokémon, a bipedal feline species first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. Unlike its male counterpart, which focuses on defensive support, the female Meowstic is characterized by a much more aggressive and selfish temperament. Its appearance is defined by its white and navy blue fur and the large, folded ears that hide its most dangerous feature: eye-like organs that emit immense psychic energy. According to regional lore, Meowstic must keep these ears tightly shut to contain its power; if threatened, it raises its ears to release a psychic blast strong enough to grind a 10-ton truck into dust. While Meowstic does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its extreme sexual dimorphism makes it unique in the Pokémon world, with the female variant specifically evolving to excel in offensive pressure.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 74, Attack 48, Defense 76, Sp. Atk 83, Sp. Def 81, Speed 104.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Attacker / Anti-Meta Lead.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark** types. It effectively **resists Fighting and Psychic** damage.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Speed and Special Attack, Meowstic-Female excels with a kit including **Psychic** for high-power STAB damage, **Shadow Ball** for Ghost-type coverage, **Nasty Plot** to sharply boost its offensive presence, and **Thunderbolt** or **Signal Beam** to handle various elemental threats.
* **Abilities:** **Keen Eye** prevents other Pokémon from lowering its accuracy. **Infiltrator** allows its attacks to bypass the effects of Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, and Aurora Veil. Its Hidden Ability, **Competitive**, is its most lethal tool, sharply increasing its Special Attack by two stages if any of its stats are lowered by an opponent (such as through the Intimidate ability).

## Evolution & Biology
Meowstic is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Espurr** starting at **Level 25**. The evolution is unique because the resulting form and movepool are determined by the Pokémon's gender; females develop a more offensive-oriented movepool including moves like Stored Power and Shadow Ball. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. It is a solitary and somewhat aloof Pokémon that prefers to keep its distance from others to prevent the accidental discharge of its psychic "eyes." Trainers must be cautious of its mood, as a startled Meowstic-Female may instinctively unleash its full mental force without warning.
