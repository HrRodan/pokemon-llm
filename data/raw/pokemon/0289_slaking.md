## Identity & Lore
Slaking (Pokédex #289) is the **Lazy Pokémon**, a massive Normal-type creature introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Resembling a large, gorilla-like sloth, it inhabits **forests** where it spends the vast majority of its time lying down and lolling about. According to its biology, Slaking only eats grass growing within its immediate reach and will reluctantly move to a new spot only once that food source is depleted. Despite its lethargic behavior, it stores a tremendous amount of energy by sleeping, allowing it to unleash devastating power that rivals even Legendary Pokémon when provoked.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 150, Attack 160, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 65, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** **Physical Juggernaut / Hit-and-Run Attacker**. With a staggering Base Attack of 160 and solid bulk, Slaking hits harder than almost any other non-Mega Evolved Pokémon, but is balanced by a debilitating ability that requires careful turn management.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses an **immunity to Ghost**. It takes neutral damage from all other types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Attack stat and need for burst damage, key moves include **Giga Impact** (Maximum STAB damage), **Earthquake** (Essential coverage against Rock and Steel types), **Play Rough** (Coverage against Fighting and Dragon types), and **Slack Off** (Reliable recovery to utilize its high HP).
*   **Abilities:** **Truant**. This unique and restrictive ability forces the Pokémon to "loaf around" every other turn, preventing it from using a move on consecutive turns. This mandates a playstyle often involving "Hit-and-Run" tactics or synergy with partners who can suppress abilities.

## Evolution & Biology
Slaking is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Vigoroth** starting at **Level 36**, which itself evolves from **Slakoth** at Level 18. Notably, the evolutionary line fluctuates wildly in energy levels; while Slakoth is lethargic, Vigoroth is hyperactive, only for the Pokémon to return to extreme laziness upon evolving into Slaking. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group.
