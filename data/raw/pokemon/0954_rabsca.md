## Identity & Lore
Rabsca (Pokedex #954) is the Rolling Pokémon, a dual-type Bug and Psychic creature introduced in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is characterized by its vibrant green body and the massive, glowing orb it maneuvers. Local lore and scientific observation suggest a mysterious biological inversion; while the beetle-like body supports the sphere, it remains nearly motionless, leading researchers to believe that the Pokémon’s true consciousness and "body" actually reside within the psychic ball itself. This orb is said to contain an infant-like essence, vibrating with immense telepathic energy. Inspired by the scarab beetles of ancient myth, Rabsca is often found in arid or desert-like environments where its predecessor, Rellor, rolls mud balls. While it currently lacks a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, it is uniquely distinguished as one of the few Pokémon capable of utilizing life-giving psychic techniques that can revive fallen allies.

## Evolution & Biology
Rabsca is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rellor**, the Rolling Pokémon. The evolution is unique to the Paldea region: Rellor must be walked for 1,000 steps outside of its Poké Ball using the "Let's Go" feature and then leveled up to trigger the transformation into Rabsca. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a fast growth rate. Its physical form is highly specialized for channeling psychic frequencies, and it is frequently sought after by competitive trainers for its ability to manipulate the speed dimensions of the battlefield via **Trick Room**, turning its naturally low Speed into a tactical advantage.
