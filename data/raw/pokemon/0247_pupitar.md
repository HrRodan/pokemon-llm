## Identity & Lore
Pupitar (Pokédex #247) is the Hard Shell Pokémon, introduced in Generation II (Johto). This Rock/Ground-type serves as the transitional pupal stage for the pseudo-legendary Tyranitar line. Unlike most pupa-stage Pokémon that remain stationary, Pupitar is extremely active and dangerous; its gray shell is described as being as hard as sheet rock. It possesses enough power to topple a mountain with its thrashing capabilities and propels itself around its mountain habitat using compressed gas. While it has no specific alternate forms, its final evolution, Tyranitar, is capable of Mega Evolution.
