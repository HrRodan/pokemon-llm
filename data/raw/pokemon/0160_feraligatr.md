## Identity & Lore
Feraligatr (Pokedex #160) is the formidable Big Jaw Pokémon, serving as the final evolution of the Water-type starter from **Generation II (Johto)**. Characterized by its massive, powerful jaws and blue, bipedal frame, this Pokémon is known for its savage fighting style; when it bites a victim, it violently shakes its head to tear them apart. Standing at 2.3 meters tall, Feraligatr is an intimidating predator that inhabits the **waters-edge**, moving clumsily on land but with blinding agility in the water. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is recognized as a physically dominant force in the Johto region's ecosystem.
