## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Zoroark (Pokedex #10239) is the Hisuian Form of the Illusion Fox Pokémon, a regional variant first discovered in the ancient Hisui region (Generation VIII). Unlike its Unovan counterpart, this specter is a Normal and Ghost-type, a unique elemental combination born from the resentment and malice of Zorua that perished in the harsh, snowy environments of Hisui after being driven from other lands. Its appearance is haunting, characterized by disheveled, white-and-red fur that flows like ethereal wisps of spiteful energy. According to Hisuian lore, the bonds between these Pokémon and their kin are incredibly fierce; it uses its terrifying illusions—which can cause physical harm to observers—to protect its pack from any perceived threats. While this Pokémon does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a regional variant makes it a focal point of ancient Sinnoh's biological history.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 60, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. Its high Special Attack and Speed allow it to strike first and hard, though its meager HP and Defense make it a "glass cannon" that cannot survive many direct hits.
* **Type Matchups:** It possesses one of the most remarkable defensive profiles in the game. It is **weak only to Dark-type moves**. Conversely, it **resists Poison and Bug**, and possesses a staggering **three immunities**, being completely unaffected by **Normal, Fighting, and Ghost-type attacks**.
* **Move Selection:** Hisuian Zoroark excels by using its high Special Attack for devastating damage. Key moves include **Bitter Malice** (its signature Ghost-type move which lowers the target's Attack), **Shadow Ball** for consistent Ghost-type STAB, **Hyper Voice** for high-damage Normal-type STAB, and **Nasty Plot** to sharply boost its Special Attack to sweeping levels. For coverage, it often carries **Flamethrower** to deal with Steel-types.
* **Abilities:** **Illusion** (This ability allows Hisuian Zoroark to take the appearance of the last Pokémon in the trainer's party upon entering battle. This is tactically vital for baiting Fighting or Ghost-type moves that it is immune to, tricking the opponent into wasting a turn).

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Zoroark is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hisuian Zorua** once it reaches **Level 30**. Biologically, it is a creature defined by spite, yet it maintains a sophisticated social structure within its own species. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, and researchers have noted a hatch counter of 20, suggesting a moderate breeding cycle. Despite its ghostly nature, it retains the physical agility of a fox, standing 1.6 meters tall and weighing 73.0 kg, allowing it to navigate the crags and icy wastes of its native habitat with predatory grace.
