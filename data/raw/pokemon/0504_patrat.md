## Identity & Lore
Patrat (Pokedex #504) is the Normal-type Scout Pokémon indigenous to the Unova region (Generation V). Defined by its hyper-vigilant nature, this brown, quadrupedal rodent stores food in its cheek pouches, allowing it to keep watch over its territory for days without resting. Patrat is characterized by its stiff posture and intense stare; it uses its tail to communicate signals to others of its kind. While they are extremely cautious, their focus on guarding often distracts them from attacks coming from behind. It serves as the primary early-route rodent for the Unova region, occupying a similar ecological niche to Rattata or Sentret.

*   **Archetype:** Early-Game Physical Support / LC (Little Cup) Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal type, it is **weak to Fighting** types. It possesses a critical **immunity to Ghost** type moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its slightly higher Attack stat and unique utility options, key moves include **Hyper Fang** or **Return** for STAB damage, **Crunch** for Ghost coverage, **Super Fang** to cut the opponent's HP in half regardless of defenses, and **Hypnosis** to incapacitate threats.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Run Away:** Guarantees escape from a wild Pokémon.
    *   **Keen Eye:** Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its accuracy and ignores evasion boosts.
    *   **Analytic (Hidden):** Boosts move power by 30% if the Pokémon moves last. Given Patrat's naturally low Speed (42), this is its most competitively viable ability.
