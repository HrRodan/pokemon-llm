## Identity & Lore
Electrode (Pokedex #101) is the volatile Ball Pokémon, originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). Resembling an inverted Poké Ball with a white top and red bottom, this Electric-type inhabits urban environments, specifically congregating near power plants to feed on fresh electricity. It is notorious for storing electric energy under extreme pressure; the more energy it consumes, the faster it moves, but this also makes it incredibly unstable. Lore suggests it explodes with little or no provocation, earning it the nickname "The Bomb Ball." While this profile focuses on the Kantonian standard form, a distinct regional variant known as **Hisuian Electrode** (Electric/Grass) existed in the ancient Hisui region.

## Evolution & Biology
Electrode is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Voltorb** starting at **Level 30**. There are no items required for this evolution in its standard form. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and is genderless. Biologically, Electrode thrives on consuming electricity from the atmosphere and man-made generators; when the atmosphere is electrically charged, such as before a storm, swarms of Electrode can be seen rolling through urban areas.
