## Identity & Lore
Panpour (Pokedex #515) is the Spray Pokémon, a bipedal, monkey-like creature first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. This blue-colored Pokémon is most distinguished by the tuft on its head, which acts as a reservoir for nutrient-rich water. Lore dictates that the water Panpour sprays from this tuft is so full of vital minerals that plants receiving it will grow significantly larger and healthier than usual. Panpour is part of a famous elemental trio alongside Pansage and Pansear, often given to trainers in the early stages of their journey to provide type-coverage balance. While Panpour does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it remains a staple of the Unova region’s coastal and forest ecosystems.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 53, Defense 48, Sp. Atk 53, Sp. Def 48, Speed 64.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Attacker (Little Cup). Given its balanced offensive stats and relatively high base Speed for an unevolved Pokémon, Panpour functions as a versatile early-game threat.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Panpour has access to a surprisingly diverse movepool that allows it to target enemy weaknesses effectively. Key moves include **Scald** (for STAB damage and a high burn chance), **Nasty Plot** (to sharply raise its Special Attack), **Ice Beam** (to counter its weakness to Grass-types), and **Hydro Pump** (for maximum raw damage).
* **Abilities:** **Gluttony** allows Panpour to consume a held Berry (like the Oran or Rindo Berries it is known to carry) much earlier than usual when its HP drops. Its Hidden Ability, **Torrent**, increases the power of its Water-type moves by 50% when its health is below one-third, making it dangerous in clutch situations.

## Evolution & Biology
Panpour is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Simipour** when exposed to a **Water Stone**. There is no level requirement for this evolution, meaning a trainer can trigger the transformation at any time, though it is often wise to wait until Panpour has learned specific utility moves like *Acrobatics* or *Crunch*. Panpour belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and researchers note a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its medium growth rate. It is known to inhabit areas near water sources where it can keep its head tuft replenished, and it is often found carrying **Oran Berries** or **Rindo Berries** in the wild to mitigate its natural weaknesses.
