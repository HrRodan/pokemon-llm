## Identity & Lore
Mega Starmie (Pokedex #10280) is the evolved "Mega" form of the Mysterious Pokémon, a geometric, extraterrestrial-like organism originating from the Kanto region (Generation I). This particular form represents a massive surge in energy, enhancing its core—a multi-faceted gem that glows with the seven colors of the rainbow. Lore suggests that this core serves as a high-powered transmitter, sending radio signals into the vacuum of space, fueling theories that Starmie is an alien lifeform. Primarily found in deep-sea habitats, it is known to spin its body at high speeds to propel itself through the water. While Starmie does not possess a Gigantamax form or a known Paradox variant, this Mega Evolution pushes its celestial power to its absolute zenith.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 140, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 130, Sp. Def 105, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Sweeper / Wallbreaker. With a massive Attack stat of 140 complemented by a 130 Special Attack, Mega Starmie can dismantle opponents from both sides of the spectrum.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Water/Psychic type, it is **weak to Grass, Electric, Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, Fighting, Psychic, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its immense offensive stats, Mega Starmie excels with a versatile movepool. Key selections include **Liquidation** (physical STAB), **Zen Headbutt** (physical STAB), **Hydro Pump** (high-power special STAB), and **Psychic** (consistent special STAB). Its high speed allows it to effectively utilize utility moves like **Rapid Spin** to clear hazards or **Recover** to mitigate its low HP.
* **Abilities:** While typical Starmie utilize **Natural Cure** (heals status on switch-out) or **Analytic** (boosts power if moving last), this Mega form focuses on raw output. The increased defensive stats (105 in both) allow it to survive hits that would normally faint its base form, turning it into a formidable offensive threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Starmie is the final stage of a three-stage progression. It begins as **Staryu**, an echinoderm-like creature capable of regenerating lost limbs. Staryu evolves into **Starmie** when exposed to a **Water Stone**. The transition to Mega Starmie occurs through Mega Evolution, triggered by a Trainer's Key Stone reacting with a held Mega Stone. Biologically, it is genderless and belongs to the **Water 3** egg group. Despite its rigid appearance, it is a highly mobile predator that thrives in marine environments, often washing up on shorelines after star-filled nights.
