## Identity & Lore
Joltik (Pokedex #595) is the Attaching Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Electric creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Distinguished by its diminutive stature, Joltik is canonically one of the smallest Pokémon in existence, standing at a mere four inches tall. Its biology is centered around electrical parasitism; because it cannot generate its own electricity, it attaches itself to larger Pokémon—often Yamask or Charge-stone Cave inhabitants—to absorb static electricity. In urban environments, Joltik have adapted to inhabit human residences, where they feed on the current provided by electrical outlets. Despite its small size and yellow, fuzzy appearance, Joltik is a tenacious survivor, using its silk and hooks to remain anchored to its hosts. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Galvantula, is a staple of Unovan ecology.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 47, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 57, Sp. Def 50, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Utility / Little Cup Sweeper. While its base stats are low as an unevolved Pokémon, its Speed and Special Attack allow it to function as a glass cannon in the Little Cup tier.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Rock, and Flying**. Notably, its Bug typing negates the traditional Electric weakness to Ground, making Ground-type moves neutral. It **resists Grass, Electric, Fighting, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Special Attack and its ability to boost accuracy, Joltik excels with high-powered or tactical special moves:
    1. **Thunder:** A high-power Electric move that becomes significantly more reliable when paired with the Compound Eyes ability.
    2. **Bug Buzz:** A powerful Bug-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move that can lower the target's Special Defense.
    3. **Volt Switch:** Essential for maintaining momentum, allowing Joltik to deal damage and pivot out of disadvantageous matchups.
    4. **Electroweb:** Provides excellent speed control by lowering the opponent's Speed stat upon impact.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Compound Eyes:** Increases the Pokémon's accuracy by 30%, making it one of the few Pokémon capable of using low-accuracy moves like Thunder and Sleep Powder (via breeding) with high reliability.
    * **Unnerve:** Prevents opposing Pokémon from eating their held Berries, disrupting defensive strategies.
    * **Swarm (Hidden Ability):** Increases the power of Bug-type moves by 50% when Joltik's HP is below one-third.

## Evolution & Biology
Joltik is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Galvantula** starting at **Level 36**. Biologically, the transition from Joltik to Galvantula represents a shift from a parasitic scavenger to an active apex predator capable of spinning electrified silk traps. Joltik belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group, and with a Hatch Counter of 20, it requires a moderate amount of travel to hatch from an egg. Breeders often value Joltik for its ability to pass down "Sticky Web" in later generations, a premier entry hazard in competitive play.
