## Identity & Lore
Machop (Pokedex #066) is the Superpower Pokémon, a dedicated Fighting-type native to the mountain ranges of Generation I (Kanto). This small, gray, humanoid Pokémon is defined by its tireless muscles and obsession with physical improvement. Lore describes Machop as possessing enough strength to hurl an adult human, yet it spends its days lifting boulders and gravel to bulk up further. It trains in all styles of martial arts to hone its combat prowess. Machop is often seen assisting humans with heavy physical labor due to its high endurance. While it is the base stage of its evolutionary line, its final evolution, Machamp, is capable of achieving a special **Gigantamax** form in the Galar region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 80, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 35, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy** attacks. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack stat and lack of speed, an optimal move set includes **Dynamic Punch** (high power/confusion), **Knock Off** (utility against item holders), **Bullet Punch** (to bypass low speed with priority), and **Close Combat** (raw damage output). Elemental options like **Ice Punch** provide essential coverage against Flying-types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **No Guard:** Ensures that all moves used by or against this Pokémon never miss. This creates a powerful synergy with the inaccurate move *Dynamic Punch*.
    *   **Guts:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% if the Pokémon is afflicted by a status condition (Burn, Paralysis, Poison).
    *   **Steadfast (Hidden):** Increases Speed by one stage each time the Pokémon flinches.

## Evolution & Biology
Machop is the first stage of a famous 3-stage evolutionary line within the **Humanshape** Egg Group. It evolves into **Machoke** starting at **Level 28**. To reach its final form, **Machamp**, Machoke must be subjected to a **Trade** connection. Machop has a medium-slow growth rate and is known to be extremely competitive regarding its muscular development compared to its evolutions.
