## Identity & Lore
Mega Floette (Pokedex #10296), often recognized in lore as the "Eternal Flower Floette," is the Single Bloom Pokémon originating from the Kalos region (Generation VI). While standard Floette are known to flutter around flower beds tending to wilting blooms, this specific form is tethered to a unique, dark-petaled flower containing immense power. Legend associates this Pokémon with the 3,000-year-old history of the Kalos war and the king AZ. It draws out the hidden power of its signature flower to channel devastating energy in battle. Unlike its standard counterparts, this form possesses a base stat total that rivals many legendary Pokémon, making it a singular anomaly in the Pokémon world. While it shares a lineage with Florges, this specific variant is characterized by its unique color palette and its historical significance to the Ultimate Weapon of Kalos.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Floette is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this specific form represents a biological departure from the standard cycle. The typical evolution begins with **Flabébé**, which evolves into **Floette** starting at level 19. Under normal circumstances, a Floette would evolve into **Florges** when exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. However, the "Eternal Flower" variant is noted for its inability to evolve, as its life force is uniquely tied to the flower it carries. It belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its rare and delicate nature. Its biology is centered around the symbiosis between the Pokémon and its bloom, which it uses as both a tool for healing and a conduit for high-level energy discharge.
