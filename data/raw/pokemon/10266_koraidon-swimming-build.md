## Identity & Lore
Koraidon-Swimming-Build (Pokedex #10266) is the ancient Paradox Pokémon known as the "Winged King," a title bestowed upon it in the historical Great Crater of Paldea expedition journals. While this specific "Swimming Build" represents Koraidon’s adaptation for aquatic traversal—using its powerful throat sac as a float and its sturdy hind legs as paddles—it remains a formidable legendary entity from the ancient past of the Paldea region (Generation IX). 

According to lore, Koraidon was said to have split the land with its bare fists. It is widely understood to be an ancient relative of the contemporary Pokémon Cyclizar, though its raw power and primeval aggression far surpass its modern counterpart. While the Swimming Build is primarily utilized for navigating the seas, Koraidon possesses several other manifestations, including the **Sprinting Build**, **Gliding Build**, and its true combat-ready **Apex Build**. As a Paradox Pokémon, it exudes an aura of prehistoric dominance that defies standard biological classification.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 135, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 100, Speed 135.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Wallbreaker. With a massive Speed tier and heavy-hitting physical prowess, Koraidon is designed to outspeed most of the metagame and deliver devastating blows.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Psychic, Ice, and Dragon**, with a dangerous **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Bug, Rock, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite physical Attack and its ability to set the sun, key moves include **Collision Course** (its signature Fighting-type move that deals increased damage on super-effective hits), **Close Combat** (for raw STAB power), **Flare Blitz** (which receives a massive boost from its own sunlight), and **U-turn** (to maintain offensive momentum).
* **Abilities:** Orichalcum Pulse (Upon entering battle, Koraidon summons Harsh Sunlight. While the sun is shining, Koraidon's Attack stat is increased by approximately 30%, making it one of the most terrifying physical threats in existence).

## Evolution & Biology
Koraidon is a standalone legendary Pokémon and is not part of a traditional evolutionary chain. While it shares a biological lineage with **Cyclizar**, it does not evolve from it; rather, it is a prehistoric ancestor brought into the current timeline via a time machine (or through the powers of Area Zero). 

As a legendary Paradox Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its "Swimming Build" designation, it maintains a heavy weight of 303.0 kg and a height of 3.5 meters, showcasing its massive, muscular frame. In the wild of the ancient past, it likely ruled as an apex predator, utilizing its versatile forms to dominate land, sky, and sea.
