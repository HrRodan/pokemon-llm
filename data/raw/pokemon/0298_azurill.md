## Identity & Lore
Azurill (Pokédex #298) is the **Polka Dot Pokémon**, a dual-type **Normal/Fairy** species introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. While it is classified as a Baby Pokémon and belongs to the **No Eggs** group, it is biologically unique; despite residing at the **water's edge** and evolving into Water-types, Azurill itself is not a Water-type. This blue, round Pokémon uses its large, buoyant tail to float or bounce across land, moving faster than its small legs allow. The tail is nutrient-dense, allowing Azurill to survive on stored energy during times of scarcity. Historically a pure Normal-type, it gained the Fairy typing in Generation VI.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 20, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 20, Sp. Def 40, Speed 20.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper (Little Cup) / Niche Utility.
*   **Type Matchups:** Azurill possesses distinct defensive traits, being **weak to Poison and Steel**. It holds a rare double immunity to **Ghost and Dragon** types, and resists **Bug and Dark**.
*   **Move Selection:** Despite low base stats, Azurill can be threatening by utilizing its ability. Its optimal move set includes **Belly Drum** (to maximize Attack), **Aqua Jet** (priority water coverage), **Body Slam** (STAB with paralysis chance), and **Bounce** (Flying-type coverage).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Thick Fat:** Halves damage from Fire and Ice-type moves, granting pseudo-resistances.
    *   **Huge Power:** Doubles the Pokémon's Attack stat. This is the preferred competitive ability, transforming its abysmal base Attack into a usable offensive tool.
    *   **Sap Sipper (Hidden):** Absorbs Grass-type moves to boost Attack, providing an immunity to Leech Seed and Spore.

## Evolution & Biology
Azurill is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Marill** when leveled up with **High Friendship**. Subsequently, Marill evolves into **Azumarill** starting at **Level 18**. While Azurill cannot breed (No Eggs group), it is typically obtained by breeding a female Marill or Azumarill holding a **Sea Incense**; without the incense, the egg will produce a Marill instead. Uniquely, Azurill is the only Pokémon capable of changing gender upon evolution due to disparate gender ratios between its evolutionary stages (depending on the generation mechanics).
