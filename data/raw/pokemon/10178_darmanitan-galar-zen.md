## Identity & Lore
Galarian Zen Mode Darmanitan (Pokedex #10178) is the Galarian Form of the Blazing Pokémon, representing a radical biological departure from its Unovan relatives first discovered in Generation V. While standard Darmanitan are known for their fiery tempers, the Galarian variant adapted to the frozen peaks of the Galar region, typically manifesting as a pure Ice-type. However, when its Hidden Ability is active, it enters this specialized "Zen Mode," a state where its internal fire burns at an incredible 2,500° F. This dual Ice/Fire nature creates enough physical power to destroy a dump truck with a single punch. Unlike the defensive, statue-like Zen Mode of Unovan Darmanitan, the Galarian Zen Mode is an aggressive, quadrupedal powerhouse pulsing with thermal energy. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, this Zen Mode transformation is functionally equivalent to a form change, significantly boosting its offensive capabilities and speed.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 105, Attack 160, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 55, Speed 135.
* **Archetype:** Elite Physical Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
* **Type Matchups:** It is an Ice/Fire type, making it **weak to Fighting, Ground, and Water**, with a lethal **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**. Conversely, it **resists Bug, Grass, and Fairy**, and possesses a double resistance to **Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive 160 Base Attack, it excels with high-impact physical moves. Key selections include **Icicle Crash** (STAB with flinch chance), **Flare Blitz** (high-power STAB), **Earthquake** (essential coverage against Rock and Electric types), and **U-turn** (for maintaining offensive momentum and pivoting). It can also utilize **Belly Drum** for high-risk, maximum-reward setup.
* **Abilities:** **Zen Mode** (Hidden Ability). This ability triggers the transformation from its standard Galarian form into this Zen form when its HP drops below half, simultaneously changing its typing to Ice/Fire and granting a massive boost to its Attack and Speed stats. **Gorilla Tactics** is its standard ability in its base form, acting like a built-in Choice Band, though it is lost upon entering Zen Mode.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Zen Mode Darmanitan is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Galarian Darumaka** when exposed to an **Ice Stone**. Unlike the Unovan variant which evolves via level-up, the regional Galar form requires the elemental radiation of the stone to adapt to the cold. Accessing the Zen Mode form specifically requires a Darmanitan born with its Hidden Ability. Biologically, it is a member of the **Ground** egg group. It has a medium-slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 20, making it a Pokémon that requires significant investment from a trainer to reach its full competitive potential. Its quadrupedal stance in this form allows for rapid sprinting across icy terrain, fueled by the intense heat radiating from its frozen core.
