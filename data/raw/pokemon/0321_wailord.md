## Identity & Lore
Wailord (Pokedex #321) is the massive **Float Whale Pokémon** introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Historically renowned as the largest of all identified Pokémon, this colossal aquatic beast reaches a height of 14.5 meters. Despite its immensity, Wailord's biology is akin to a blimp; it is composed of air-filled sacs that allow it to float on the surface of the water, and hypothetically, in the air. It swims languorously through the vast open sea in pods, consuming massive quantities of food in a single gulp. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its sheer scale makes it a formidable sight, particularly in the waters surrounding the Isle of Armor where full-sized specimens are often sighted.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 170, Attack 90, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 45, Speed 60.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed HP Tank / Water Spout Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water-type**, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive HP stat and equal offensive capabilities (90 in both Attack and Sp. Atk), its most devastating tool is **Water Spout**, which deals damage proportional to its remaining health. Other viable moves include **Ice Beam** for coverage against Grass-types, **Earthquake** to counter Electric-types, and **Heavy Slam**, which utilizes its 398.0kg weight to crush smaller opponents.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Water Veil:** Prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn, ensuring its Attack stat remains unhindered.
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from being infatuated, captivated, or taunted.
    *   **Pressure (Hidden):** Raises the foe's PP usage, forcing them to expend more energy to attack this high-HP sponge.

## Evolution & Biology
Wailord is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Wailmer** starting at **Level 40**. Uniquely, despite its aquatic nature and whale physiology, Wailord belongs to the **Field (Ground) and Water 2** Egg Groups. This biological quirk allows it to breed with a vast array of land-dwelling mammals, leading to famous reproductive compatibilities within the Pokémon world.
