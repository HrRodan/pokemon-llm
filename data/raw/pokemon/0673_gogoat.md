## Identity & Lore
Gogoat (Pokedex #673) is the Mount Pokémon, a large and sturdy quadrupedal creature first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. Known for its calm and empathic nature, Gogoat is famously used as a rideable Pokémon in urban areas like Lumiose City. It possesses a unique sensory ability through its horns; by gripping them, a Trainer can communicate their feelings directly to the Pokémon, allowing the two to move as a single entity. Its body is covered in thick brown fur with a distinctive leafy, green mane that thrives on sunlight, reflecting its deep connection to nature. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence in the Paldea region (Generation IX) has highlighted its resilience and utility in mountainous terrain.

## Evolution & Biology
Gogoat is the final form of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Skiddo** once it reaches **Level 32**. Biologically, Gogoat are highly adapted to mountainous environments, using their sturdy hooves to navigate treacherous cliffs. They are frequently found in herds, though their empathic nature makes them highly sought after by humans for both companionship and labor. Gogoat belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and with a hatch counter of 20, it is a relatively accessible Pokémon for breeders looking to pass down powerful physical moves.
