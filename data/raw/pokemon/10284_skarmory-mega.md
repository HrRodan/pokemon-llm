## Identity & Lore
Skarmory-Mega (Pokedex #10284) is the Armor Bird Pokémon, a formidable Steel and Flying-type avian that represents the pinnacle of Johto’s (Generation II) metallic-winged predators. In its base form, Skarmory is known for its grey, sturdy wings that appear heavy but are actually hollow and light, allowing it to navigate the rough-terrain habitats of the Johto and Hoenn regions with extreme agility. Upon undergoing Mega Evolution, this Pokémon’s metallic plumage becomes even more refined, transforming its defensive "armor" into a more aerodynamic and offensive chassis. Historically, its shed feathers were highly prized by warriors for crafting swords due to their sharpness and durability. While Skarmory does not have a Gigantamax or Paradox form, this Mega Evolution allows it to transcend its traditional role as a defensive wall, becoming a swift and lethal aerial combatant.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 140, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 100, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper / Offensive Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire and Electric**. It possesses an exceptional defensive profile, boasting **immunities to Poison and Ground**, and **resists Normal, Flying, Psychic, Steel, Dragon, and Fairy**. Notably, it has a **Double Resistance (1/4x)** to **Bug and Grass**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive 140 Base Attack and 110 Speed, Skarmory-Mega excels with high-impact physical maneuvers. Key moves include **Brave Bird** for devastating Flying-type STAB damage, **Iron Head** for a reliable Steel-type offensive that can cause flinching, **Roost** to maintain its longevity on the field, and **Swords Dance** to further boost its sweeping potential. 
* **Abilities:** While the specific Mega Ability can vary by regional discovery, Skarmory is traditionally associated with **Sturdy** (preventing one-hit KOs), **Keen Eye** (preventing accuracy loss), and **Weak Armor** (sacrificing Defense for Speed when hit). In its Mega state, these traits evolve to support its newfound offensive pressure.

## Evolution & Biology
Skarmory-Mega is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve into or from any other species through traditional leveling; instead, it achieves this temporary, high-powered state through Mega Evolution. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and is known for its slow growth rate, reflecting the time required to harden its metallic skin. Biologically, its body is built for endurance, with a hatch counter of 25, suggesting that even from birth, its metallic composition requires significant energy to develop. Despite its heavy appearance, its 40.4 kg weight and 1.7m height are perfectly balanced for high-speed maneuvers in rocky, mountainous terrain.
