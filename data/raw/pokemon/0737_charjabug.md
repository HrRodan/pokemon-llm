## Identity & Lore
Charjabug (Pokedex #737) is the Battery Pokémon, a unique Bug/Electric-type introduced in Generation VII (Alola). Appearing as a green, rectangular, bus-like larva, Charjabug functions as a living power cell, capable of storing enough electricity to power a household for an entire day. In its natural habitat within the Alolan islands, it often buries itself in fallen leaves and soil to consume humus and generate energy. It is highly valued by the people of Alola, who often use it as a portable power source on camping trips. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the essential transitional stage between the nimble Grubbin and the high-speed aerial predator, Vikavolt. Its rigid shell is surprisingly durable, protecting its sensitive internal organs while it processes the vast amounts of electricity it needs for its upcoming metamorphosis.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 57, Attack 82, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 75, Speed 36.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Doubles Support. Due to its high base Defense and access to the Eviolite item, Charjabug can become an exceptionally bulky pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire and Rock**. It notably **resists Fighting, Steel, Grass, and Electric** types. Its Bug typing neutralizes the traditional Electric weakness to Ground, making Ground-type moves deal neutral damage.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Attack stat and utility pool, Charjabug excels with moves like **X-Scissor** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Wild Charge** for powerful electric physical offense, **Lunge** to lower the opponent's Attack, and **Sticky Web** to provide crucial speed control for its team. 
* **Abilities:** Battery (This is Charjabug’s signature ability, which increases the power of its allies' Special moves by 30% in multi-battle formats, making it a premiere support choice in VGC).

## Evolution & Biology
Charjabug is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Grubbin** upon reaching Level 20. To reach its final form, **Vikavolt**, Charjabug must be leveled up in a special magnetic field (such as Vast Poni Canyon or Blush Mountain in Alola) or exposed to a **Thunder Stone** in later regions. Biologically, Charjabug is often found attached to the underside of Vikavolt, acting as an auxiliary battery to fuel the larger Pokémon's devastating railgun-like energy attacks. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, indicating a moderate breeding cycle. Its reliance on the **Cell Battery** held item in the wild reflects its physiological role as a living capacitor.
