## Identity & Lore
Mega Pinsir (Pokedex #10040) is the Mega Evolved form of the Stag Beetle Pokémon, a powerhouse originally discovered in the forests of the Kanto region (Generation I). Upon Mega Evolving, Pinsir undergoes a radical transformation, sprouting large, translucent wings that grant it a secondary Flying typing and the ability to soar through the air at high speeds. Its physical appearance remains primarily brown and humanoid, but its signature horns become even more serrated and menacing. According to its biology, if Mega Pinsir fails to crush a victim in its massive pincers, it will use its newfound aerial mobility to swing the opponent around and toss them with violent force. While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, this Mega Evolution represents the peak of its predatory evolution, turning a ground-based forest dweller into a terrifying aerial hunter.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 155, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 90, Speed 105.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Late-Game Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Bug/Flying type, it has a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**, and is also **weak to Fire, Flying, Electric, and Ice**. It maintains a vital **Immunity to Ground** and provides significant **Resistances to Fighting (1/4x) and Grass (1/4x)**, as well as a resistance to Bug.
* **Move Selection:** Mega Pinsir is designed to overwhelm opponents with raw physical power. Its most effective moveset includes **Return** (which becomes a STAB-boosted Flying move via its ability), **Quick Attack** (for priority revenge killing), **Swords Dance** (to skyrocket its already massive Attack), and **Close Combat** or **Earthquake** to provide essential coverage against Steel and Rock types.
* **Abilities:** **Aerilate** (This rare ability converts all of the Pokémon's Normal-type moves into Flying-type moves and increases their power by 20%. This effectively gives Mega Pinsir the strongest Flying-type priority move in the game via Quick Attack).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Pinsir is a single-stage evolutionary line that achieves this temporary form through the process of Mega Evolution. It evolves from a standard Pinsir when exposed to a **Pinsirite Mega Stone** during battle. Despite its lack of a permanent evolution, it is a highly prized combatant within the **Bug Egg Group**. With a hatch counter of 25 and a slow growth rate, breeding a competitive Pinsir requires patience. Its biological shape is categorized as humanoid, and it is most commonly found stalking prey in dense forest habitats.
