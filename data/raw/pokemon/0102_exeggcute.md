## Identity & Lore
Exeggcute (Pokedex #102) is the "Egg Pokémon," though despite its appearance and classification, it is biologically closer to plant seeds than avian eggs. Introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**, this unique organism consists of six individual bodies bound together by a strong telepathic link; if one is separated, the group becomes agitated and immediately seeks to reunite. Residing primarily in forests and jungles, Exeggcute possesses a deceptive fragility, with cracked shells often revealing a developed internal structure. While it originates in Kanto, it possesses significant evolutionary plasticity depending on its environment; in the **Alola region**, the environmental energy causes it to evolve into the Dragon-type **Alolan Exeggutor**, distinct from its standard Kanto form.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 40, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 45, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wall / Utility Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Grass/Psychic type, it suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug-type** moves. It is also weak to Flying, Poison, Fire, Ice, Ghost, and Dark types. However, it resists Fighting, Water, Grass, Electric, Ground, and Psychic damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its decent Special Attack and high utility potential, an optimal move set includes **Giga Drain** (for sustain), **Psychic** (STAB damage), **Leech Seed** (residual damage/healing), and **Sleep Powder** (crowd control). **Trick Room** is also a viable option to capitalize on its low Speed.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Chlorophyll:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during harsh sunlight, allowing it to function as a fast sweeper in Sun teams.
    *   **Harvest (Hidden Ability):** May restore a consumed Berry at the end of a turn (100% chance in sunshine), providing immense durability when paired with a Sitrus or Lum Berry.

## Evolution & Biology
Exeggcute is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Exeggutor** when exposed to a **Leaf Stone**. Notably, if this evolution occurs within the Alola region, it takes on the Grass/Dragon-type Alolan Form due to the abundance of sunlight. Exeggcute belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and gathers in swarms to deter predators, utilizing their combined psychic powers to overwhelm threats.
