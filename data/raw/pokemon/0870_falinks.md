## Identity & Lore
Falinks (Pokedex #870) is the Formation Pokémon, a unique collective entity first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It consists of six individual armored components that function as a single unit: one leader, known as the "brass," and five disciplined "troopers." The brass directs the troopers' movements with absolute authority, allowing the formation to change shape to navigate terrain or coordinated attacks. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its military-grade coordination and golden, sphere-like armored shells make it a formidable presence in the wild, where it is often found in mountainous or rocky environments. Its design draws inspiration from ancient hoplite phalanxes and the caterpillar-like movement of a military column.

    * **Battle Armor:** This ability prevents opponents from landing critical hits, making Falinks a more reliable defensive presence while setting up.
    * **Defiant (Hidden Ability):** This ability sharply increases Falinks' Attack stat if any of its other stats are lowered by an opponent, making it a perfect counter to Intimidate users or Defog strategies.

## Evolution & Biology
Falinks is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. Despite its appearance as six separate beings, it is biologically classified as a single organism that hatches from an egg as a complete unit. It belongs to the **Fairy and Mineral** egg groups, an unusual pairing that reflects its small, communal nature and its hard, shell-like armor. Hatching a Falinks egg typically takes approximately 25 cycles, and it is known for a medium growth rate, requiring consistent training to master its complex formation maneuvers.
