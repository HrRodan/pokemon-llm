## Identity & Lore
Psyduck (Pokedex #054) is the yellow, semi-aquatic Duck Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). It is characterized by its vacant expression and the constant gesture of holding its head, a behavior resulting from a chronic, severe headache. According to lore, when this headache becomes intense, Psyduck unwittingly unleashes powerful psychokinetic energy. Despite exhibiting these mental powers, it is often unable to recall using them, leaving it confused by the aftermath. This Pokémon inhabits freshwater environments, specifically the **water's-edge** of lakes and ponds. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Regional Forms, its unique physiology allows it to bridge the gap between Water and Psychic capabilities.

## Evolution & Biology
Psyduck is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Golduck** when it reaches **Level 33**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 1** and **Ground** Egg Groups, making it compatible for breeding with a wide variety of amphibious Pokémon. Hatching a Psyduck egg typically requires approximately 20 egg cycles.
