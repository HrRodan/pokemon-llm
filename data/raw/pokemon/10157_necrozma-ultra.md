## Identity & Lore
Ultra Necrozma (Pokedex #10157) is the Prism Pokémon, a terrifyingly powerful life-form that represents the true, radiant form of Necrozma after it has absorbed an immense amount of light energy. Appearing in Generation VII (Alola), this entity is legendary across the Ultra Space dimensions and is often referred to in ancient Alolan myths as "The Blinding One." While its base form is a fractured, black crystalline being, this Ultra form is a golden, draconic manifestation of pure light, reaching a staggering height of 7.5 meters. Historically, it is believed to have shared its light with the Alola region in the distant past before losing its power and falling into a deep slumber underground. This form is uniquely triggered through a process called "Ultra Burst," which occurs when Necrozma is fused with either Solgaleo (Dusk Mane Necrozma) or Lunala (Dawn Wings Necrozma) and utilizes the power of a specific Z-Crystal, the Ultranecrozium Z.

## Evolution & Biology
Ultra Necrozma is the final, temporary pinnacle of a complex transformation line rather than a traditional evolutionary chain. It originates from **Necrozma**, which does not evolve but can undergo "Fusion" with the mascots of the Alola region. When Necrozma uses the N-Solarizer to fuse with Solgaleo, it becomes **Dusk Mane Necrozma**; when it uses the N-Lunarizer to fuse with Lunala, it becomes **Dawn Wings Necrozma**. Only from these fused states can it undergo the **Ultra Burst** transformation mid-battle to reach its Ultra form. Biologically, it is an extraterrestrial organism composed of light-refracting crystal. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot breed, and it possesses a slow growth rate, reflecting the immense energy required to sustain its cosmic power.
