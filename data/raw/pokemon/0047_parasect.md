## Identity & Lore
Parasect (Pokedex #047) is the Mushroom Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Grass entity native to the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. This creature represents a biological singularity where a parasitic mushroom, known as Tochukaso, has completely overtaken its insect host. While the underlying insect body is orange with crab-like pincers, the creature is dominated by the massive, spotted red mushroom cap on its back. Lore indicates that the insect host is effectively a zombie; the mushroom drains its energy and dictates its behavior, driving it to inhabit dark, damp **forests** where fungi thrive. If the mushroom is removed, the host bug stops moving entirely. While Parasect does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is renowned for its potent medicinal spores and its symbiotic (or parasitic) relationship with the held items **Tiny Mushroom** and **Big Mushroom**.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 95, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 80, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Slow Physical Disruptor / Trick Room Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** Parasect suffers from significant defensive liabilities. It possesses two **Double Weaknesses (4x)** to **Flying** and **Fire** types, while also being weak to Poison, Rock, Bug, and Ice. However, it resists Ground, Grass, Electric, Fighting, and Water (depending on Ability).
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Attack stat (95) and access to the only 100% accurate sleep move in the game, its optimal kit includes **Spore**, **X-Scissor**, **Seed Bomb**, and **Leech Life** for sustain. **Swords Dance** is also a viable option to boost its offensive pressure.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Effect Spore:** Contact with this Pokémon may poison, paralyze, or cause sleep to the attacker.
    *   **Dry Skin:** A tactically valuable ability that restores HP when hit by Water-type moves or during Rain, but increases damage taken from Fire moves and causes HP loss in harsh sunlight.
    *   **Damp (Hidden):** Prevents the use of self-destructing moves like Explosion, useful for catching specific wild Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Parasect is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Paras** starting at **Level 24**. Biologically, this evolution marks the point where the parasitic fungus fully seizes control of the central nervous system of the host. It belongs to the **Bug** and **Plant** Egg Groups, and usually requires 20 egg cycles to hatch.
