## Identity & Lore
Rampardos (Pokedex #409) is the Head Butt Pokémon, a prehistoric creature resurrected from the Skull Fossil found in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). This blue, upright dinosaur is famous for its rock-hard skull, which is approximately 30 centimeters thick, allowing it to withstand impacts that would shatter mostly anything else. Historically inhabiting ancient jungles over 100 million years ago, Rampardos is characterized by its brute force and somewhat limited intelligence, as its thick skull leaves little room for a brain. It serves as the offensive counterpart to the defensive Bastiodon. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its raw destructive power makes it a fearsome entity in lore, known to knock down massive trees and smash through boulders with a single charge.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 97, Attack 165, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 50, Speed 58.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Rock** type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Grass**. It **resists Normal, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Ice** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Possessing one of the highest Attack stats of all non-legendary Pokémon, Rampardos relies on high-power physical moves. Its optimal kit includes **Head Smash** (immense STAB damage with recoil), **Earthquake** (for coverage against Steel and Rock types), **Zen Headbutt** (utilizing Sheer Force), and **Rock Polish** (to mitigate its poor Speed). **Fire Punch** is also a viable option for Grass/Steel coverage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Mold Breaker:** Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities (e.g., hitting a Levitate user with Earthquake).
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden Ability):** Removes additional effects to increase the power of moves by 30%. This synergizes well with moves like Zen Headbutt, Rock Slide, and Fire Punch.

## Evolution & Biology
Rampardos is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cranidos** starting at **Level 30**. In the context of the Pokémon world, a Trainer must usually first revive a **Skull Fossil** at a mining museum or laboratory to obtain the pre-evolution. It belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group and has a slow-then-very-fast growth rate. Its biology dictates a reckless lifestyle; because its skull is harder than steel, it charges head-first into all obstacles, leading to theories that its stupidity contributed to its original extinction.
