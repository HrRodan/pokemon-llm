## Identity & Lore
Snorunt (Pokedex #361) is the Snow Hat Pokémon, an Ice-type entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a small creature shivering under a conical straw cloak (yuki-warashi), Snorunt is naturally adapted to sub-zero environments. While they thrive in regions with heavy snowfall, biological data indicates that during warmer seasons like spring and summer, they retreat deep into caverns to live quietly among stalactites and stalagmites. Folklore in the Pokémon world often suggests that a house visited by a Snorunt will prosper for generations. While Snorunt does not possess a Mega Evolution itself, its evolved form, Glalie, is capable of Mega Evolution.
