## Identity & Lore
Mega Abomasnow (Pokedex #10060) is the Frost Tree Pokémon, a massive and formidable dual-type Grass/Ice creature that serves as the Mega Evolved form of Abomasnow. Originating from the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), this Pokémon is often referred to as the "Abominable Snowman" of the Pokémon world. It makes its home in high-altitude mountain peaks that are perpetually buried in deep snow. Upon Mega Evolving—a process triggered by the Abomasite—the sprouts on its back bloom into giant, ice-covered pillars, and its fur becomes even more jagged and shaggy to withstand the absolute zero temperatures it generates. It is known to whip up violent blizzards to conceal itself from intruders, maintaining a reclusive but powerful presence in the frozen wastes.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 132, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 132, Sp. Def 105, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Trick Room Wallbreaker. With balanced Base 132 offensive stats and a dismal Base 30 Speed, Mega Abomasnow is a premier threat under Trick Room conditions, capable of dismantling teams with both physical and special attacks.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fighting, Rock, and Steel**, and suffers from a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire**. Conversely, it **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Mega Abomasnow excels by utilizing its high offensive stats and its ability to summon weather. Key moves include **Blizzard** (which gains 100% accuracy in the snow it creates), **Wood Hammer** (a high-recoil physical Grass STAB), **Giga Drain** (for special recovery and damage), and **Ice Shard** (crucial priority to bypass its low Speed).
* **Abilities:** Snow Warning (Upon entering battle or Mega Evolving, this Pokémon summons a snowstorm/hail, which buffs the Defense of Ice-types in modern generations and ensures its Blizzards never miss).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Abomasnow is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line, further enhanced by Mega Evolution. It begins its life as **Snover**, which evolves into **Abomasnow** upon reaching **Level 40**. To achieve this specific Mega Form, an Abomasnow must hold an **Abomasite** during battle. Biologically, it is a unique hybrid of mammalian and botanical traits, belonging to both the **Monster and Plant Egg Groups**. Despite its slow movement, its massive weight of 185.0 kg and increased defensive bulk allow it to trade hits effectively. It is often found carrying **Never-Melt-Ice**, which further empowers its freezing floral attacks.
