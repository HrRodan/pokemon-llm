## Identity & Lore
Calyrex (Pokedex #898) is the King Pokémon, a legendary figure that reigned over the Galar region—specifically the Crown Tundra—in ancient times. This Generation VIII Psychic/Grass-type is characterized by its massive, glowing green crown and slender, humanoid body. Lore describes Calyrex as a merciful sovereign capable of seeing every event in the past, present, and future, using its vast intelligence to provide healing and abundant harvests to those who inhabited its domain. While its base form is diminutive and physically fragile compared to other legends, Calyrex possesses the unique ability to fuse with the steeds Glastrier or Spectrier using the Reins of Unity. These fusions result in its legendary **Ice Rider** and **Shadow Rider** forms, respectively, which are among the most powerful entities in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 80, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 80, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Balanced Support/Setup Attacker. In its base form, Calyrex functions as a versatile "Jack-of-all-trades" that can pivot between offensive pressure and team support.
*   **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug**. It is also weak to **Flying, Poison, Ghost, Fire, Ice, and Dark**. Conversely, it resists **Fighting, Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, and Psychic**.
*   **Move Selection:** Leveraging its balanced special stats and deep movepool, key selections include **Leaf Storm** for massive STAB damage, **Psychic** for reliable coverage, **Calm Mind** to boost its offensive and defensive presence, and **Giga Drain** for sustained longevity. It also has access to high-tier utility moves like **Trick Room** and **Leech Seed**.
*   **Abilities:** **Unnerve** (Prevents opposing Pokémon from consuming their held Berries, effectively neutralizing items like Sitrus or Lum Berries in competitive play). When fused into its Rider forms, it gains the composite ability **As One**, which combines Unnerve with the steed's signature offensive ability (Chilling Neigh or Grim Neigh).

## Evolution & Biology
Calyrex is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to a standard evolutionary line. However, it exhibits a unique biological synergy with two specific equine Pokémon. Through the use of the **Reins of Unity**, Calyrex can mount either **Glastrier** (becoming Ice Rider Calyrex, a Psychic/Ice type) or **Spectrier** (becoming Shadow Rider Calyrex, a Psychic/Ghost type). Biologically, Calyrex is said to have lost much of its power over centuries as people's faith in it waned, requiring the "Glistening Carrot" or "Icy Carrot" to regain its steeds. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group and has a remarkably high hatch counter, though it cannot be bred in captivity. Its habitat is exclusively the Crown Tundra of Galar, specifically the Crown Shrine.
