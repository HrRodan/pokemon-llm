## Identity & Lore
Meloetta-Pirouette (Pokedex #10018) is the Melody Pokémon, a unique Mythical entity first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. While its default state is the Aria Forme, it undergoes a dramatic physical and tonal transformation into this Pirouette Forme during combat. In this state, its hair—which resembles musical notation—is coiled atop its head like a stylist’s bun, and its aesthetic shifts from a graceful singer to a disciplined ballet dancer. According to Unovian legend, its melodies are delivered through a specialized vocalization method that allows it to manipulate the emotions of any living creature that hears it. Though it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its ability to shift between a Special-focused and Physical-focused combatant mid-battle makes it one of the most versatile Mythical Pokémon in existence.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 128, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 77, Sp. Def 77, Speed 128.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. In this form, Meloetta sacrifices its Special bulk and power for elite Speed and Physical prowess.
* **Type Matchups:** As a **Normal/Fighting** type, it is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It possesses a critical **Immunity to Ghost** and **resists Bug, Rock, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive base 128 Attack and Serene Grace ability, optimal moves include **Close Combat** (high-powered STAB), **Triple Axel** (which benefits from Serene Grace’s accuracy or secondary effect checks), **Knock Off** (for utility and coverage), and **Relic Song** (the essential move required to trigger its transformation).
* **Abilities:** Serene Grace (This ability doubles the chance of moves having secondary effects, making moves like Triple Axel, Zen Headbutt, or Fire Punch significantly more likely to trigger flinches or status conditions).

## Evolution & Biology
Meloetta is a singular Mythical Pokémon and does not belong to a traditional multi-stage evolutionary line. Instead, it utilizes a "Forme Change" mechanic. It transitions from its Aria Forme to its Pirouette Forme specifically when it uses the move **Relic Song** in battle. If it switches out or the battle ends, it reverts to its Aria Forme. Biologically, it is a genderless humanoid-shaped creature. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group and has a very high hatch counter of 120, reflecting its status as a rare Mythical being. It is often found holding a **Star Piece**, a shard of immense beauty that reflects its graceful nature.
