## Identity & Lore
Raging Bolt (Pokedex #1021) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mysterious and formidable creature introduced in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It bears a striking, prehistoric resemblance to the Legendary Pokémon Raikou, though it is characterized by an immensely long, sauropod-like neck and a cloud-like mane that crackles with atmospheric energy. According to local lore and flavor text, it is said to incinerate everything in its immediate vicinity using bolts of lightning launched from its expansive fur. This yellow, quadrupedal titan is categorized as an Ancient Paradox form, appearing primarily within the restricted confines of Area Zero (specifically the Terarium during the Indigo Disk expedition). While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Paradox Pokémon grants it a primal, raw power that separates it from modern-day species.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 125, Attack 73, Defense 91, Sp. Atk 137, Sp. Def 89, Speed 75.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Attacker / Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** As an Electric/Dragon type, it is **weak to Ground, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It possesses a diverse array of resistances, including Fire, Water, Grass, Flying, and Steel, notably maintaining a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Electric**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 137 Special Attack, Raging Bolt excels with its signature priority move **Thunderclap**, which allows it to strike first if the opponent is preparing an attack. Other vital moves include **Draco Meteor** for overwhelming STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Volt Switch** for tactical pivoting, and **Calm Mind** to further bolster its offensive and defensive special presence.
* **Abilities:** Protosynthesis (This ability increases the Pokémon's highest stat—typically Special Attack for Raging Bolt—by 30%, or 50% if Speed is highest, when the Pokémon is holding a Booster Energy or if the weather is Sunny).

## Evolution & Biology
Raging Bolt is a single-stage evolutionary entity and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It is considered a standalone biological anomaly from a distant era. As is characteristic of Paradox Pokémon, it belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Biologically, its 5.2-meter height and 480.0 kg weight make it one of the most imposing presence on the battlefield, utilizing its height to discharge electricity from a superior vantage point.
