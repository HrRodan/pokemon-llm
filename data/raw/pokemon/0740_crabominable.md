## Identity & Lore
Crabominable (Pokedex #740) is the Woolly Crab Pokémon, a unique Fighting and Ice-type creature first discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. Originally a Crabrawler that aimed for the heights of mountain peaks to find food and power, it often became lost in the freezing altitudes of Mount Lanakila. To survive the sub-zero temperatures, it underwent a physical transformation, growing thick, insulating white fur and developing a frozen coating on its massive pincers. While its appearance is bulky and somewhat clumsy, its strength is legendary, capable of toppling icebergs or shattering boulders with its blunt-force punches. Though it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence in Alolan and Paldean snowy biomes makes it a formidable apex predator of the frost.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 97, Attack 132, Defense 77, Sp. Atk 62, Sp. Def 67, Speed 43.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Trick Room Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Steel, Fire, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Ice, Bug, and Dark**. Due to its low Speed, it relies on its high HP and raw power to trade blows.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive 132 Base Attack, Crabominable excels with moves that leverage its punching power and type coverage. Key moves include **Ice Hammer** (its signature high-damage STAB move), **Close Combat** (for maximum Fighting-type damage), **Drain Punch** (for sustainability and Iron Fist synergy), and **Ice Punch** or **Earthquake** (for reliable coverage against Fire and Steel types).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Iron Fist:** Increases the power of punching moves by 20%, making Ice Hammer and Drain Punch devastating.
    * **Hyper Cutter:** Prevents the Pokémon's Attack stat from being lowered by opponents, crucial for maintaining its wallbreaking potential.
    * **Anger Point (Hidden):** Maximize Attack to +6 stages instantly if hit by a critical hit, turning it into a terrifying threat if it survives the blow.

## Evolution & Biology
Crabominable is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Crabrawler** when leveled up at **Mount Lanakila** in its home region of Alola; in later generations (such as Paldea), this evolution is triggered by exposing Crabrawler to an **Ice Stone**. Biologically, the transition from a pure Fighting-type to a dual Ice-type is a rare example of environmental adaptation. It belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group and is known to be quite heavy, weighing 180.0 kg, which powers up moves like **Heat Crash** or **Heavy Slam** used against it, but also enhances its own **Body Press**. Its fur is not just for warmth but also acts as a dampener for the impact of its own powerful strikes.
