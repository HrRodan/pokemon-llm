## Identity & Lore
Garbodor (Pokedex #569) is the Trash Heap Pokémon, a massive personification of urban waste and industrial pollution first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a bulging, green-tinted trash bag bursting with refuse, it possesses a unique anatomy where its right arm is composed of pipes that spray toxic fluids, while its left arm is used to clench opponents tightly. Its biology is driven by the consumption of garbage; the more waste it consumes, the more toxic the gases it belches from its mouth become. In the Galar region, Garbodor is capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, transforming into a mountain of discarded toys, electronics, and waste, where its signature move, G-Max Malodor, leaves opponents poisoned. While it lacks Mega Evolutions or Paradox forms, its presence in urban environments serves as a grim reminder of ecological impact.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Hazard Setter.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Poison-type, it is **weak to Ground and Psychic**. It **resists Fighting, Poison, Bug, Grass, and Fairy** types, making it a reliable switch-in against common physical attackers.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Stench:** Its foul odor may cause the opponent to flinch when Garbodor lands an attack.
    * **Weak Armor:** A tactical ability where physical hits lower its Defense but sharply increase its Speed, allowing it to transition into a late-game sweeper.
    * **Aftermath (Hidden):** A vengeful ability that damages the attacker for 25% of their max HP if Garbodor is knocked out by a contact move.

## Evolution & Biology
Garbodor is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Trubbish** once it reaches **Level 36**, reflecting the accumulation of enough waste to burst its original bag-like skin. Biologically, it is a hardy scavenger that thrives in landfills and industrial zones. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its repulsive appearance, it is known to be loyal to Trainers who don't mind its overwhelming smell. In the wild, it can sometimes be found holding valuable items like **Nuggets** or **Big Nuggets**, though competitive trainers value it for the **Black Sludge** it occasionally carries, which provides passive healing to Poison-types. It has a hatch counter of 20, making it relatively straightforward to breed for competitive use.
