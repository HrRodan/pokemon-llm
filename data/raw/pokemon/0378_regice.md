## Identity & Lore
Regice (Pokedex #378) is the Iceberg Pokémon, a Legendary Titan introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This humanoid construct is composed of Antarctic ice formed during an ice age, possessing a body so deeply frozen that even molten magma cannot melt it. Regice controls frigid air capable of reaching minus 328 degrees Fahrenheit (-200 degrees Celsius) and is typically found residing in deep caves or ancient ruins. Along with Regirock and Registeel, it forms the trio of original Legendary Titans created by Regigigas. Regice does not possess any known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms.

## Evolution & Biology
Regice is a Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot be bred. In Pokémon lore, Regice was sealed away by ancient humans due to fear of its power, often requiring the resolution of Braille puzzles to access its chamber, such as the Island Cave in Hoenn.
