## Identity & Lore
Ducklett (Pokedex #580) is the Water Bird Pokémon, first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This avian Pokémon is characterized by its light blue plumage and its remarkable proficiency as a diver. Ducklett spends much of its time navigating freshwater habitats, submerged in search of its favorite food, peat moss. When threatened underwater, it uses its feathers to spray water as a distraction to escape predators. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the juvenile stage of the elegant Swanna, representing a transition from a playful duckling to a sophisticated swan.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 62, Attack 44, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 44, Sp. Def 50, Speed 55.
* **Archetype:** Evasive Utility / Defensive Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Electric** and a standard weakness to **Rock**. Conversely, it **resists Fire, Water, Fighting, Bug, and Steel**, while maintaining a total **Immunity to Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its balanced offensive stats and utility-heavy movepool, key moves include **Scald** (for STAB damage and a high burn chance), **Air Slash** (for STAB and flinch potential), **Roost** (for reliable health recovery), and **Hurricane** (a high-power STAB move that is particularly effective in Rain).
* **Abilities:** **Keen Eye** prevents other Pokémon from lowering its accuracy and ignores evasion boosts. **Big Pecks** protects its Defense stat from being lowered by opponents. Its hidden ability, **Hydration**, allows it to heal status conditions at the end of every turn if the weather is raining.

## Evolution & Biology
Ducklett is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Swanna** once it reaches **Level 35**. Biologically, Ducklett is a highly versatile species, belonging to both the **Water 1** and **Flying** Egg Groups. This allows it to inherit a wide variety of "Egg Moves" through breeding. Trainers typically find them near drawbridges or large bodies of water, and they require a standard growth cycle with a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles.
