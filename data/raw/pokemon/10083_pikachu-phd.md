## Identity & Lore
PhD Pikachu (Pokedex #10083) is a specialized variant of the Mouse Pokémon, recognized as one of the "Cosplay Pikachu" variants originally appearing in the Hoenn region (Generation VI). Dressed in a scholarly lab coat and glasses, this Electric-type is a standout in the Forest habitat. While the Pikachu species originated in Generation I (Kanto), this specific form represents a high-intelligence persona used in Pokémon Contests, specifically designed to excel in the "Clever" category. Lore suggests that when several of these Pokémon gather, their collective electricity can build and trigger massive lightning storms. Beyond its academic attire, the Pikachu species is known to possess a powerful **Gigantamax form**, which transforms it into a towering, "chunky" silhouette with a glowing tail, and it has access to unique Z-Moves like *Catastropika*.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 55, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Fast Utility/Mixed Attacker. With its high base Speed and the ability to hold a **Light Ball** (doubling its Attack and Sp. Atk), PhD Pikachu becomes a glass cannon that can outpace many opponents.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground** and **resists Flying, Steel, and Electric**. It has no double weaknesses but possesses very low defensive bulk, making it vulnerable to any neutral physical hit.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Speed and special contest-move access, key moves include **Electric Terrain** (its signature move for the Clever category which boosts Electric power), **Thunderbolt** (reliable high-damage STAB), **Volt Switch** (to pivot out of danger), and **Nuzzle** (for guaranteed paralysis and speed control).
* **Abilities:** **Static** (provides a 30% chance to paralyze attackers upon making contact) and **Lightning Rod** (Hidden Ability; provides immunity to Electric-type moves and boosts Sp. Atk when hit by one, making it an excellent switch-in against Electric-type users).

## Evolution & Biology
PhD Pikachu is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though as a "Cosplay" variant, it is historically unique and does not evolve into Raichu while in this form. The standard species lineage begins with **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+)**. Under normal circumstances, a Pikachu would evolve into **Raichu** (or Alolan Raichu) when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** Egg Groups, and while it has a relatively fast Hatch Counter of 10, Cosplay variants are typically obtained through special events or Contest Hall gifts rather than traditional breeding. Its biology is centered around its red cheek pouches, which serve as storage cells for electricity that it discharges through its tail or by nuzzling.
