## Identity & Lore
Galarian Zigzagoon (#10174) is the Galarian Form of the Tiny Raccoon Pokémon, a regional variant that many researchers believe is the original, primitive form of the species. Found throughout the Galar region (Generation VIII), this Pokémon is characterized by its striking black-and-white fur and a restless, aggressive disposition. Unlike the more docile Hoennian variant, Galarian Zigzagoon is known for charging into people and other Pokémon to provoke a fight, moving in a distinctive zig-zag pattern that makes it difficult to track. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form of its own, it is biologically unique as the only Zigzagoon variant capable of evolving into a third-stage form, Obstagoon, an evolution born from the harsh competitive environment of Galar.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Zigzagoon is the first stage of a three-stage regional evolutionary line. It evolves into **Galarian Linoone** starting at Level 20. In a unique biological development exclusive to the Galar region, Galarian Linoone can further evolve into **Obstagoon** when it reaches Level 35 or higher, but only if the level-up occurs during the **Night**. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** egg group, and its biology is defined by an insatiable curiosity; it restlessly wanders through grasslands and urban areas, becoming instantly interested in any movement or object it encounters.
