## Identity & Lore
Nickit (Pokedex #827) is the Fox Pokémon, a cunning and lithe Dark-type introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). Recognizable by its reddish-brown fur, dark "mask" markings around its eyes, and large, tufted ears, Nickit is a master of urban and rural stealth. Aided by the soft, velvety pads on its feet, it moves with absolute silence to raid the food stores of other Pokémon and unsuspecting humans. It is famously cautious, using its tail to brush away its footprints as it retreats, ensuring it cannot be tracked. While Nickit does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form itself, its evolved form, Thievul, shares its reputation as a notorious "gentleman thief" of the Galar region.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Early-game Special Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dark-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Bug, and Fairy**. It **resists Ghost and Dark**, and possesses a complete **immunity to Psychic** damage.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its low base stat total, Nickit utilizes its superior Special Attack and Speed to disrupt opponents. Key moves include **Snarl** (to lower enemy Sp. Atk), **Mud Shot** (for speed control and coverage), **Nasty Plot** (to boost its offensive presence), and **Swift** (for a guaranteed hit).
* **Abilities:** **Run Away** (enables a sure getaway from wild encounters); **Unburden** (doubles Speed if the Pokémon's held item is consumed or lost); **Stakeout** (Hidden Ability: doubles the damage dealt to a target that has just switched into battle, making Nickit a dangerous threat against switching opponents).

## Evolution & Biology
Nickit is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Thievul** starting at **Level 18**. Biologically, Nickit is highly adapted for survival on the fringes of human society, often found in the Wild Area or along Route 1 and 2 in Galar. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and has a fast growth rate, allowing it to reach its evolved state quickly. Its behavior is defined by its diet; it rarely hunts for itself, preferring to live off its "ill-gotten gains" stolen from others.
