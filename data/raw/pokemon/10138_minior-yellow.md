## Identity & Lore
Minior (Yellow Core) (Pokedex #10138) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique celestial being that originates from the Earth's ozone layer. This specific variant represents the Yellow Core form, one of seven possible internal colors determined by the specific composition of dust and particles it consumes while drifting in the stratosphere. In the Alola region (Generation VII), where it was first discovered, Minior is known to hurtle toward the planet's surface like a shooting star when the heavy, rocky shell it builds around itself becomes too dense. While it remains encased in its brown stony exterior, it is incredibly hardy, but once that shell shatters, the core is exposed, revealing its vibrant color and a surprising increase in speed and aggression. Although Minior does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its entire biological gimmick revolves around its "Shields Down" transformation, which fundamentally alters its combat role mid-battle.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Shell Smash Sweeper. In this Core Form, Minior sacrifices its defensive bulk for significant boosts to its offensive presence and initiative.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Bug**, and possesses a vital **Immunity to Ground** due to its Flying sub-typing.
* **Move Selection:** Minior excels by using its stats to set up and then overwhelm opponents. Key moves include **Shell Smash** (to double its offensive stats and speed), **Acrobatics** (which deals massive damage if its held item is consumed), **Power Gem** (a reliable Special Rock STAB), and **Earthquake** (essential coverage against Steel and Rock types).
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon remains in its Meteor Form—with high defenses and immunity to status conditions—while above 50% HP. When HP drops below half, the shell breaks, transforming it into this Core Form, which has drastically higher Attack, Special Attack, and Speed).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is part of a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon species. However, it is a biologically complex organism with two distinct states: the Meteor Form and the Core Form. While in its Meteor Form, it appears as a generic brown rock with four protrusions; once the shell is compromised, it reveals its star-like Core. The Yellow Core variant is purely a cosmetic distinction within the species, though all colors share the same base statistics. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its celestial origin, it can be bred in captivity, though it is genderless. It has a hatch counter of 25, making it a relatively time-intensive Pokémon to breed for competitive use.
