## Identity & Lore
Incineroar (#727) is the Heel Pokémon, a ferocious bipedal feline that serves as the final evolution of the Alolan Fire-type starter. Originating in the Alola region (Generation VII), Incineroar is heavily inspired by professional wrestling, specifically the "heel" or villainous persona. Its design features a "flame belt" around its waist, produced from an internal flame organ, which it uses to unleash devastating fire attacks. While its disposition is often described as violent and selfish—frequently ignoring orders from its Trainer when not in the mood—it secretly thrives on the adoration of a crowd and possesses a hidden soft spot for young Pokémon and children. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is iconic for its signature Z-Move, Malicious Moonsault, which it performs using Incinium Z.

* **Move Selection:** Incineroar excels when using its high Physical Attack and utility-based movepool. Key moves include **Flare Blitz** for massive STAB damage, **Darkest Lariat** to ignore the opponent's stat changes, **Fake Out** to provide immediate flinch pressure upon switching in, and **Parting Shot** to lower enemy offenses while pivoting to a teammate.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Blaze:** Powers up Fire-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third, allowing for desperate, high-damage comebacks.
    * **Intimidate (Hidden Ability):** Upon entering battle, it lowers the Attack stat of all opposing Pokémon. This ability is the cornerstone of Incineroar's legendary status in competitive VGC play, allowing it to neuter physical threats repeatedly.

## Evolution & Biology
Incineroar is the final form of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Litten**, the Fire Cat Pokémon. Litten evolves into the agile **Torracat** starting at Level 17. The transition to its final form occurs when Torracat reaches **Level 34**, at which point it develops its bipedal stance and "heel" wrestling persona as **Incineroar**. Biologically, it is a member of the **Ground (Field)** egg group. It has a medium-slow growth rate and is known for its incredible physical durability, which is reflected in its high base HP and balanced defensive stats.
