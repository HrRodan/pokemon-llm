## Identity & Lore
Passimian (Pokedex #766) is the Teamwork Pokémon, a formidable simian species first discovered in the tropical Alola region during Generation VII. This white-furred, lemur-like combatant is distinguished by its upright posture and the large, hard-shelled berries it carries, which it utilizes as both a nutritional source and a projectile weapon. Passimian live in troops of approximately 20 individuals, governed by a strict hierarchy where the leader assigns roles and coordinates tactical training. Their lore emphasizes an unbreakable mutual bond; they never abandon a comrade in battle and use complex berry-throwing techniques to communicate and overwhelm foes. While Passimian does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, it is frequently cited as the biological rival to Oranguru, representing the physical prowess of the forest in contrast to Oranguru's mental acuity.

## Evolution & Biology
Passimian is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. Despite its lack of evolution, it is a highly specialized biological entity belonging to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. Breeding efforts require approximately 20 hatch cycles (5,140–5,397 steps) to produce an egg. Biologically, Passimian are renowned for their coordination; the "Teamwork" genus refers to their habit of passing berries between troop members with such precision that they can strike moving targets from great distances. They are often found in lush jungle environments where they compete for territory and resources, using their 82.8kg frame and 2.0m height to intimidate smaller arboreal Pokémon.
