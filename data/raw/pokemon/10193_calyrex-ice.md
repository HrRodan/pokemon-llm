## Identity & Lore
Ice Rider Calyrex (Pokedex #10193) is the King Pokémon, a legendary fusion of the sovereign Calyrex and the fierce steed Glastrier. Appearing in the Crown Tundra of the Galar region (Generation VIII), this form represents the King of Bountiful Harvests at the peak of its restored power. While Calyrex itself is a green-colored, humanoid-like deity known for its high intelligence and mercy, the Ice Rider form grants it a massive, frost-armored physical presence that weighs over 800 kilograms. Lore states that Calyrex reigned over ancient Galar, providing healing and blessings to the land and its people. By mounting Glastrier using the Reins of Unity, it can freeze the atmosphere to create massive icicles. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, this specific fusion is considered one of the most powerful entities in the Pokémon world, alongside its counterpart, Shadow Rider Calyrex.

## Evolution & Biology
Ice Rider Calyrex is a unique legendary fusion rather than a traditional evolution. It is formed when **Calyrex** is combined with **Glastrier** using the **Reins of Unity** key item. The process is reversible, allowing the two Pokémon to exist independently. Calyrex is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, the fusion allows Calyrex to use its psychic powers to communicate and manifest the raw, frigid energy of Glastrier, transforming the horse's icy mane into a powerful weapon. Its slow growth rate and legendary status make it a rare sight, typically found only in the deepest, snow-covered reaches of the Crown Tundra.
