## Identity & Lore
Weedle (Pokedex #013) is the Hairy Bug Pokémon, a small, larval creature first introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This brown, segmented Pokémon is commonly found inhabiting forests and tall grass, where it feeds voraciously on leaves to prepare for metamorphosis. It is characterized by the sharp, 2-inch venomous stinger on its head, which serves as a primary defense mechanism against bird Pokémon. While Weedle itself is a base form, it is the initial stage of the Beedrill line; its final evolution is capable of achieving Mega Evolution (Mega Beedrill) when exposed to Beedrillite.
