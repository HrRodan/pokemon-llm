## Identity & Lore
Metang (Pokedex #375) is the Steel/Psychic-type Iron Claw Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Distinguished by its blue, metallic exoskeleton, this Pokémon is formed when two Beldum fuse together via a magnetic nervous system. By linking the brains of its pre-evolutions magnetically, Metang generates immense psychokinetic power and intelligence. It typically inhabits rough terrain where its sturdy body can withstand harsh conditions. While it is not the final stage, it is the predecessor to the pseudo-legendary Metagross, which is capable of Mega Evolution.

## Evolution & Biology
Metang is the intermediate stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Beldum** starting at **Level 20** and evolves into the formidable **Metagross** starting at **Level 45**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and is known for its incredibly low catch rate, making it difficult for trainers to acquire in the wild.
