## Identity & Lore
Goomy (Pokedex #704) is the Soft Tissue Pokémon, a unique and endearing Dragon-type first discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. Often described as the weakest Dragon-type Pokémon, Goomy’s body is composed mostly of water, covered by a slimy, germ-laden membrane that allows it to deflect physical strikes. It thrives in damp, shady environments like swamps and marshes to prevent its sensitive skin from drying out. While it may appear unassuming, Goomy is the initial form of a powerful "Pseudo-Legendary" lineage. In the ancient Hisui region, Goomy evolves into a distinct regional form, Hisuian Sliggoo, which gains a metallic shell. Its purple, squiggle-like body is famously sensitive, and its horns serve as sophisticated radar organs to sense danger.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 50, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 75, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Low-Tier Special Tank. While its overall base stat total is low, Goomy possesses a disproportionately high Special Defense for a first-stage Pokémon.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides valuable utility by **resisting Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its slightly higher Special Attack and its potential for coverage, key moves include **Dragon Pulse** for consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Draco Meteor** for a powerful tactical nuke, **Sludge Wave** to check incoming Fairy-type threats, and **Muddy Water** or **Hydro Pump** for environmental coverage.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sap Sipper:** Grants immunity to Grass-type moves and raises Attack when hit by one; a vital tool for switching into spores or leaf-based attacks.
    * **Hydration:** Heals all status conditions at the end of a turn if it is raining, making it a staple for "Rain Dance" teams.
    * **Gooey (Hidden Ability):** Lowers the Speed of any opponent that hits Goomy with a contact move, providing excellent speed control.

## Evolution & Biology
Goomy is part of a three-stage evolutionary line characterized by one of the highest level-up requirements among non-legendary Pokémon. It evolves into **Sliggoo** starting at Level 40. To reach its final form, **Goodra**, it must reach Level 50 while the overworld weather is **Rain or Fog** (a unique biological trigger). It belongs to the **Dragon** egg group and has a slow growth rate, requiring significant investment from trainers. Biologically, Goomy often carries the **Shed Shell** item, which allows it to escape from trapping moves and abilities, reflecting its slippery and elusive nature in the wild.
