## Identity & Lore
Ursaluna (Pokedex #901) is the Peat Pokémon, a massive, quadrupedal evolution of Ursaring first discovered in the Hisui region (Generation VIII). According to local lore, the swampy terrain of ancient Sinnoh provided the environmental pressure necessary for Ursaring to gain its burly physique and the unique capacity to manipulate peat at will. Its body is heavily armored with hardened mud, protecting it from harsh conditions and making it a formidable presence in the Crimson Mirelands. While this form is a relic of the past, a specialized biological divergent known as **Bloodmoon Ursaluna** has been discovered in the modern era within the land of Kitakami, though the standard Ursaluna remains the physical powerhouse of the lineage.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Status-Driven Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Ice, and Fighting**. It **resists Poison and Rock**, and possesses two invaluable **immunities to Electric and Ghost** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its monstrous base 140 Attack and its synergy with status conditions, key moves include **Facade** (which doubles in power to 140 when the user has a status condition), **Headlong Rush** (a high-power Ground STAB), **Earthquake** (for consistent spread damage), and **Ice Punch** (to provide essential coverage against Flying and Grass-type threats).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Guts:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% if the Pokémon has a status condition; notably, it ignores the Attack-reducing effect of a Burn, making a Flame Orb the ideal held item for this Pokémon.
    * **Bulletproof:** Protects the Pokémon from some "ball" and "bomb" moves, such as Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast.
    * **Unnerve:** Disturbs the opponent and makes them unable to eat Berries.

## Evolution & Biology
Ursaluna is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Teddiursa**, which evolves into **Ursaring** starting at Level 30. To reach its final form, an Ursaring must be exposed to a **Peat Block** during the night of a **Full Moon** within the Hisui region. Biologically, Ursaluna is a master of its environment, using its keen sense of smell to track items buried deep within the mire. It belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group and is known for its slow, lumbering gait that belies its explosive physical power. In competitive play, it is often utilized under Trick Room conditions to compensate for its low base Speed.
