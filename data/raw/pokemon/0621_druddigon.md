## Identity & Lore
Druddigon (Pokedex #621) is the Cave Pokémon, a formidable pure Dragon-type introduced in Generation V (Unova). This bipedal, draconic creature is easily recognized by its vibrant red head and blue, jagged body, which is as hard as rock. According to Unovan legends and biological studies, Druddigon is a cold-blooded predator that inhabits narrow caves and tunnels. It warms its body by absorbing sunlight with its broad, serrated wings; if its body temperature drops, it becomes immobilized, making its thermoregulation a vital survival trait. Unlike many other Dragon-types of its caliber, Druddigon does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, standing instead as a powerful single-stage combatant that relies on its sheer physical durability and brute force.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 77, Attack 120, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 90, Speed 48.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Wallbreaker. While its Speed is significantly low, its high Attack and respectable dual defenses allow it to trade hits effectively.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides valuable **resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive base 120 Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Outrage** (high-power STAB), **Gunk Shot** (critical coverage against Fairy-types), **Sucker Punch** (essential priority to circumvent its low Speed), and **Stealth Rock** (valuable entry hazard utility). It also utilizes **Glare** for guaranteed paralysis to control the speed of the battlefield.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Rough Skin:** Damages any opponent that makes contact with Druddigon, making it a punish-heavy physical tank.
    * **Sheer Force:** Removes secondary effects from moves (like the flinch chance on Iron Head) to boost their damage by 30%.
    * **Mold Breaker (Hidden):** Allows Druddigon to ignore the abilities of opponents, such as hitting Levitate users with Earthquake or bypassing Sturdy.

## Evolution & Biology
Druddigon is a single-stage evolutionary line, meaning it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. This makes it a "base" powerhouse that is battle-ready immediately upon capture. It is biologically unique for its skin, which is often described as being tougher than many armored Pokémon. It belongs to the **Dragon and Monster** Egg Groups, and while it is a fierce predator in the wild, it can be bred by experienced Trainers with a Hatch Counter of 30. It is often found holding a **Dragon Fang**, which further boosts its draconic offensive capabilities.
