## Identity & Lore
Klinklang (Pokedex #601) is the Gear Pokémon, a sophisticated mechanical lifeform first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Composed of multiple interlocking metallic gears, its most vital component is the gear with the red core, which acts as a power generator. By rotating this core at extreme velocities, Klinklang can rapidly charge its energy reserves for devastating kinetic and electrical discharges. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it remains unique in the Pokémon world for its purely inorganic biology and its mastery of gear-based weaponry. Its grey, metallic body is a common sight in industrial areas where it hums with constant rhythmic motion.

## Evolution & Biology
Klinklang is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The process begins with **Klink**, which evolves into **Klang** upon reaching **Level 38**. Klang then evolves into the final **Klinklang** starting at **Level 49**. Biologically, this Pokémon does not eat organic food, instead generating all its required life energy through the friction of its rotating parts. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its mechanical nature, it can be bred in captivity, requiring a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles to produce a new Klink.
