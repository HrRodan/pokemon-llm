## Identity & Lore
Lurantis (Pokedex #754) is the Bloom Sickle Pokémon, a fascinating specimen first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. Despite its distinct insectoid appearance which closely resembles a praying mantis, Lurantis is a pure Grass-type, utilizing its petal-like appendages as sharp, sickle-shaped blades. Its elegant, humanoid form and vivid pink coloration require significant grooming and maintenance, leading many trainers to keep it as a sign of prestige or as a dedicated hobby. In the lush jungles of Alola, it is often seen standing still to mimic a flower before striking with its scythes. Notably, Lurantis served as a formidable Totem Pokémon in the Lush Jungle of Akala Island, guarded by its precursor, Fomantis. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique biology allows it to harness solar energy more efficiently than almost any other non-legendary Pokémon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 105, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 90, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Contrary Wallbreaker / Physical Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice.** It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Lurantis excels when leveraging its high Attack and signature mechanics. Key moves include **Solar Blade**, its devastating signature physical move that charges in the sun; **Superpower**, which becomes a buffing move under its Hidden Ability; **Leaf Storm**, used to rapidly boost Special Attack; and **Synthesis**, providing essential recovery to compensate for its low Speed.
* **Abilities:** **Leaf Guard** prevents status conditions during harsh sunlight. Its Hidden Ability, **Contrary**, is its most competitive asset, causing stat reductions (like those from Superpower or Leaf Storm) to become stat boosts instead, turning Lurantis into a snowballing offensive threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Lurantis is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Fomantis** once it reaches **Level 34**, provided the evolution occurs during the **Daytime**. As a member of the **Plant** egg group, it is closely related to other botanical species, though its behavior is more predatory. Lurantis often carries a **Miracle Seed** in the wild to further enhance its chlorophyl-based attacks. Its biology is heavily tied to the sun; it requires intense light to maintain its brilliant hues and to power its most potent physical techniques. While it lacks the high speed of actual insect predators, its bulk and ability to manipulate stat changes through its nervous system make it a deceptive and dangerous opponent in long-form engagements.
