## Identity & Lore
Xatu (Pokedex #178) is the dual-type Psychic/Flying Mystic Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Resembling a living totem pole, this green, avian creature is characterized by its long, white wings adorned with red and yellow markings that resemble eyes. Xatu is deeply connected to temporal lore; it is said to stand perfectly still and quiet throughout the day because it is constantly observing both the past and the future simultaneously, overwhelmed by the visions it sees. Primarily inhabiting forests, Xatu meditates at sunrise and is often associated with ancient ruins and mysticism.
