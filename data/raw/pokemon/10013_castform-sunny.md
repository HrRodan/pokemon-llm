## Identity & Lore
Sunny Form Castform (Pokedex #10013) is the Weather Pokémon, a unique artificial life form created by researchers at the Weather Institute in the Hoenn region (Generation III). This specific form is the Sun-drenched variation of Castform, triggered when the Pokémon is exposed to harsh sunlight. Its molecular structure, which is normally gray and chemically unstable, shifts to a bright orange hue with a sun-like crown to protect its tiny body using the power of nature. While Castform does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its ability to manifest as a Fire-type in sunny conditions makes it a highly specialized environmental adaptation. It is primarily found in grassland habitats, though its presence is usually tied to scientific research facilities rather than wild sightings.

## Evolution & Biology
Castform is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is part of a unique biological category where its "forms" are temporary and dictated entirely by the environment. If the sunlight fades or is replaced by rain or hail, it will immediately revert to its Normal form or transition into its Rain or Snowy forms. Biologically, it is extremely lightweight (0.8kg) and possesses a versatile genetic makeup that allows it to mimic the climate. It belongs to the **Fairy** and **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Groups, and while it is an artificial Pokémon, it is capable of breeding, with a hatch counter of 25.
