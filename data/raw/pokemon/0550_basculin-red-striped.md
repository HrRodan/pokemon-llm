## Identity & Lore
Red-Striped Basculin (Pokedex #550) is the Hostile Pokémon, a relentless and aggressive aquatic species first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Characterized by its green, piranha-like body and a distinctive red stripe running along its flank, this Pokémon is infamous for its violent temperament. In the wild, Red-Striped and Blue-Striped Basculin share a bitter, ancestral feud; the two forms are so mutually antagonistic that they will engage in combat the moment they cross paths. While typically found in lakes and rivers, its fierce nature makes it a difficult catch for any unprepared trainer. Though it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, recent discoveries in the Hisui region have revealed a "White-Striped" relative capable of evolving into the powerful Basculegion, a trait that was long thought impossible for the Unovan variants.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 92, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 55, Speed 98.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Wallbreaker / Revenge Killer. Its high Speed and respectable Attack make it an effective glass cannon.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It possesses **resistances to Steel, Fire, Water, and Ice**. 
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its superior Physical Attack and synergy with its abilities, key moves include **Wave Crash** (high-powered STAB with recoil), **Liquidation** (reliable STAB with a chance to lower Defense), **Head Smash** (massive Rock-type coverage that triggers recoil bonuses), and **Aqua Jet** (essential priority to pick off weakened foes).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Reckless:** Increases the power of moves that have recoil damage (like Wave Crash and Head Smash) by 20%.
    * **Adaptability:** Boosts the STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) modifier from 1.5x to 2x, making its Water-type attacks devastating.
    * **Mold Breaker (Hidden):** Allows the Pokémon to ignore the abilities of opponents (e.g., hitting through Water Absorb or Sturdy).

## Evolution & Biology
Basculin was traditionally considered a single-stage Pokémon with no evolutionary potential in the Unova region. However, biological data indicates a link to a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Basculegion** when it sustains a significant amount of recoil damage (specifically 294 HP or more) without fainting. This unique evolution trigger reflects the Pokémon's lore of being possessed by the souls of fallen comrades who perished during the arduous journey upstream. Basculin belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and is known to occasionally carry a **Deep-Sea Tooth**, an item usually associated with Clamperl's evolution but reflecting Basculin's sharp, predatory dental structure.
