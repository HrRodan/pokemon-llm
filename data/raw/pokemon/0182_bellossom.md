## Identity & Lore
Bellossom (Pokedex #182) is the [Flower Pokémon] introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Often found inhabiting tropical areas and grasslands, this humanoid plant creature is famous for its ritualistic dances; when it dances, the petals on its body rub together to produce a pleasant, bell-like ringing sound. Unlike its pre-evolutions, which are nocturnal or emit foul odors, Bellossom is active during the day and is generally associated with bright sunlight. Uniquely, upon evolving, it sheds the Poison-type traits of its lineage, becoming smaller and pure green in color. It does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms.

## Evolution & Biology
Bellossom is part of a split 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Gloom** specifically when exposed to a **Sun Stone**. Notably, this evolution removes the Poison typing found in its pre-evolutions, **Oddish** and Gloom, making it the only pure Grass-type in the family (diverging from the Vileplume line, which requires a Leaf Stone). It belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and has a Hatch Counter of 20.
