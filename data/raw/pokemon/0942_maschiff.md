## Identity & Lore
Maschiff (Pokedex #942) is the Rascal Pokémon, a quadrupedal Dark-type creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Known for its distinctive, grumpy expression, Maschiff constantly scowls in an earnest attempt to make its opponents take it seriously; however, this effort often backfires, as even crying children are said to burst into laughter upon seeing its comical, folded face. Despite its small size and brown, bulky appearance, it possesses surprisingly powerful jaws. While Maschiff does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts, it gained significant fame as the loyal companion of Arven during the "Path of Legends" storyline in the Paldean region, where its resilience and bond with its trainer became a central narrative theme.

## Evolution & Biology
Maschiff is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable "Boss Pokémon," Mabosstiff, once it reaches **Level 30**. Biologically, it is a sturdy quadruped that relies on its sense of smell and jaw strength to navigate the plains of Paldea. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and researchers note a hatch counter of 20, indicating a moderate development period within its egg. Its growth rate is classified as Medium-Slow, requiring consistent training to reach its full potential as a pack leader.
