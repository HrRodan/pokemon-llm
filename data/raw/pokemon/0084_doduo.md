## Identity & Lore
Doduo (Pokedex #084) is the Twin Bird Pokémon, an avian creature native to the grasslands of Generation I (Kanto). Distinctive for its two identical heads and brown plumage, this Pokémon is flightless but compensates with powerful legs capable of reaching speeds over 60 mph. Biological studies suggest its two brains are connected via telepathy, allowing for perfect coordination; survival instincts dictate that one head stays awake to keep watch for predators while the other sleeps. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is historically significant as a unique anatomical specimen within the Pokémon world.
