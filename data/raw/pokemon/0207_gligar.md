## Identity & Lore
Gligar (Pokédex #207) is the Fly Scorpion Pokémon, a purple, gliding arachnid native to the mountainous regions of Generation II (Johto). Combining features of a gargoyle and a scorpion, it possesses large membranous wings that allow it to glide silently toward prey. Its predatory behavior involves flying straight at a victim's face, clamping down with its pincers, and injecting poison via the stinger on its tail. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Gligar is unique in competitive analysis due to its high synergy with the **Eviolite** item, allowing it to function as an exceptionally durable tank even before evolving.

## Evolution & Biology
Gligar is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Gliscor** when leveled up at **night** while holding a **Razor Fang**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 20 egg cycles. Despite its ability to fly, Gligar nests along cliffsides on steep mountains, relying on wind currents to travel rather than powered flight.
