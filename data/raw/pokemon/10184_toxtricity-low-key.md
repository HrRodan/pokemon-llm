## Identity & Lore
Low Key Toxtricity (#10184) is the Low Key Form of the Punk Pokémon, a unique Electric/Poison-type introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). Distinguished by its purple and blue coloration and a more melancholic, chilled-out demeanor compared to its Amped Form counterpart, this Pokémon generates electricity by clawing at the protrusions on its chest, creating a sound reminiscent of a bass guitar. It is known for its incredible musical prowess and rebellious nature, often found in urban environments or alongside trainers who appreciate its rhythmic electric pulses. Beyond its standard appearance, Toxtricity possesses a towering **Gigantamax Form**, where it wields an enormous guitar made of electricity to strike its foes with the move G-Max Stun Shock.

## Evolution & Biology
Toxtricity is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Toxel** starting at **Level 30**. The specific form it takes—Low Key or Amped—is determined by the Toxel's **Nature**. Toxel will evolve into the Low Key Form if it has a Lonely, Bold, Relaxed, Timid, Serious, Modest, Mild, Quiet, Bashful, Calm, Gentle, or Careful nature. Biologically, it is a member of the **Humanshape** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 25. Its internal electricity-generating organs are so powerful that they influence its temperament, with the Low Key form being notably more calculated and stoic in battle.
