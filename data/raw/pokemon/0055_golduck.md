## Identity & Lore
Golduck (Pokedex #055) is the aquatic **Duck Pokémon** originally discovered in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Distinguished by its sleek, blue skin and webbed appendages, this Pokémon is capable of swimming at incredible speeds, often outpacing human gold medalists. It inhabits the water's edge of lakes and rivers, where it is frequently mistaken for the Japanese mythological monster, the **Kappa**, due to its humanoid shape and the beak-like structure of its face. While purely a Water-type, Golduck possesses latent psychokinetic powers centered in the red gem on its forehead; when this gem glows, it indicates the Pokémon is using its full psychic potential. Unlike many of its contemporaries, Golduck does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 82, Defense 78, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 80, Speed 85.
*   **Archetype:** Versatile Special Attacker / Weather Utility.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack stat and move pool depth, key moves include **Hydro Pump** (high damage STAB), **Ice Beam** (coverage against Grass and Dragon), **Psychic** (leveraging its lore-based powers), and **Nasty Plot** (to sharply raise its Special Attack). Alternatively, **Scald** provides utility through burns.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Damp:** Prevents all Pokémon on the field from using self-destructive moves like Explosion.
    *   **Cloud Nine:** A unique tactical ability that suppresses all weather effects while Golduck is on the field, disrupting weather-dependent strategies.
    *   **Swift Swim (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, allowing it to function as a fast sweeper.

## Evolution & Biology
Golduck is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Psyduck** when it reaches **Level 33**. Biologically, it is far more composed than its pre-evolution, having gained control over the headaches that plagued Psyduck. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Field** (listed as Ground in some databases) Egg Groups, making it a flexible parent for breeding moves like Cross Chop or Encore onto other species.
