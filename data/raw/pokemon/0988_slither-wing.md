## Identity & Lore
Slither Wing (Pokedex #988) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mysterious and ancient being discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This creature is widely considered an ancient ancestor of Volcarona, though it trades that Pokémon's fiery flight for a powerful, quadrupedal terrestrial stance. Characterized by its lush, red-and-white plumage and large, moth-like wings, Slither Wing was first documented in the "Scarlet Book" as a primitive entity that shares biological traits with both insects and prehistoric predators. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Paradox Pokémon places it among a unique category of powerful, genderless beings found deep within Area Zero.

It exists as a temporal relative of Volcarona, though they are classified as separate species. Biologically, it is unable to breed, belonging to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group. It has a slow growth rate and a high hatch counter of 50, indicating its status as a rare and significant biological anomaly. Its physical form is notably dense, weighing 92.0 kg, which it uses to fuel physical moves like Heavy Slam and Heat Crash.
