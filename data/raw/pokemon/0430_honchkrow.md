## Identity & Lore
Honchkrow (Pokedex #430) is the Big Boss Pokémon, a dual-type Dark/Flying creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its imperious nature, this nocturnal avian is physically defined by its black plumage resembling a fedora and dress coat. True to its classification, Honchkrow operates like a mafia don; it rarely hunts for itself, instead organizing swarms of Murkrow to gather food and shiny objects on its behalf. It is strictly nocturnal, spending its days tending to its feathers in seclusion. While it commands absolute loyalty, a Honchkrow will mercilessly punish any underling that fails a mission.

## Evolution & Biology
