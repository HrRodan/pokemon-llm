## Identity & Lore
Walrein (Pokedex #365) is the Ice Break Pokémon, a massive pinniped introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This large, blue, quadrupedal creature inhabits freezing polar seas, where it is protected from the sub-zero temperatures by a thick layer of blubber. Renowned for its immense physical power, Walrein uses its formidable, elongated tusks to shatter solid ice floes as it swims, clearing paths for its pack. It is the final form of the Spheal line. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its imposing bulk and herd mentality make it an apex predator in its frozen habitat.
