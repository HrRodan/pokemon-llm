## Identity & Lore
Iron Treads (Pokedex #990) is a Paradox Pokémon of the Ground and Steel types, first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It bears a striking, metallic resemblance to the modern-day Pokémon Donphan, yet it possesses a cold, robotic physiology. Described as a "scientific weapon" by paranormal magazines, lore suggests it may have been sent to Earth by extraterrestrials or originated from a distant future timeline within Area Zero. This gray, quadrupedal machine can curl into a tread-like sphere to move at high speeds, leaving destruction in its wake. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is classified alongside other futuristic "Iron" entities that utilize advanced technology to mimic organic biological functions.

## Evolution & Biology
Iron Treads is a standalone Paradox Pokémon and is not part of a conventional evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. Biologically, it is an anomaly that mirrors the Great Tusk of the past, representing a futuristic divergence of the Donphan lineage. It belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Despite its mechanical nature, it exhibits a "slow" growth rate and is significantly heavier than its organic counterparts, weighing in at 240.0 kg. It is most commonly sighted within the restricted depths of the Great Crater of Paldea.
