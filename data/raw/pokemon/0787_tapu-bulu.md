## Identity & Lore
Tapu Bulu (#787) is the Land Spirit Pokémon and serves as the legendary guardian deity of Ula'ula Island in the Alola region (Generation VII). Adorned with a bell-like shell that it can close around its body, Tapu Bulu is a powerful Grass/Fairy-type entity known for its immense physical strength and its mastery over nature. According to Alolan lore, it can uproot massive trees and swing them around with ease; it causes vegetation to grow instantly and then absorbs energy from that very growth. While it is a benevolent protector, it is also known for a certain degree of indolence and a terrifying temper if provoked. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is capable of channeling its power into the unique Z-Move "Guardian of Alola," calling upon a titan of the earth to strike its foes.

## Evolution & Biology
Tapu Bulu is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It neither evolves from nor into any other species, existing as a standalone guardian. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, as is typical for legendary spirits, and has a slow growth rate. Biologically, its shell functions like a ritual bell, and its heavy, muscular arms are designed for manipulating the landscape of its island home. It is often found in the Ruins of Abundance, where it is venerated by the people of Alola.
