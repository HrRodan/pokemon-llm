## Identity & Lore
Skiploom (Pokédex #188) is the Cottonweed Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Flying creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Distinctive for the yellow bloom atop its green, spherical body, Skiploom functions biologically as a living thermometer; the petals on its head expand and contract in direct response to ambient temperature, opening wide to absorb sunlight when the weather warms. Primarily found in grasslands where it can float on gentle breezes, it seeks to maximize photosynthesis to fuel its eventual metamorphosis. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it serves as the transitional stage between the rooted nature of Hoppip and the free-floating drift of Jumpluff.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 45, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 65, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Support / Disruptor.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Grass/Flying type, it has a significant **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice-type** moves. It is also weak to Fire, Poison, Flying, and Rock. However, it is **immune to Ground-type** attacks (including Spikes) and possesses a double resistance (0.25x) to Grass, alongside resistances to Fighting and Water.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its low offensive stats (45 in both Attack and Sp. Atk), Skiploom functions best by utilizing its high Speed (80) to inflict status conditions or pivot. An optimal moveset includes **Sleep Powder** (crowd control), **Leech Seed** (passive damage and recovery), **U-turn** (to switch out while dealing chip damage), and **Giga Drain** (STAB damage with health recovery).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Chlorophyll:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during harsh sunlight, making it an incredibly fast disruptor on Sun teams.
    *   **Leaf Guard:** Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by status conditions during harsh sunlight.
    *   **Infiltrator (Hidden Ability):** Allowing its moves to bypass the foe's Reflect, Light Screen, Aurora Veil, and Substitute, ensuring status moves like Sleep Powder land successfully.
