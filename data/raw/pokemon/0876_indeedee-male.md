## Identity & Lore
Indeedee (Male) (#876) is the Emotion Pokémon, a unique dual-type Normal and Psychic species first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. Standing at 0.9 meters, this bipedal, purple-and-white Pokémon is characterized by its horn-like sensors which it uses to detect the emotional states of living beings. While the female counterpart of the species takes on a nurturing, maternal role, the male Indeedee acts as a diligent valet, anticipating the needs of those it serves and providing unwavering support. It is known for its polite demeanor and its tendency to draw energy from positive emotions like gratitude and joy. Though it currently possesses no known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, the male Indeedee is distinguished from its female counterpart by its more aggressive base stats and a specific movepool geared toward offensive pressure rather than pure defense.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 65, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 95, Speed 95.
* **Archetype:** Offensive Support / Special Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug and Dark**. Due to its Normal/Psychic typing, it possesses a unique **Immunity to Ghost** and naturally resists **Psychic** moves. Its Psychic typing also neutralizes the standard Normal-type weakness to Fighting, making that matchup neutral.
* **Move Selection:** Male Indeedee excels as a special attacker, particularly when utilizing terrain-based strategies. Key moves include **Expanding Force** (which doubles in power and hits multiple targets under Psychic Terrain), **Hyper Voice** (strong STAB spread damage), **Mystical Fire** (crucial coverage for Steel and Ice types), and **Psychic-Noise** (to prevent opponent healing). It also has access to **Fake Out** and **Helping Hand** for high-level double-battle utility.
* **Abilities:** **Psychic Surge** (Hidden Ability) is its most competitive trait, automatically setting Psychic Terrain to boost Psychic moves and protect grounded allies from priority attacks. **Inner Focus** prevents the Pokémon from flinching, while **Synchronize** passes status conditions like Burn or Poison back to the attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Indeedee is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is a gender-dimorphic species where the male and female forms feature different base stats and movepool access; the male variant specifically prioritizes Special Attack and Speed over the female’s defensive focus. It belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 40, indicating a moderate breeding cycle. Biologically, it is highly social and thrives in domestic environments where it can serve as a loyal companion, utilizing its "Fast" growth rate to quickly reach its full combat potential.
