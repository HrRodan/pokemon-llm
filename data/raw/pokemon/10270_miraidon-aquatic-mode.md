## Identity & Lore
Miraidon Aquatic Mode (Pokedex #10270) is the Paradox Pokémon, a legendary robotic entity introduced in the Paldea region (Generation IX). Known by the cryptic moniker "Iron Serpent," this blue, sleek creature is believed to be a futuristic descendant of the contemporary Cyclizar. While it shares a similar biological silhouette with its modern-day relative, Miraidon is far more ruthless and possesses overwhelming technological power. The "Aquatic Mode" is a specialized configuration used by Miraidon to navigate across oceans and rivers, utilizing its jet-propulsion-like features to glide across the water's surface with incredible efficiency. As the primary mascot of *Pokémon Violet*, it represents the pinnacle of future evolution, residing deep within the Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero).

## Evolution & Biology
Miraidon is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is considered a Paradox counterpart to Cyclizar, though the two share no direct evolutionary link in current biological terms. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Despite its mechanical appearance, Miraidon displays complex behaviors, ranging from a cautious, observant nature to a fierce combat instinct. Its biology is a fusion of organic-like scales and futuristic energy-conducting materials, allowing it to shift between various "Drive" modes for traversal and combat.
