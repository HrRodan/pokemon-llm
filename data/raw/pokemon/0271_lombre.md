## Identity & Lore
Lombre (Pokédex #271) is the Water/Grass-type Jolly Pokémon introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Resembling a kappa from Japanese folklore, this green, humanoid creature possesses a body covered in a slippery, mucous film. It is primarily nocturnal, spending its days sleeping on beds of water grass and becoming active at night to hunt or engage in mischievous behavior. Lombre inhabits the **water's edge** in sunny areas, blending in with aquatic vegetation. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it acts as the middle stage for the fully evolved Ludicolo.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 50, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 70, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Defensive Pivot / Rain Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual Water/Grass type, it possesses a unique defensive profile. It is **weak to Flying, Poison, and Bug** types. It **resists Water, Ground, and Steel** attacks. Notably, its dual typing neutralizes the standard Grass weaknesses to Fire and Ice.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its slightly higher Special Attack and support capabilities, optimal moves include **Scald** (for burn utility), **Giga Drain** (for longevity), **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Flying types), and **Fake Out** (for immediate priority flinching).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during heavy rain.
    *   **Rain Dish:** Restores 1/16th of its maximum HP at the end of every turn while it is raining.
    *   **Own Tempo (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused and blocks the effect of the Intimidate ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Lombre is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Lotad** starting at **Level 14**. To reach its final form, **Ludicolo**, Lombre must be exposed to a **Water Stone**. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Plant** Egg Groups, often requiring a Hatch Counter of 15 cycles. Wild Lombre may occasionally be found holding a Mental Herb.
