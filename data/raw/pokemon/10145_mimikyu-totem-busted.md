## Identity & Lore
Mimikyu-Totem-Busted (Pokedex #10145) is the Disguise Pokémon, a Ghost/Fairy-type variant specifically encountered during the Island Challenge in the Alola region (Generation VII). This particular form represents the "Busted" state of a Totem Mimikyu—a larger, more powerful version of the species that has already had its defensive disguise breached by an attacker. Mimikyu is a lonely Pokémon that hides its terrifying, eldritch true form beneath a hand-drawn rag designed to look like a Pikachu, hoping the popularity of the mascot will help it make friends. Its lore is steeped in mystery and dread; scholars who have dared to look beneath its shroud are said to have perished from the sheer terror of the sight. While Mimikyu does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique status as a Totem Pokémon in Alola grants it a special aura that boosts its stats during trial battles in the Thrifty Megamart.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 90, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 105, Speed 96.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper / Revenge Killer.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ghost and Steel**. It highly **resists Bug (1/4x)** and is completely **immune to Normal, Fighting, and Dragon** types, giving it incredible defensive utility despite its low HP.
* **Move Selection:** Mimikyu-Totem-Busted excels at physical wall-breaking and priority finishing. Key moves include **Play Rough** (its strongest STAB Fairy attack), **Shadow Claw** (consistent Ghost-type damage), **Shadow Sneak** (essential priority for picking off weakened foes), and **Swords Dance** (leveraging its ability to double its Attack power).
* **Abilities:** Disguise (In this Busted form, the ability has already been triggered. Originally, it allows the Pokémon to escape damage from one hit. When the disguise is broken, the Pokémon's head drops, and it transitions into this Busted state, losing a small portion of its maximum HP in the process).

## Evolution & Biology
Mimikyu-Totem-Busted is part of a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve into or from any other Pokémon. It is a unique biological entity within the **Indeterminate** Egg Group. In its natural habitat, typically dark or abandoned locations like the Thrifty Megamart in Alola, it spends its life carefully maintaining its rag. If the "neck" of the costume is broken during combat, Mimikyu will spend the entire night frantically repairing it. Because it is a Totem variant, it is significantly heavier (2.8kg) and taller (0.4m) than a standard Mimikyu, though it retains the same "squiggle" shape and yellowish hue. It has a medium growth rate and is known for being extremely difficult to capture, possessing a capture rate of 45.
