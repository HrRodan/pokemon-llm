## Identity & Lore
Swadloon (Pokedex #541) is the Leaf-Wrapped Pokémon, a reclusive Bug/Grass-type species first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Emerging from its initial stage as a Sewaddle, Swadloon wraps itself in a thick cloak of leaves to conserve energy and protect itself from the cold while it prepares for its final metamorphosis. Preferring the damp, shaded forest floor, Swadloon is known for its grumpy or stoic facial expression, though its ecological role is purely benevolent; it converts fallen leaves into rich nutrients that nourish the surrounding plant life, ensuring the forest's foliage remains lush and superb. While it does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, its final evolution, Leavanny, is celebrated as a nurturing "parent" of the forest.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 63, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 80, Speed 42.
* **Archetype:** Eviolite Physical Tank / Entry Hazard Setter.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire and Flying**. It is also **weak to Rock, Poison, Bug, and Ice**. Conversely, it highly **resists Grass (0.25x)** and provides resistances to **Fighting, Ground, Water, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its modest offensive stats, Swadloon utilizes its physical pool and utility to influence the battlefield. Key moves include **Seed Bomb** for physical STAB damage, **Lunge** to lower the opponent's Attack, **Sticky Web** to provide invaluable speed control for the team, and **Iron Defense** to further bolster its impressive base 90 Defense.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Leaf Guard:** Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by non-volatile status conditions (like burn or paralysis) during harsh sunlight.
    * **Chlorophyll:** Boosts the Pokémon's Speed stat in harsh sunlight, potentially overcoming its naturally low base Speed.
    * **Overcoat (Hidden Ability):** Grants immunity to damage from weather effects like Sandstorm and Hail, as well as immunity to "Powder" moves (such as Spore or Sleep Powder), making it a reliable switch-in against certain utility threats.

## Evolution & Biology
Swadloon is the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sewaddle** starting at Level 20. To reach its final form, **Leavanny**, Swadloon must be leveled up while maintaining a high level of **Friendship (220 or higher)**, reflecting the lore that it matures through the care and bond of its trainer or community. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15. In the wild, specimens are occasionally found carrying a **Mental Herb**, which allows them to snap out of infatuation or taunt-induced mental blocks, reflecting their focused and guarded nature.
