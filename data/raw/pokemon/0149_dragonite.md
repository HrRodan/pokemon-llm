## Identity & Lore
Dragonite (Pokedex #149) is the Dragon Pokémon and the original Pseudo-Legendary introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its kindhearted nature, this intelligent marine creature is said to possess an intellect matching that of humans and is often spotted saving drowning sailors near the water's edge. Despite its bulky, orange, upright physique, Dragonite is an exceptionally fast flier, capable of circling the globe in just 16 hours. It acts as the benevolent guardian of the sea, though it will rampage uncontrollably if its environment is threatened.

## Evolution & Biology
