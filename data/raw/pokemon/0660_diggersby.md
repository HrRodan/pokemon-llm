## Identity & Lore
Diggersby (Pokedex #660) is the Digging Pokémon, first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. This brawny, brown-furred creature is easily identified by its massive, muscular ears which function as a secondary pair of powerful arms. According to its lore, Diggersby is a staple at construction sites because it can heft boulders weighing over a ton with ease using these ears. When it finishes a hard day's work, it is known to lounge around in its burrow, which it digs with the efficiency of an excavator. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its unique physiology and blue-collar worker aesthetic make it one of the most distinctive Normal/Ground-types in the Pokémon world.

It also has access to **Fire Punch** and **Ice Punch** for critical elemental coverage.

    * **Pickup:** Allows the Pokémon to occasionally find items outside of battle or during a turn in battle if an opponent consumes a held item. 
    * **Cheek Pouch:** Restores additional HP when the Pokémon consumes a Berry. 
    * **Huge Power (Hidden Ability):** Doubts the Pokémon's Attack stat in battle, transforming Diggersby from a mediocre scout into a terrifying offensive threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Diggersby is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bunnelby** starting at **Level 20**. Biologically, Diggersby is a hardy survivor that uses its fur to stay warm and its ears to defend its territory. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** egg group, and its eggs have a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively quick to breed for competitive play. Its dual Normal/Ground typing is rare, providing it with a unique niche in the competitive ecosystem as an Electric-type check that can hit back with devastating force.
