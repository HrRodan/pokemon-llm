## Identity & Lore
Gorebyss (Pokédex #368) is known as the South Sea Pokémon, a distinct aquatic species introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing in the extreme depths of the southern seas, this pink, serpentine Pokémon possesses a body structure specifically evolved to withstand enormous water pressure, rendering it largely unharmed by ordinary physical attacks. While its appearance is elegant and colorful, Gorebyss is known for its deceptively cruel feeding habits; it uses its thin, pointed mouth to siphon body fluids from prey. Although it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is a notable member of the Hoenn marine ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 84, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 114, Sp. Def 75, Speed 52.
*   **Archetype:** Setup Sweeper / Baton Pass Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water-type**, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** attacks. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Special Attack and access to arguably the best setup move in the game, its optimal move set includes **Shell Smash** (to sharply raise offensive stats and speed), **Hydro Pump** (for high-power STAB), **Ice Beam** (to cover Grass weakness), and **Psychic** or **Shadow Ball** (for coverage). Alternatively, it often runs **Baton Pass** to transfer its boosted stats to a teammate.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat when it is raining, transforming Gorebyss into a fast threat despite its low base speed.
    *   **Hydration (Hidden):** Cures the Pokémon's status conditions at the end of each turn if it is raining.

## Evolution & Biology
Gorebyss is one of two final forms in a split 2-stage evolutionary line starting with Clamperl. It evolves from **Clamperl** via a specific trade method: the trainer must trade Clamperl while it is holding a **Deep Sea Scale**. If Clamperl is traded holding a Deep Sea Tooth instead, it evolves into Huntail. Gorebyss belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and has a slow-then-very-fast growth rate. Wild Gorebyss can occasionally be found holding a Deep Sea Scale, reflecting the item required for its own evolution.
