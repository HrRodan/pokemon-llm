## Identity & Lore
Ferrothorn (Pokedex #598) is the Thorn Pod Pokémon, a formidable Grass and Steel-type first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This gray, metallic organism is characterized by its durasteel-like shell and three powerful, vine-like appendages tipped with sharp spikes. According to ecological records, Ferrothorn frequently clings to the ceilings of caves, raining down steel spikes on unsuspecting prey or swinging its feelers with enough force to reduce massive boulders to rubble. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, Ferrothorn has maintained a reputation as one of the most oppressive defensive forces in competitive history due to its unique typing and punishing physical presence.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 74, Attack 94, Defense 131, Sp. Atk 54, Sp. Def 116, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Hazard-Setting Physical Tank. Its immense defensive profile and abysmal speed make it a premier "Wall" that punishes attackers simply for making contact.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire** and a weakness to **Fighting**. However, it boasts an incredible list of resistances, including **Normal, Water, Electric, Psychic, Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy**, a **quad-resistance (1/4x) to Grass**, and a total **immunity to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Ferrothorn excels by using its low speed and high physical bulk to its advantage. Key moves include:
    * **Gyro Ball:** A Steel-type STAB move that deals devastating damage because of Ferrothorn's naturally low Speed.
    * **Power Whip:** A high-power Physical Grass-type move that utilizes its respectable 94 Attack stat.
    * **Stealth Rock:** An essential entry hazard used to damage opposing Pokémon upon switching in.
    * **Spikes:** A stackable hazard that further punishes grounded opponents, cementing Ferrothorn's role as a utility lead.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Iron Barbs:** Its primary tactical asset; any opponent that hits Ferrothorn with a contact move takes damage equal to 1/8th of their maximum HP.
    * **Anticipation (Hidden Ability):** Allows Ferrothorn to sense if an opponent possesses a move that is super-effective or a one-hit KO move like Fissure.

## Evolution & Biology
Ferrothorn is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Ferroseed** once it reaches **Level 40**. Biologically, it is a sturdy hybrid of organic plant matter and reinforced minerals, reflecting its placement in both the **Plant** and **Mineral** Egg Groups. It often carries the **Sticky Barb** item in the wild, which can transfer to and damage foes. Trainers breeding Ferrothorn should note its Hatch Counter of 20, requiring significant travel to produce offspring. Its biology allows it to survive in harsh cave environments where it can anchor itself to stone surfaces using its three spiked tentacles to remain stationary for long periods.
