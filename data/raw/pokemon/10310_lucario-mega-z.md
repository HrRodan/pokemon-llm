## Identity & Lore
Lucario-Mega-Z (Pokedex #10310) is the Mega-Z evolution of the Aura Pokémon, Lucario. Originally discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), this specific form represents a radical peak of its aura-sensing capabilities. Standing 1.3 meters tall with a sleek, upright blue physique, Lucario-Mega-Z is a dual Fighting and Steel-type Pokémon capable of reading the thoughts and movements of others by sensing the aura they emit. According to legend, it can understand human speech and can track auras over distances of half a mile. While standard Lucario are known for their balanced offensive presence, this "Mega-Z" variant is an extreme specialized form, potentially linked to high-intensity Mega Evolution energy or the unique "Z" phenomenon. It remains a rare sight in competitive circuits, often overshadowing its base form and standard Mega Evolution through its sheer velocity and concentrated spiritual power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 100, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 164, Sp. Def 70, Speed 151.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a staggering Base Speed of 151 and a massive Special Attack of 164, Lucario-Mega-Z is designed to outspeed almost the entire unboosted metagame and deliver devastating special strikes.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Ground, and Fighting**. Despite these vulnerabilities, its Steel typing grants it a vital **Immunity to Poison** and resistances to Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Bug, Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Dark types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Aura Sphere** (a never-miss signature Fighting-type move), **Flash Cannon** (for heavy Steel-type STAB damage), **Vacuum Wave** (for high-priority special chip damage), and **Psychic** or **Dragon Pulse** for versatile type coverage.
* **Abilities:** While specific ability data for this variant is specialized, typical members of this species leverage **Adaptability** (to boost STAB moves), **Inner Focus** (to prevent flinching), or **Steadfast**. In this form, it likely utilizes its aura to bypass defensive screens and strike with unerring precision.

## Evolution & Biology
Lucario-Mega-Z is the final evolutionary stage of a two-stage line, preceded by the baby Pokémon **Riolu**. Riolu evolves into Lucario when leveled up with **High Friendship (160+ Happiness)** specifically during the **Daytime**. This Mega-Z state is a temporary transformation achieved in battle through the use of a Lucarionite or specialized Z-energy. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 25. Biologically, its Steel-type composition hardens its fur and limbs into natural armor, while its aura sensors on the back of its head allow it to "see" its surroundings even with its eyes closed, making it a peerless combatant in low-visibility environments.
