## Identity & Lore
Meowscarada (Pokedex #908) is the Magician Pokémon, a sophisticated bipedal feline representing the final evolutionary stage of the Grass-type starter from the Paldea region (Generation IX). Standing at 1.5 meters, it is distinguished by its dark, mask-like facial markings and a flowing green cape lined with reflective fur. This cape is used to camouflage the stem of its flower, creating a deceptive illusion that the flower is floating in mid-air—a hallmark of its theatrical and misdirection-based behavior. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Meowscarada is a primary candidate for the Terastal phenomenon found in Paldea, often utilizing the Tera-Grass or Tera-Stellar types to augment its offensive capabilities. Known for its prideful and sometimes jealous nature, it is fiercely attached to its trainer and often performs elaborate tricks with pollen-filled flower bombs.

## Evolution & Biology
Meowscarada is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as the Grass Cat Pokémon, **Sprigatito**, which evolves into **Floragato** starting at Level 16. The transition to its final form, **Meowscarada**, occurs once it reaches Level 36. Biologically, it is a highly agile hunter that belongs to the **Ground and Plant** Egg Groups, with a medium-slow growth rate. Despite its elegant appearance, it is a formidable physical combatant that uses its "magician" theme to distract opponents before striking with high-velocity flower bombs.
