## Identity & Lore
Stonjourner (Pokedex #874) is the Big Rock Pokémon, a massive, sentient lithic organism first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Standing at 2.5 meters and weighing over 500 kilograms, its body is composed of various stone blocks that resemble the megaliths of Stonehenge. Stonjourner is most commonly found in vast, open grasslands where it spends the majority of its time in a stationary, meditative state, observing the sun’s trajectory from dawn until dusk. Once a year, these Pokémon gather from all directions to form perfect circles, a behavioral mystery that has led researchers to believe they possess an innate connection to celestial cycles or ancient ley lines. While it appears slow and stiff, it is surprisingly agile with its lower body, possessing a natural talent for delivering devastating, dynamic kicks. While it currently lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique physiology makes it a focal point of Galarian geological folklore.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 125, Defense 135, Sp. Atk 20, Sp. Def 20, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Doubles Support.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Rock-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Grass**. It possesses natural **resistances to Normal, Flying, Poison, and Fire**.
* **Move Selection:** Stonjourner is defined by extreme stat polarization, with massive Physical prowess and virtually non-existent Special capabilities. Capitalizing on its high Attack and Defense, key moves include **Stone Edge** for high-crit STAB damage, **Earthquake** for wide-range coverage, **Body Press** to utilize its massive 135 Defense stat for offense, and **Heat Crash**, which takes advantage of its 520kg weight to punish Grass and Steel types.
* **Abilities:** Power Spot (Stonjourner’s signature ability). While Stonjourner is on the field, the power of moves used by its allies is increased by 30%. This makes it a premier support choice in multi-battle formats, acting as a living totem that amplifies its team's damage output.

## Evolution & Biology
Stonjourner is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. Biologically, it is a member of the **Mineral** egg group, sharing traits with other inorganic lifeforms. Despite its rocky exterior, it is capable of complex movement, though it prefers to remain still to conserve energy. Its "legs" are actually thick pillars of stone that can extend and contract, allowing it to traverse the rugged terrain of the Galar Route 10 or the Lake of Outrage. Breeding requires a hatch counter of approximately 25 cycles, and it is known for a "slow" growth rate, reflecting the enduring and permanent nature of the minerals that compose its body.
