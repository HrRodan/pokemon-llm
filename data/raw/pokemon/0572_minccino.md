## Identity & Lore
Minccino (Pokedex #572) is the Chinchilla Pokémon, a charming and meticulously clean creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its soft gray fur and large ears, Minccino is best known for its obsession with hygiene; it uses its long, broom-like tail to sweep and dust its surroundings and greets others of its kind by rubbing tails together in a grooming ritual. In its natural habitat, if it finds an object that is dirty, it will spend hours cleaning it until it is spotless. While Minccino does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, its evolved form, Cinccino, is renowned in competitive circles for its multi-hit capabilities.
