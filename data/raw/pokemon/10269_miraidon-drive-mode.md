## Identity & Lore
Miraidon (Pokedex #10269) is the Paradox Pokémon, a legendary entity from the distant future first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. In its sleek, mechanical Drive Mode, Miraidon utilizes its jet-engine-like appendages to traverse the land and sea with unparalleled efficiency. While it bears a striking physical resemblance to the modern-day Cyclizar, the flavor text reveals it is a far more ruthless and powerful "Iron Serpent" that arrived via the Time Machine at the bottom of Area Zero. This futuristic counterpart is the mascot of Pokémon Violet, serving as both a high-tech mount and a formidable combatant. Unlike its ancestors, Miraidon's biology is infused with bio-mechanical energy, and it represents the pinnacle of Paradox evolution. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its "Ultimate Mode" is its primary combat state, allowing it to channel massive amounts of electricity.

## Evolution & Biology
Miraidon is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of a traditional evolutionary line. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, it is categorized as a Paradox relative of **Cyclizar**, appearing to be a version of that Pokémon from thousands of years in the future. Despite its robotic appearance, it has organic needs and a high base happiness potential, though its capture rate is exceptionally low at 3. It grows at a **Slow** rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. While it does not evolve, it can shift between several functional modes, including its Drive Mode for transport and its Ultimate Mode for battle.
