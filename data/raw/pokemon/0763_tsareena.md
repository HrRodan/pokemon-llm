## Identity & Lore
Tsareena (#763) is the Fruit Pokémon, a regal and formidable Grass-type originally discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. Known for its striking, humanoid appearance and long, powerful legs, Tsareena exudes an air of nobility and dominance. This Pokémon is the result of a Steenee that has gained the strength and confidence to protect its kind; only the most talented kickers among Steenee are able to evolve into this "queenly" form. Its sepals function like a crown, and its flavor text highlights a ruthless streak: it uses its legs to execute masterful kicks and will boisterously laugh while stepping on defeated opponents. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, Tsareena is feared in the wild for its aggressive nature and its role as a protector of Bounsweet.

## Evolution & Biology
Tsareena is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The journey begins with **Bounsweet**, which evolves into **Steenee** starting at Level 18. The final transformation into Tsareena is unique; Steenee must **level up while knowing the move Stomp** to trigger the evolution, symbolizing its mastery of leg-based combat. Biologically, Tsareena belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group. It is a high-maintenance Pokémon that demands a trainer with the resolve to match its assertive personality. In the ecosystem, its fragrance is much more refined than its predecessors, and it uses its hardy physique to drive away bird Pokémon that target its younger evolutionary forms.
