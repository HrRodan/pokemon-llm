## Identity & Lore
Greedent (Pokedex #820) is the Greedy Pokémon, a stocky and resilient Normal-type introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). This brown, squirrel-like creature is defined by its insatiable appetite and its massive, bushy tail, which serves as a mobile storage unit for berries. It stashes so many snacks in its tail that they constantly tumble out as it moves; however, Greedent is notoriously slow-witted and rarely notices its trail of lost food. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a common sight near Berry Trees across the Galar region, often surprising trainers who shake the branches too vigorously.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 120, Attack 95, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 75, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Berry Sweeper. 
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a natural **immunity to Ghost**. It has no other resistances.
* **Move Selection:** Greedent excels at using its bulk and signature berry-related mechanics to outlast opponents. Key moves include **Body Slam** for STAB and paralysis chance, **Stuff Cheeks** to consume a held berry while doubling Defense, **Body Press** to capitalize on its high Defense for damage, and **Earthquake** or **Seed Bomb** for essential coverage against Steel or Rock types.
* **Abilities:** **Cheek Pouch** (Restores 1/3 of max HP when a berry is consumed, in addition to the berry's effect) and **Gluttony** (Makes the Pokémon use its held berry at 50% HP instead of 25%, allowing for early-game stat boosts or healing).

## Evolution & Biology
Greedent is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Skwovet** starting at **Level 24**. Biologically, Greedent is an upright-standing mammal with a tough hide and a thick layer of fat that contributes to its impressive 120 Base HP. It belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group and is known to be particularly hardy, often enduring several hits while it methodically finishes its meal. Its "slow-witted" nature is reflected in its incredibly low Speed stat, making it a premier candidate for **Trick Room** competitive teams where its low speed allows it to move first.
