## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Sneasel (Pokedex #10235) is the Sharp Claw Pokémon, a regional variant adapted to the rugged, mountainous terrain of the ancient Hisui region (historically known as Sinnoh). While its Johto counterpart is a Dark/Ice type, this Hisuian form has developed a unique Poison/Fighting physiology. Standing 0.9 meters tall with a sleek, dark-colored body, it possesses specialized claws designed for scaling sheer cliffs. These claws are more than just climbing tools; as noted in historical records, they conceal a potent venom. If provoked, Hisuian Sneasel can suddenly extend these talons to startle and incapacitate enemies with a single strike. Although this specific form does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the only variant capable of evolving into the formidable Sneasler, a Pokémon renowned for its unparalleled climbing ability and lethality in the Highlands.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Sneasel is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. In the Hisui region, it diverges from the standard Sneasel lineage; it evolves into **Sneasler** when it is leveled up during the **Daytime** while holding a **Razor Claw**. This is a direct biological contrast to the Johto form, which requires the same item at Night to evolve into Weavile. Biologically, Hisuian Sneasel belongs to the **Ground** egg group. It is characterized by its "upright" shape and a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its poisonous nature, its habitat is primarily within lush forests and rocky highlands where it can utilize its climbing prowess to evade predators.
