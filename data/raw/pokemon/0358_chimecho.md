## Identity & Lore
Chimecho (Pokédex #358) is the Wind Chime Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This Psychic-type creature possesses a hollow body that resonates with the wind, allowing it to produce beautiful, echoing cries. While usually peaceful, floating on wind currents across grasslands, Chimecho uses this anatomy for defense; when enraged, it emits ultrasonic waves strong enough to knock opponents flying. Its appearance resembles a traditional Japanese Fūrin (wind chime), characterized by its pale blue body and long, tag-like tail.

## Evolution & Biology
Chimecho is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the baby Pokémon **Chingling** when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+) during the Night**. Chimecho belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group. Uniquely, to breed a Chingling, a Chimecho parent must usually hold a **Pure Incense**; otherwise, the egg will produce another Chimecho.
