## Identity & Lore
Metagross (Pokedex #376) is the imposing Iron Leg Pokémon, a pseudo-legendary powerhouse first discovered in the Hoenn region (Generation III). A fusion of two Metang, this robotic entity possesses four distinct brains that are neurologically linked, granting it intelligence superior to a supercomputer and the ability to analyze complex battle strategies instantly. Its massive, teal-colored metallic body is usually anchored to rough terrain, but it can levitate by tucking in its four legs to fly at high speeds. Metagross is a ruthless predator; it pins its prey to the ground with its massive weight before consuming them. While not listed in its base forms, Metagross is capable of **Mega Evolution** using the Metagrossite, transforming into Mega Metagross and adopting the Tough Claws ability.

## Evolution & Biology
Metagross is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line that exemplifies magnetic fusion. It begins as **Beldum**, which evolves into **Metang** upon reaching **Level 20**. Metang then evolves into **Metagross** starting at **Level 45**. Biologically, this process represents the combination of multiple entities: two Beldum fuse to form a Metang, and two Metang fuse to form a Metagross. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, is genderless, and requires a high hatch counter, reflecting its rarity and power.
