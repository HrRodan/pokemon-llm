## Identity & Lore
Pyukumuku (Pokedex #771) is the Sea Cucumber Pokémon, a specialized aquatic species native to the Alola region of Generation VII. Known for its small, black, "squiggle-shaped" body, Pyukumuku is covered in a thick, slippery slime that serves a dual purpose: it protects its skin from drying out, allowing it to remain on land for days, and it acts as a deterrent to predators. In Alolan lore, Pyukumuku is famous for its stubbornness; once it finds a spot it likes, it will stay there until it starves. This behavior led to the local tradition of "Pyukumuku Chucking," where people earn money by throwing these Pokémon back into the ocean from tourist beaches. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its unique biology—specifically its ability to eject its fist-like internal organs to strike—makes it a distinct and memorable resident of tropical coastlines.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 60, Defense 130, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 130, Speed 5.
* **Archetype:** Passive Defensive Wall / Pure Stall.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It provides valuable **resistances to Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Pyukumuku is unique in that it learns almost no direct attacking moves, relying instead on its massive defenses and utility. Optimal moves to capitalize on its high defensive profile include **Recover** for reliable healing, **Toxic** to inflict status pressure, and the retaliatory pair of **Counter** and **Mirror Coat** to reflect physical and special damage back at attackers using their own power against them.
* **Abilities:** **Innards-Out** is its signature ability, which deals damage to the opponent equal to Pyukumuku's remaining HP upon being knocked out, often securing a revenge kill. Its Hidden Ability, **Unaware**, is elite for competitive stalling, as it allows Pyukumuku to ignore an opponent's Attack, Special Attack, and Evasion stat boosts during damage calculation.

## Evolution & Biology
Pyukumuku is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It belongs to the **Water 1** egg group, and despite its sedentary nature, it has a fast growth rate and a hatch counter of 15. Biologically, Pyukumuku is defined by its extreme lack of mobility, reflected in its base Speed of 5, the lowest among many aquatic species. It compensates for this with specialized support moves such as **Purify**, which heals a target's status condition to restore its own HP, and **Soak**, which can change an opponent's type to pure Water. Its movepool is rounded out by high-level support options like **Baton Pass**, **Memento**, and **Helping Hand**, allowing it to support teammates before exiting the field.
