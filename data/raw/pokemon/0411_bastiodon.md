## Identity & Lore
Bastiodon (Pokedex #411) is the **Shield Pokémon**, a Rock/Steel-type fossil revived from the Armor Fossil in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Renowned for its impenetrable facial hide, its face resembles a fortress wall, allowing it to repel almost any frontal attack. Despite its intimidating, castle-like appearance, Bastiodon is a docile herbivore that feeds primarily on grass and berries. It is the evolutionary counterpart to the offensively oriented Rampardos, representing the ultimate defense. While it does not possess Mega or Gigantamax forms, its distinct facial structure protects its brood from predators by forming a living barricade.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 52, Defense 168, Sp. Atk 47, Sp. Def 138, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Defensive Wall / Hazard Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** The Rock/Steel typing creates extreme polarization. It suffers from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fighting and Ground** moves, and a standard weakness to Water. However, it boasts an **Immunity to Poison** and resistances to Normal (4x), Flying (4x), Rock, Bug, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy types.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its abysmal Attack and Special Attack stats, Bastiodon relies on Utility and Defense-scaling moves:
    *   **Body Press:** The definitive offensive option, utilizing its massive 168 Defense stat to calculate damage rather than its low Attack.
    *   **Metal Burst:** Synergizes with low speed and high bulk to return damage taken from opponents with increased power.
    *   **Stealth Rock:** Exploits its durability to set up crucial entry hazards.
    *   **Iron Defense:** drastically raises Defense, simultaneously making it harder to kill and doubling the power of Body Press.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents being knocked out in one hit if at full HP. This is vital for surviving its 4x weaknesses to Ground and Fighting.
    *   **Soundproof (Hidden):** Grants immunity to sound-based moves (e.g., Hyper Voice, Roar, Bug Buzz).

## Evolution & Biology
Bastiodon is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Shieldon** starting at **Level 30**. In the lore, this evolution is often achieved after reviving a Shieldon from an Armor Fossil. It belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group and has a growth rate that is slow initially but becomes very fast at higher levels.
