## Identity & Lore
Urshifu (Rapid Strike Style) (Pokedex #10191) is the Wushu Pokémon, a formidable Legendary martial artist first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII) on the Isle of Armor. Unlike its counterpart, the Single Strike Style, this Rapid Strike form specializes in fluid, relentless movements inspired by the flow of a river. It is characterized by its gray, humanoid appearance and its disciplined combat stance. In Galar lore, it is the result of a Kubfu completing the rigorous training within the Tower of Waters. Beyond its standard form, Urshifu possesses a unique **Gigantamax Form**, where it grows to colossal size and gains access to the G-Max move *G-Max Steelsurge* (when using Steel moves) or more famously, *G-Max Rapid Flow*, which ignores all defensive barriers to land devastating Water-type damage.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 130, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 63, Sp. Def 60, Speed 97.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Bulky Sweeper. Its high physical bulk and massive Attack stat make it a primary offensive threat that can take a physical hit and retaliate with overwhelming force.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Psychic, Fairy, Grass, and Electric**. It possesses several key **resistances**, including **Steel, Fire, Water, Ice, Bug, Rock, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Attack power, Urshifu-Rapid-Strike relies on a relentless offensive kit. Key moves include **Surging Strikes** (its signature Water-type move that strikes three times and always results in a critical hit), **Close Combat** (a high-power Fighting STAB), **Aqua Jet** (essential priority to pick off weakened targets), and **U-turn** (providing crucial pivot momentum).
* **Abilities:** **Unseen Fist** (The Pokémon's contact moves can hit through the opponent's protection moves like Protect, Detect, or Spiky Shield, making it nearly impossible to stall out).

## Evolution & Biology
Urshifu-Rapid-Strike is the final stage of a two-stage legendary evolutionary line. It evolves from **Kubfu** after the trainer completes the challenge of the **Tower of Waters** and shows the "Scroll of Waters" to Kubfu. This specific training path permanently determines its Fighting/Water typing and Rapid Strike combat style. Biologically, Urshifu is a rare and reclusive Pokémon that lives in remote mountainous areas. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its "Slow" growth rate, its battle-hardened physique and mastery of the "Rapid Strike" technique allow it to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of strikes that mimic a torrential downpour.
