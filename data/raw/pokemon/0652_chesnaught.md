## Identity & Lore
Chesnaught (Pokedex #652) is the Spiny Armor Pokémon, a stalwart bipedal warrior that serves as the final evolution of the Grass-type starter from the Kalos region (Generation VI). Enveloped in a nearly impenetrable, thorny shell, this Pokémon is renowned for its immense physical strength and protective instincts; its Tackle is reportedly forceful enough to flip a 50-ton tank, yet it uses this power primarily to shield its allies from harm. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Chesnaught is unique for its mastery of defensive combat, often tucking its body into a resilient posture that converts its defensive shell into a weapon.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Overgrow:** Standard starter ability that boosts the power of Grass-type moves by 50% when Chesnaught's HP falls below one-third.
    * **Bulletproof (Hidden Ability):** A highly competitive ability that grants total immunity to "ball" and "bomb" moves, such as Shadow Ball, Sludge Bomb, and Focus Blast, effectively neutralizing many common special-attacking threats.

## Evolution & Biology
Chesnaught is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Chespin**, which evolves into **Quilladin** starting at Level 16. The transition to its final form, **Chesnaught**, occurs upon reaching Level 36. Biologically, Chesnaught is an "upright" mammalian Pokémon characterized by its green and cream-colored armor. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and is often found in temperate environments where it can act as a guardian for smaller Pokémon. Despite its slow movement, its defensive capabilities and the ability to learn high-utility moves like Leech Seed and Spikes make it a formidable presence in long-duration battles.
