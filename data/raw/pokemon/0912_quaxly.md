## Identity & Lore
Quaxly (Pokedex #912) is the Duckling Pokémon, a serious and tidy avian species that serves as the Water-type starter for Trainers beginning their journey in the Paldea region (Generation IX). Originally migrating to Paldea from distant lands long ago, Quaxly is most distinguished by its shimmering white plumage and the decorative coif on its head. Biology suggests its feathers secrete a specialized rich, moist gel that repels both water and grime, allowing it to stay impeccably clean even in muddy environments. This obsession with cleanliness translates to a sincere but headstrong personality. While Quaxly does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Quaquaval, is renowned for its rhythmic, dance-like combat style and its potential as a powerful Tera Type user in competitive circuits.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 65, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 45, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Physical Early-Game Sweeper. While its base stats are modest as a first-stage starter, its Attack is its highest offensive asset, allowing it to hit harder than many other unevolved Water types.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, Quaxly is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical Attack stat and high-crit or high-power options, key moves include **Aqua Cutter**, **Liquidation**, **Brave Bird**, and the priority-striking **Aqua Jet**. For utility and setup, it can utilize **Work Up** or **Rapid Spin** to clear hazards while boosting its speed.
* **Abilities:** **Torrent** (Standard) increases the power of Water-type moves by 50% when Quaxly’s HP falls below a third of its maximum. **Moxie** (Hidden) is highly valued in competitive play, as it raises Quaxly’s Attack stat by one stage every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to "snowball" through an enemy team.

## Evolution & Biology
Quaxly is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Quaxwell** starting at **Level 16**, where it begins to develop more muscular legs for rhythmic kicking. The line culminates in **Quaquaval** starting at **Level 36**, gaining the secondary Fighting type. Quaxly belongs to the **Flying and Water 1** Egg Groups, making it compatible for breeding with a wide variety of waterfowl and aquatic Pokémon. It has a hatch counter of 20, reflecting the standard incubation period for starter species, and follows a medium-slow growth rate, requiring consistent training to reach its full potential as a festive combatant.
