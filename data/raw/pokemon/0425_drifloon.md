## Identity & Lore
Drifloon (Pokedex #425) is the Balloon Pokémon, a Ghost/Flying-type entity first introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Formed by the spirits of people and Pokémon, this purple, spherical creature drifts aimlessly in the wind. According to Pokédex lore, it loves damp, humid seasons and is infamously known to attempt to grab the hands of children to drag them away to the afterlife, though it is often too light to succeed and ends up being pulled around instead. It commonly inhabits areas near windworks or open fields where the breeze can carry it.
