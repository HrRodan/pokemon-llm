## Identity & Lore
Fennekin (Pokedex #653) is the Fox Pokémon, recognized as the Fire-type starter of the Kalos region (Generation VI). This small, quadrupedal Pokémon is distinguished by its large, prominent ears filled with tufts of fur; these ears serve a biological purpose as vents, releasing searing air hotter than 390 degrees Fahrenheit to intimidate adversaries. A temperamental eater, Fennekin prefers snacking on twigs over traditional food, as chewing on wood fills it with the energy required to produce flames. While Fennekin does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form of its own, it eventually matures into the powerful Fire/Psychic-type Delphox, a Pokémon often associated with mystical and wizard-like lore.

## Evolution & Biology
Fennekin is the base form of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the bipedal **Braixen** upon reaching Level 16, and reaches its final maturity as **Delphox** at Level 36, at which point it gains the secondary Psychic typing. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, making it compatible with a vast range of land-based mammals for breeding. Its growth rate is classified as medium-slow, and with a hatch counter of 20, it requires significant care and travel before hatching from an egg.
