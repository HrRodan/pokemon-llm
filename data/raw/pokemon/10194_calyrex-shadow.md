## Identity & Lore
Calyrex Shadow Rider (Pokedex #10194) is the King Pokémon, representing the legendary union between the sovereign Calyrex and the swift, spectral steed Spectrier. Originating in the Galar region’s Crown Tundra (Generation VIII), this Pokémon is a figure of ancient myth, once reigning over the land in times of yore as a merciful monarch capable of providing blessings and healing. While Calyrex itself is a green-colored, humanoid-like creature, this Shadow Rider form manifests when Calyrex uses the **Reins of Unity** to bond with Spectrier, enhancing its psychic powers with overwhelming ghostly energy. It is a legendary entity that can see into the past and future, and it is said to have once moved a massive forest overnight. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it stands as one of the most powerful "Fusion" forms in existence, mirroring its counterpart, Calyrex Ice Rider.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 85, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 165, Sp. Def 100, Speed 150.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a staggering base Speed of 150 and one of the highest Special Attack stats in the history of the series, Calyrex Shadow Rider is designed to outspeed almost the entire unboosted metagame and deliver devastating one-hit knockouts.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **doubly weak (4x) to Ghost and Dark**. It **resists Poison and Psychic** and possesses total **immunities to Normal and Fighting** moves due to its Ghost typing.
* **Move Selection:** Exploiting its massive Special Attack, its premier arsenal includes **Astral Barrage** (a signature 120-BP spread move), **Psyshock** (to bypass special walls like Blissey), **Nasty Plot** (to reach unstoppable offensive levels), and **Pollen Puff** or **Energy Ball** for crucial coverage against Dark and Grass types.
* **Abilities:** As One (Spectrier). This unique ability combines the effects of two separate abilities: **Unnerve**, which prevents opponents from eating their held Berries, and **Grim Neigh**, which boosts Calyrex’s Special Attack by one stage every time it knocks out a Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Calyrex Shadow Rider is a unique legendary form and does not belong to a traditional multi-stage evolutionary line. It is obtained only through the use of the **Reins of Unity** key item, which fuses a Calyrex and a Spectrier into a single unit. This process can be reversed at any time to return the two Pokémon to their base forms. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred, and it has a high Hatch Counter of 120, reflecting its status as a Rare Legendary. Despite its green color classification in the Pokedex, its appearance is dominated by the dark, ethereal purples and blacks of its spectral mount.
