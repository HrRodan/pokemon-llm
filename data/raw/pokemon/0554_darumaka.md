## Identity & Lore
Darumaka (Pokedex #554) is the Zen Charm Pokémon, a quintessential representative of the Unova region first discovered in Generation V. Characterized by its rounded, red, humanoid body, Darumaka is defined by an intense internal fire that fuels its hyperactive behavior. According to Unovan lore, while this fire burns, Darumaka is incapable of remaining still and will restlessly run around; however, when its internal temperature diminishes, the Pokémon enters a deep sleep to conserve energy. Beyond its standard Fire-type form, a regional variant known as **Galarian Darumaka** exists in the Galar region, which adapted to cold climates by becoming a pure Ice-type. While Darumaka itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Darmanitan, is famous for its "Zen Mode" transformation, which drastically alters its biology and combat capabilities.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 90, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 15, Sp. Def 45, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Physical Glass Cannon. In competitive formats like Little Cup, Darumaka functions as a high-risk, high-reward physical wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fire-type, it is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Water**. It maintains valuable **resistances against Bug, Steel, Grass, Ice, and Fire** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 90 Attack stat, Darumaka excels with high-impact physical moves. Key selections include **Flare Blitz** for maximum STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Superpower** or **Hammer Arm** for heavy fighting-type coverage, **Zen Headbutt** to handle Poison and Fighting types, and **Rock Slide** to check flying-type switch-ins.
* **Abilities:** **Hustle** is its primary tactical ability, boosting its Attack stat by 50% at the cost of 20% accuracy, making it one of the hardest-hitting unevolved Pokémon. Its Hidden Ability, **Inner Focus**, provides niche utility by protecting it from flinching and the effects of Intimidate in later generations.

## Evolution & Biology
Darumaka is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. The standard Unovan Darumaka evolves into **Darmanitan** starting at **Level 35**. In contrast, the Galarian variant of Darumaka requires exposure to an **Ice Stone** to trigger its evolution into Galarian Darmanitan. Biologically, Darumaka belongs to the **Ground** egg group. It is often found in arid environments like the Desert Resort in Unova, where it is known to produce droppings that are hot to the touch, which ancient people used to keep themselves warm. Despite its small stature (0.6m), its physical strength is significant, often surprising opponents with its powerful **Mega Punch** and **Thrash** attacks.
