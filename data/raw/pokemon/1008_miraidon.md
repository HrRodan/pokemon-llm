## Identity & Lore
Miraidon (Pokedex #1008) is the Paradox Pokémon, a legendary entity discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is a dual-type Electric and Dragon Pokémon characterized by its metallic, futuristic appearance and sleek blue coloration. While it bears a striking resemblance to the contemporary Pokémon Cyclizar, Miraidon is widely recognized as a "Future Paradox" form—speculated to be a highly advanced descendant of Cyclizar from the distant future. In the ancient texts of Paldea, it is referred to as the "Iron Serpent." Miraidon is unique for its ability to transition between various modular forms to facilitate travel, including Drive Mode, Aquatic Mode, Glide Mode, and its powerful combat-ready **Ultimate Mode**. As a legendary Paradox Pokémon, it is described as far more ruthless and powerful than any modern species, wielding futuristic technology that blurs the line between biology and machinery.

## Evolution & Biology
Miraidon is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not belong to an evolutionary line. It is considered the futuristic counterpart to the prehistoric Koraidon. Biologically, its body is composed of materials that resemble polished metal and glowing energy conduits rather than traditional organic tissue. It is capable of generating massive amounts of electricity within its "Hadron Engine" to power its propulsion and devastating attacks. As a Paradox species, it cannot produce offspring and belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group. It has a slow growth rate, requiring extensive experience to reach its full potential, and has a base happiness of 0, reflecting its cold and ruthless nature.
