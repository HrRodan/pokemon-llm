## Identity & Lore
Anorith (Pokedex #347) is the Old Shrimp Pokémon, a prehistoric specimen originally discovered in Generation III (Hoenn). Regenerated from a fossil—specifically the Root Fossil—using modern science, this primitive Pokémon once flourished in the warm seas of the ancient world. It is characterized by its gray, segmented armor and four pairs of wing-like appendages which it uses to propel itself through water. Anorith is a carnivorous hunter; it stalks the water's edge and utilizes two large, extendable claws to grip its prey firmly before feeding.
