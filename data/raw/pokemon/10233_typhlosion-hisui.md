## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Typhlosion (Pokedex #10233) is the Hisuian Form of the Volcano Pokémon, a unique regional variant first discovered in the ancient Hisui region (Generation VIII). While its Johtonian counterpart is a pure Fire-type, this version has adapted a dual Fire/Ghost typing, often depicted with ethereal, purple-and-pink flames around its neck that are said to purify lost souls and guide them to the afterlife. According to Hisuian records, if its rage peaks, it becomes so hot that anything touching it will instantly go up in flames. This Pokémon is characterized by its yellow fur and a more relaxed, almost meditative posture compared to the aggressive stance of its Johtonian relative. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a regional starter evolution makes it a centerpiece of Hisuian ecology and lore.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Typhlosion is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Cyndaquil**, which evolves into **Quilava** starting at Level 14. In the unique spiritual atmosphere of the Hisui region, Quilava evolves into **Hisuian Typhlosion** at Level 36. Biologically, it is a member of the **Ground** egg group. Despite its ghostly nature, it retains its mammalian "Volcano Pokémon" classification, though its metabolism is now fueled by both physical heat and spiritual energy. It has a hatch counter of 20 and a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its peak combat potential.
