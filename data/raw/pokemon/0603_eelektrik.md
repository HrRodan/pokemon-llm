## Identity & Lore
Eelektrik (#603) is the EleFish Pokémon, a serpentine Electric-type originally discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). This blue, eel-like creature is characterized by the circular, glowing patterns along its body, which are actually sophisticated electricity-generating organs. In the wild, Eelektrik is a relentless predator that coils its 1.2-meter body around its prey, delivering high-voltage shocks while its circular mouth latches on. While Eelektrik itself does not have a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it is part of a unique biological family famous for having no natural type weaknesses due to their specific Ability.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 85, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 70, Speed 40.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Offensive Tank / Eviolite Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Electric-type, it is theoretically **weak to Ground**, but its Ability negates this. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its slightly higher Physical Attack and access to setup moves, Eelektrik excels with **Wild Charge** for heavy STAB damage, **Crunch** for coverage against Ghost and Psychic types, **Coil** to simultaneously boost Attack, Defense, and Accuracy, and **Volt Switch** to maintain positioning and momentum.
* **Abilities:** **Levitate** (Grants full immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, and the Arena Trap ability. This is the cornerstone of its viability, as it removes the Electric type's only natural weakness).

## Evolution & Biology
Eelektrik is the middle stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the small, larval **Tynamo** starting at **Level 39**. To complete its metamorphosis into the formidable **Eelektross**, it must be exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. Biologically, Eelektrik belongs to the **Indeterminate** egg group (often referred to as the Amorphous group). It has a **Hatch Counter of 20**, requiring a moderate amount of travel to hatch from an egg. Despite its aquatic appearance and "EleFish" classification, its ability to float via electromagnetism allows it to thrive in diverse environments far from the water.
