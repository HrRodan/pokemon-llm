## Identity & Lore
Gourgeist-Small (Pokedex #10030) is the Pumpkin Pokémon, a haunting specter first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. This specific Small Size variant is characterized by its diminutive stature and its surprisingly agile movements compared to its larger counterparts. It possesses a distinct, pumpkin-like lower body topped with long, hair-like fronds that function as arms. According to Kalosian folklore, these Pokémon wander town streets on the night of the new moon, singing in eerie, haunting voices; those unfortunate enough to hear their song are said to be cursed. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Gourgeist is unique in the Pokémon world for its size mechanics, where its physical dimensions directly dictate its combat prowess and base stats.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 85, Defense 122, Sp. Atk 58, Sp. Def 75, Speed 99.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Tank / Support. Unlike the Super Size variant which acts as a slow wall, the Small Size Gourgeist functions as a disruptive pivot that uses its high Base 99 Speed to outpace common threats.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Ghost/Grass type, it is **weak to Ghost, Dark, Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It provides valuable defensive utility by **resisting Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric**, and maintains total **immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Physical Attack and Speed, Gourgeist-Small excels with a moveset featuring **Power Whip** for heavy Grass-type damage, **Poltergeist** to punish opponents holding items, **Shadow Sneak** for priority finishing, and **Will-O-Wisp** to cripple physical attackers by inflicting burns.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Pickup:** Allows the Pokémon to occasionally find items outside of battle or retrieve a used item during combat.
    * **Frisk:** Reveals the opponent's held item upon entering battle, providing critical tactical information in competitive play.
    * **Insomnia (Hidden Ability):** Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep, making it a hard counter to "Sleep Powder" or "Spore" users.

## Evolution & Biology
Gourgeist-Small is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pumpkaboo** when the Pokémon is **traded** between trainers. A unique biological trait of this species is that the size of the Pumpkaboo is permanent and carries over through evolution; a Small Size Pumpkaboo will always result in a Small Size Gourgeist. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group, and while it appears plant-like, its biology is deeply tied to spiritual energy. In the wild, its glowing "eyes" are actually holes in its pumpkin body that emit light from the spirit trapped within.
