## Identity & Lore
Wurmple (Pokedex #265) is the Worm Pokémon, a small insectoid creature originally discovered in the **Hoenn region** (Generation III). Primarily found inhabiting forests and tall grass, this red, caterpillar-like Pokémon is characterized by the spikes on its rear end, which it uses to peel bark off trees to feed on the oozing sap. Biologically, Wurmple is equipped with suction pads on the tips of its feet, allowing it to cling to glass surfaces without slipping. As a standard early-route Bug-type, it serves as a primary food source for bird Pokémon like Taillow and Starly. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is unique for its chaotic evolutionary line determined by its internal personality value.

## Evolution & Biology
Wurmple is the first stage of a unique **3-stage evolutionary line** with a divergent path. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group. Its evolution is famously unpredictable for trainers, as it is determined by the Pokémon's hidden personality value (encryption constant), rather than stats or time of day.
*   **Stage 2:** At **Level 7**, Wurmple evolves into either **Silcoon** or **Cascoon**.
*   **Stage 3:**
    *   If it became **Silcoon**, it evolves into **Beautifly** starting at **Level 10**.
    *   If it became **Cascoon**, it evolves into **Dustox** starting at **Level 10**.
