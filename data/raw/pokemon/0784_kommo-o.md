## Identity & Lore
Kommo-o (Pokedex #784) is the Scaly Pokémon, serving as the final evolution of the only Dragon/Fighting-type lineage in the Pokémon world. First discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII, this powerful Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon is covered in glittering, plate-like scales that serve both as sturdy armor and a rhythmic warning system. According to Alolan legend, Kommo-o jingles these scales to intimidate intruders; the mere sound is often enough to send weaker opponents fleeing in a state of panic. It is a creature of deep discipline, often residing in remote canyons like Poni Canyon, where it undergoes rigorous training. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famous for its unique Z-Move, Clangorous Soulblaze, and its signature move, Clanging Scales.

* **Archetype:** Mixed Bulky Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, Flying, and Psychic**, with a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. It provides valuable resistances to **Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Bug, Rock, and Dark**.
* **Move Selection:** Kommo-o excels as a versatile attacker that can pressure opponents from both sides of the spectrum. Key moves include its signature **Clanging Scales** (high-power Special STAB), **Close Combat** (unrivaled Physical Fighting STAB), **Poison Jab** (essential coverage to answer its 4x Fairy weakness), and **Clangorous Soul** (an omni-boost that sacrifices HP for massive stat gains).
* **Abilities:** **Bulletproof** (Protects the Pokémon from some ball and bomb moves like Shadow Ball or Sludge Bomb), **Soundproof** (Provides total immunity to sound-based moves, including the disruptive Roar or opposing Boomburst), and **Overcoat** (The Hidden Ability, which grants immunity to weather-based damage and powder-based moves like Spore).

## Evolution & Biology
Kommo-o is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line characterized by slow growth and late-game power. It begins its life as **Jangmo-o**, which evolves into **Hakamo-o** starting at Level 35. Finally, Hakamo-o evolves into **Kommo-o** upon reaching Level 45. Biologically, its scales are its most vital asset, which it sheds and regrows regularly. It belongs to the **Dragon** Egg Group, and with a Hatch Counter of 40, it requires significant effort from a Trainer to raise from an egg. In battle, it often carries a **Razor Claw** to maximize its critical hit ratio during its aggressive, rhythmic combat dances.
