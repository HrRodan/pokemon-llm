## Identity & Lore
Rockruff (Pokedex #10151) is the Puppy Pokémon, a quadrupel Rock-type creature characterized by its brown fur and friendly, canine-like appearance. While it is first encountered in the Alola region of Generation VII, this specific individual belongs to the rare "Own Tempo" variant, a unique biological subset of the species. Known for its sociable nature, Rockruff is frequently recommended for beginner Trainers due to its loyalty and affectionate behavior. However, as it approaches evolution, its temperament becomes noticeably more aggressive and wild, often howling at the moon and becoming harder to manage. While standard Rockruff can evolve into Midday or Midnight forms of Lycanroc, this specific Own Tempo variant possesses the exclusive genetic potential to evolve into the elusive **Lycanroc Dusk Form**.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 65, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 40, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Physical Early-Game Attacker. With its highest offensive stat being Attack and a respectable Speed tier for a base-form Pokémon, it functions best as a proactive physical hitter.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Rock-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Grass**. It provides defensive **resistances against Normal, Flying, Poison, and Fire** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its physical Attack stat, its optimal moveset includes **Stone Edge** (high-crit STAB), **Crunch** (Dark-type coverage), **Psychic Fangs** (to shatter barriers like Reflect and Light Screen), and **Sucker Punch** (crucial priority to compensate for mid-tier speed).
* **Abilities:** **Own Tempo** (This ability prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused, making it immune to moves like Teeter Dance and the secondary effects of moves like Hurricane or Water Pulse. Tactically, it also allows the use of the move **Thrash** without the drawback of self-confusion).

## Evolution & Biology
Rockruff is the first stage in a two-part evolutionary line. The Own Tempo variant follows a very specific biological trigger: it evolves into **Dusk Form Lycanroc** starting at **Level 25**, but only when leveled up during the **Dusk** timeframe (traditionally between 5:00 PM and 5:59 PM in-game time). This variant cannot evolve into the Midday or Midnight forms available to standard Rockruff. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a hatch cycle of approximately 15 cycles (3,840–4,096 steps). Despite its rocky composition—notably the stones embedded in its neck collar—it behaves remarkably like a domestic puppy, often rubbing these stones against those it trusts as a sign of affection, though the ritual can be quite painful for the Trainer.
