## Identity & Lore
Cherubi (Pokedex #420) is the Cherry Pokémon, a Grass-type entity first recorded in Generation IV within the **Sinnoh** region. This small, pink Pokémon is defined by the secondary, smaller red sphere attached to its stem. This second head is not sentient but serves as a nutrient reservoir; it is packed with the vital energy required for Cherubi's eventual metamorphosis. Biological studies indicate that this nutrient ball is remarkably sweet and tasty, often attracting bird Pokémon as predators. As the nutrients are absorbed, the small ball shrivels, indicating that evolution is imminent. While Cherubi itself does not possess alternate forms, its evolution, Cherrim, is notable for its weather-dependent physiology known as "Flower Gift."

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 35, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 62, Sp. Def 53, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Sun-Reliant Special Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug**. It **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack and reliance on sunny weather, its optimal kit includes **Solar Beam** (for high power without charge in the sun), **Giga Drain** (for sustainability), **Weather Ball** (which becomes a high-power Fire-type move in the sun to counter Steel-types), and **Morning Sun** (which restores more HP in harsh sunlight).
*   **Abilities:** **Chlorophyll** (Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during harsh sunlight). This ability is critical for mitigating Cherubi's naturally low base Speed, transforming it into a viable threat in weather teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Cherubi is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Cherrim** when it reaches **Level 25**. There are no special items or friendship requirements for this evolution; it is purely growth-based. In the wild, specimens are occasionally found holding a **Miracle Seed**, boosting their Grass-type attacks. Cherubi belongs to the **Fairy** and **Plant** Egg Groups.
