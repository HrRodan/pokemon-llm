## Identity & Lore
Nosepass (Pokedex #299) is the Compass Pokémon, a Rock-type entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a moai statue, this gray, humanoid creature resides primarily in caves where it remains largely motionless. Its biology is centered around intense magnetism; its large, red nose functions as a powerful magnet that permanently points north, allowing travelers to use it as a navigational tool. Due to this magnetism, two Nosepass cannot face each other at close range, as their noses will repel one another. While it appears stone-like, it is capable of hunting prey by pulling them in with magnetic force.

## Evolution & Biology
Nosepass is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Probopass** when leveled up in a **special magnetic field** (found in locations like Mt. Coronet, Chargestone Cave, or Vast Poni Canyon) or, in more recent generations, when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and requires approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch. It is famously one of the few Rock-types capable of utilizing Electric-type logic due to its magnetic properties.
