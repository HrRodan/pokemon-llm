## Identity & Lore
Trumbeak (#732) is the Bugle Beak Pokémon, a dual-type Normal and Flying species first introduced in the Alola region during Generation VII. This avian Pokémon is distinguished by its long, colorful beak which possesses remarkable flexibility; by bending the tip of its beak, it can produce a vast array of sounds, often mimicking a bugle to signal others or intimidate rivals. A black-feathered inhabitant of forested areas, Trumbeak is a tactical forager that consumes various berries and stores the leftover seeds within its beak. When it encounters prey or predators, it utilizes its beak as a natural Gatling gun, firing these seeds in rapid-fire bursts. While this evolutionary line—consisting of Pikipek, Trumbeak, and Toucannon—does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, Trumbeak is respected in the Alolan ecosystem for its vocal complexity and defensive seed-firing capabilities.
