## Identity & Lore
Dreepy (Pokedex #885) is the Lingering Pokémon, a dual-type Dragon and Ghost creature first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Originally a prehistoric aquatic species that inhabited ancient seas, Dreepy has been reborn as a ghost, haunting the same areas it once called home millions of years ago. Despite its status as a member of the elite "Pseudo-Legendary" family, Dreepy is physically frail and often so weak that it can be easily bullied or defeated by younger Pokémon. In the wild, it seeks protection from its evolved forms, Drakloak and Dragapult, often being launched like a supersonic missile from the horns of a Dragapult during combat. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution is considered one of the most dominant forces in competitive battling across the Galar and Paldea regions.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 28, Attack 60, Defense 30, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 30, Speed 82.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker (Early Stage). Within its evolutionary tier, Dreepy functions as a high-speed glass cannon, though its primary role is to endure until its high-level evolution.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, Fairy, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses significant **resistances to Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Poison, and Bug**, and is **immune to Normal and Fighting** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its higher Attack and Speed stats, Dreepy utilizes physical and utility-based techniques such as **Sucker Punch** for priority strikes, **Dragon Tail** to force enemy switches, **Bite** for flinching potential, and **Quick Attack** to ensure it strikes first. 
* **Abilities:** **Clear Body** prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats. **Infiltrator** allows it to bypass the effects of Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, and Substitute to hit the opponent directly. Its Hidden Ability, **Cursed Body**, has a 30% chance to disable a move that deals damage to it.

## Evolution & Biology
Dreepy is part of a three-stage evolutionary line characterized by extremely late-game maturation. It evolves into **Drakloak** starting at **Level 50**, which subsequently evolves into the powerful **Dragapult** starting at **Level 60**. Its biology is unique among Dragon-types, appearing as a small, translucent green spirit with a head resembling a prehistoric amphibian. It belongs to the **Dragon** and **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Groups, and due to its slow growth rate, it requires significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its spectral nature, it is known to be a loyal companion that enjoys being treated as a projectile by its evolutionary superiors.
