## Identity & Lore
Paras (Pokedex #046) is the Mushroom Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Grass creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This small, insectoid Pokémon is easily recognized by the two parasitic **tochukaso mushrooms** growing on its back. According to ecological research, these mushrooms are not part of the Pokémon's body but are parasites that burrow into the host to draw nutrients, eventually taking control of the insect's nervous system upon evolution. Paras inhabits damp, dark forests where humidity encourages fungal growth. While generally timid, it can be territorial when protecting the roots it burrows to feed on.

## Evolution & Biology
Paras is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Parasect** when reaching **Level 24**. The evolution represents the total takeover of the host by the parasitic mushrooms, which merge into a single massive fungal growth on its back. Paras belongs to the **Bug** and **Grass** (Plant) Egg Groups.
