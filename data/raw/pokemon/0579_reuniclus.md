## Identity & Lore
Reuniclus (Pokedex #579) is the Multiplying Pokémon, a fascinating organism introduced in Generation V (Unova). Resembling a large green cell or embryo encased in a protective, translucent jelly-like substance, Reuniclus is famous for its immense psychic power generated by its unique physiology. Its flavor text notes that when Reuniclus shake hands, their brains form a powerful neural network, exponentially increasing their telepathic and telekinetic capabilities. While primarily a pure Psychic-type, its design draws inspiration from biological mitosis and the structure of an animal cell. Though it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its presence in competitive play is legendary due to its near-unrivaled utility and bulk.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 65, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 85, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Trick Room Sweeper. With a massive HP pool and abysmal Speed, Reuniclus is a premier candidate for Trick Room teams, turning its slowness into a tactical advantage.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Fighting and Psychic**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Special Attack and sustainability, key moves include **Psychic** (or **Psyshock** for targeting physical defense), **Focus Blast** (to punish Dark and Steel types), **Recover** (for longevity), and **Trick Room** (to control the field’s speed priority). 
* **Abilities:** **Magic Guard** (one of the best abilities in the game, protecting it from indirect damage like Life Orb recoil, Poison, Burn, and entry hazards), **Overcoat** (grants immunity to weather damage and powder-based moves), and its Hidden Ability, **Regenerator** (restores 1/3 of its max HP when switching out).

## Evolution & Biology
Reuniclus is the final form of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Solosis**, which evolves into **Duosion** starting at Level 32. Duosion then evolves into **Reuniclus** upon reaching Level 41. Biologically, this line represents the process of cellular division, with the Pokémon becoming more complex as it matures. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group, and while it lacks a specific habitat in the wild data, it is traditionally found in urban or laboratory settings in the Unova region. It is often found holding a **Persim Berry** to counteract confusion in the wild.
