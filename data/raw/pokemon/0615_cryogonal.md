## Identity & Lore
Cryogonal (Pokedex #615) is the Crystallizing Pokémon, a mysterious and ethereal being that originated in the Unova region during Generation V. Formed from snow and ice crystals, its physical composition is highly reactive to temperature; according to ecological records, when its body temperature rises, it sublimates into steam and vanishes from sight, only to revert to its solid crystalline form when the temperature drops. This blue, hexagonal entity is often found in cold climates like Unova's Twist Mountain. While Cryogonal does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it remains unique for its genderless biology and its ability to produce chains of ice to entrap its prey.

## Evolution & Biology
Cryogonal is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its lack of a gender, it can be bred with a Ditto. Its biological cycle is tied strictly to the climate, functioning as a living snowflake. In competitive environments, it is often seen holding **Never-Melt-Ice** to bolster its freezing offensive capabilities. Its high hatch counter (25) reflects its rare and complex crystalline formation.
