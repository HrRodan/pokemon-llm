## Identity & Lore
Centiskorch (Pokedex #851) is the Radiator Pokémon, a formidable Fire and Bug-type species first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It is easily recognized by its long, flat, centipede-like body which glows with internal heat, reaching temperatures of approximately 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit. Centiskorch is known for its aggressive hunting style, lashing its scorching body like a whip to incinerate prey before launching itself at enemies with devastating force. While not possessing a Mega Evolution, Centiskorch is one of the few Pokémon capable of **Gigantamaxing**. In its Gigantamax form, its body extends to massive lengths, its number of legs increases significantly, and the heat radiating from its belly becomes intense enough to disturb air currents and cause massive thermal storms.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 115, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 90, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Setup Sweeper. Its high base HP and workable Special Defense allow it to survive hits, while its high Attack makes it a major offensive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Ground, and Water**, and it possesses a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**, making it extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock entry hazards. It notably **resists Bug, Steel, Fire, Ice, and Fairy-type attacks**, and it is doubly resistant to Grass.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and signature utility, key moves include **Fire Lash** (which provides STAB and guaranteed Defense drops), **Leech Life** (for Bug-type STAB and vital health recovery), **Power Whip** (crucial Grass-type coverage to hit Water and Rock-type counters), and **Coil** (a premier setup move that boosts Attack, Defense, and Accuracy simultaneously).
* **Abilities:** **Flash Fire** (provides immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts its own Fire attacks when hit); **White Smoke** (prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats); **Flame Body** (Hidden Ability that has a 30% chance to burn attackers who make contact).

## Evolution & Biology
Centiskorch is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sizzlipede** once it reaches **Level 28**. Biologically, it is characterized by its radiator-like organs on its underbelly that generate intense heat by burning fermented food within its body. Its fire-type nature is so dominant that it can learn moves like *Scald* and *Scorching Sands* to handle diverse threats. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a medium growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. While it lacks a natural habitat in many regions, it is frequently associated with hot environments or areas where its pre-evolution, Sizzlipede, can find ample organic matter to consume.
