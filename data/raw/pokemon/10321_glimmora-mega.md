## Identity & Lore
Mega Glimmora (Pokedex #10321) is the apex form of the Ore Pokémon, representing a potent evolution of the species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Its body is a complex biological marvel composed of vibrant blue, crystalline petals that secrete a highly lethal poison. Found primarily within the crystalline depths of the Great Crater of Paldea (Area Zero), it functions as a sentient mineral organism that mimics the appearance of a flower. When it senses a threat, it unfurls its petals to expose its conical core, firing concentrated energy beams that can melt solid rock. While standard Glimmora are often seen as the signature Pokémon of Top Champion Geeta, this Mega-evolved state represents a theoretical peak of its energy-saturation, enhancing its stature to a height of 2.8 meters.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 83, Attack 90, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 150, Sp. Def 96, Speed 101.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Tank-Breaker. With a towering Special Attack base of 150, Mega Glimmora is designed to puncture holes in defensive cores while maintaining enough bulk to survive neutral hits.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**. Additionally, it is **weak to Water, Psychic, Steel, and Fighting**. Defensively, it provides excellent utility by **resisting Fairy, Poison, Flying, Bug, Fire, and Normal-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Special Attack and competitive speed tier, Mega Glimmora utilizes **Sludge Wave** for high-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Power Gem** to exploit its Rock-typing against Flying and Fire types, **Earth Power** for essential coverage against opposing Steel types, and **Mortal Spin**, a unique utility move that clears hazards while simultaneously poisoning the opponent.
* **Abilities:** As a Mega Evolution of Glimmora, it typically utilizes **Toxic Debris**, a tactical ability that scatters Toxic Spikes across the opponent's side of the field whenever the Pokémon is hit by a physical attack. It may also possess **Corrosion**, which allows it to inflict the Poison status even on Steel and Poison-type Pokémon that are usually immune.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Glimmora is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It begins its lifecycle as **Glimmet**, a small ore-based entity found clinging to cave walls. Glimmet undergoes a metamorphosis and evolves into **Glimmora** starting at **Level 35**. This Mega form is achieved through the influence of specialized regional phenomena that push its crystalline structure to expand. Biologically, it is classified within the **Mineral** egg group, and its growth rate is categorized as medium-slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full combat potential. Despite its floral appearance, it is entirely mineralogic and does not possess organic plant tissue.
