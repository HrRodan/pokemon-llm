## Identity & Lore
Nymble (Pokedex #919) is the Grasshopper Pokémon, a nimble Bug-type introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This small, gray, armor-shaped Pokémon is characterized by its unique physiology, possessing a third set of legs that usually remain folded up against its body. When threatened or pushed into a "tough spot," Nymble can exert incredible strength, leaping over 30 feet in a single bound to escape predators or reposition during a struggle. As a common sight in the fields of the Paldea region, Nymble represents the initial stage of a warrior-like lineage that eventually gains the Dark typing upon evolving into Lokix. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form Lokix is noted for being the first Bug/Dark-type Pokémon in the series, making Nymble the foundational stage for a unique offensive archetype.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 33, Attack 46, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 21, Sp. Def 25, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Physical Revenge Killer / Early-Game Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Bug-type, Nymble is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Fire**. It provides defensive **resistances to Grass, Fighting, and Ground-type** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Nymble relies almost exclusively on its Physical Attack stat. Key moves in its repertoire include **First Impression**, a powerful Bug-type priority move that must be used on the first turn out; **Leech Life**, which provides both STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage and vital HP recovery; **X-Scissor** for consistent physical pressure; and **Sucker Punch**, which offers crucial dark-type priority to pick off faster, weakened opponents.
* **Abilities:** **Swarm** (Standard) increases the power of Bug-type moves by 50% when Nymble's HP falls below a third of its maximum. **Tinted Lens** (Hidden Ability) is its most potent competitive tool, doubling the damage of "not very effective" moves, allowing Nymble to bypass the resistances of enemy Steel, Poison, or Flying types.

## Evolution & Biology
Nymble is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable "Prowler Pokémon" **Lokix starting at Level 24**. Biologically, Nymble is designed for survival through evasion, using its powerful leg muscles to traverse the varied terrain of Paldea. It belongs to the **Bug Egg Group**, and trainers looking to breed this Pokémon should note a hatch counter of 20. Its growth rate is categorized as "Medium," making it a relatively easy Pokémon to train for young instructors venturing out from Mesagoza or Poco Path. Even in its base form, Nymble demonstrates high tactical utility through its access to utility moves like **U-turn**, allowing it to pivot out of unfavorable matchups while dealing chip damage.
