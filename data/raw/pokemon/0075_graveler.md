## Identity & Lore
Graveler (Pokedex #075) is the **Rock Pokémon**, a rugged and durable creature introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Primarily found in **mountain** habitats, this Pokémon possesses a rocky, brown hide and four arms, which it utilizes to climb steep cliffs. Graveler is biologically defined by its reckless locomotion; rather than walking, it curls into a ball and rolls down slopes at high speeds, crushing any obstacles—including massive boulders—without slowing or changing direction. While this profile details the standard form, a Rock/Electric regional variant exists in the Alola region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 95, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 45, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Hazard Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Rock/Ground** type, Graveler possesses profound defensive vulnerabilities, suffering from **Double Weaknesses (4x)** to both **Water** and **Grass** moves. It is also weak to **Fighting, Ground, Steel, and Ice**. However, it offers valuable resistance to Normal, Flying, Rock, and Fire types, complete immunity to **Electric** attacks, and a double resistance (0.25x) to Poison.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and Defense, Graveler excels with STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and utility moves such as **Earthquake**, **Stone Edge**, and **Stealth Rock** to pressure opponents. It is also famous for **Explosion**, a desperate final attack that deals massive damage before fainting.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage, allowing safe use of moves like Double-Edge.
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing at least one turn to set up hazards.
    *   **Sand Veil (Hidden):** Increases evasion during a sandstorm.

## Evolution & Biology
Graveler is the middle stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the **Mineral** Egg Group. It evolves from **Geodude** upon reaching **Level 25**. To reach its final form, **Golem**, Graveler must be **traded** to another trainer. This trade evolution requirement makes it unique compared to Pokémon that evolve simply through leveling or evolutionary stones.
