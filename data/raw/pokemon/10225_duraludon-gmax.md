## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Duraludon (Pokedex #10225) is the massive, skyscraper-inspired form of the Alloy Pokémon, a Steel/Dragon-type native to the Galar region (Generation VIII). When Duraludon undergoes Gigantamaxing, its body swells to a height of over 43 meters, resembling a futuristic tower composed of incredibly durable, polished metal. While its structure is surprisingly lightweight and strong, the metal composing its body is susceptible to corrosion and rust. In its Gigantamax state, it possesses the unique G-Max Move **G-Max Depletion**, which not only deals massive Dragon-type damage but also reduces the PP of the last move used by its targets. Beyond this G-Max form, the species gained further prominence in the Paldea region (Generation IX), where it was discovered that Duraludon possesses a further evolutionary stage known as Archaludon.

## Evolution & Biology
Duraludon is part of a two-stage evolutionary line that was recently expanded. In the Galar region, it was known as a standalone species capable of Gigantamaxing; however, biological breakthroughs in the Blueberry Academy (Unova/Paldea context) revealed that Duraludon evolves into **Archaludon** when exposed to a **Metal Alloy**. It belongs to the **Mineral and Dragon** Egg Groups, with its biology deeply tied to the consumption of stones found in mountainous caves, often leading to territorial disputes with Tyranitar. In its Gigantamax form, the concentrated energy within its cells allows its body to glow with neon-like intensity, making it a literal beacon on the battlefield.
