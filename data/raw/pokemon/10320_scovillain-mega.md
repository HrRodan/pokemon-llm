## Identity & Lore
Mega Scovillain (Pokedex #10320) is the Mega Evolved form of the Spicy Pepper Pokémon, a unique dual-type specimen first discovered in the Paldea region of Generation IX. This Pokémon is biologically distinct for its two heads—a green head that provides its Grass-type properties and a red head that synthesizes spicy chemicals into volatile fire energy. While the base form is known for its erratic temperament, the Mega Evolution destabilizes its spicy oils further, drastically increasing its offensive output. In its Paldean habitat, Scovillain is often seen basking in intense sunlight to fuel its internal chemical reactions. Though Mega Evolution is not natively present in the Paldea region's standard timeline, this form represents a hypothetical peak of its "spicy" potential, augmenting its ability to blast the surrounding area with super-spicy streams of flame.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 138, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 138, Sp. Def 85, Speed 75.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker. With perfectly symmetrical offensive stats of 138, Mega Scovillain can dismantle opponents from either the physical or special side.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, and Rock**. Its unique Grass/Fire typing grants it **resistances to Fairy, Electric, and Steel**, and a notable **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Grass**. Notably, its Fire typing neutralizes the standard Fire and Ice weaknesses usually found in Grass types, and its Grass typing neutralizes the standard Water weakness of Fire types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive dual offenses, Mega Scovillain excels with **Fire Blast** and **Leaf Storm** for immediate special burst damage, while **Flare Blitz** and **Seed Bomb** allow it to punish specially defensive walls.
* **Abilities:** While its specific Mega ability is often tied to sun-based synergy, its base forms utilize **Chlorophyll** (doubling Speed in sun), **Solar Power** (boosting Special Attack in sun at the cost of HP), and the volatile **Moody** (raising one stat sharply while lowering another).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Scovillain is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line that begins with **Capsakid**. Capsakid, a pure Grass-type, evolves into the dual-type Scovillain **when exposed to a Fire Stone**. The transformation into Mega Scovillain occurs during battle when Scovillain holds its specific Mega Stone. Biologically, this Pokémon belongs to the **Plant** egg group. Its growth is categorized as medium, requiring a steady intake of nutrients to maintain the high-energy production of its fire-breathing red head. Its physical form is characterized as "upright," allowing it to pivot between its two heads to adapt to various environmental threats or culinary opportunities.
