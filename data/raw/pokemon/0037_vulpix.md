## Identity & Lore
Vulpix (Pokedex #037) is the Fire-type Fox Pokémon originally discovered in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Renowned for its elegance and intelligence, this quadrupedal Pokémon is characterized by its reddish-brown pelt and large, soulful eyes. Lore dictates that at the time of birth, Vulpix possesses only one white tail; as it receives love from its trainer and grows stronger, this single tail splits from the tip, eventually developing into six distinct, magnificent tails. A denizen of grassy plains and **grassland** habitats, Vulpix is capable of manipulating fire, often expelling small flames from its mouth to control its internal body temperature. While this profile focuses on the standard Fire-type form, Vulpix is notable for having a regional **Alolan Form**, which adapts to snowy environments as an Ice-type.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 38, Attack 41, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 65, Speed 65.
*   **Archetype:** Little Cup Utility / Fast Special Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fire-type, it is **weak to Ground, Rock, and Water**. It **resists Bug, Steel, Grass, Ice, Fire, and Fairy**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its higher Speed and Special Attack, Vulpix effectively utilizes **Flamethrower** or **Fire Blast** for primary STAB damage. For coverage against Rock and Water threats, **Energy Ball** is essential. **Extrasensory** provides coverage against Fighting and Poison types, while **Will-O-Wisp** serves as a crucial utility move to burn physical attackers. **Nasty Plot** is also a viable option to boost its offensive presence.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Flash Fire:** Grants immunity to Fire-type moves and boosts the power of its own Fire moves by 50% when hit by one.
    *   **Drought (Hidden Ability):** Summons harsh sunlight when entering battle. This is highly competitively viable, allowing Vulpix to support Chlorophyll users and boost its own Fire damage immediately.

## Evolution & Biology
Vulpix is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Ninetales** when exposed to a **Fire Stone**. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20. Notably, the evolution into Ninetales is irreversible and results in a significant stat boost and a shift towards a more mystical, long-lived physiology. (Note: The Alolan variant evolves via Ice Stone, though the standard Vulpix requires the Fire Stone).
