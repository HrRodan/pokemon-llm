## Identity & Lore
Chansey (Pokédex #113) is the pink, upright Egg Pokémon known for its extreme rarity and benevolent nature. Introduced in Generation I (Kanto), this fairy-like creature resides primarily in urban environments or hidden wild areas like the Safari Zone. Famous for carrying a nutritious egg in its abdominal pouch, Chansey is said to bring happiness and good fortune to those who catch it. In the broader Pokémon world, it acts as a dedicated medical assistant in Pokémon Centers. While it is not fully evolved, Chansey is unique in that it is often competitively superior to its evolution, Blissey, when holding the **Eviolite** item, which boosts its defenses significantly.
