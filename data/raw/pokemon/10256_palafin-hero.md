## Identity & Lore
Palafin-Hero (Pokedex #964) is the Hero Form of the Dolphin Pokémon, a transformation that occurs when this aquatic protector hears its allies calling for help. Introduced in Generation IX (Paldea), this form represents a dramatic physiological shift from its unassuming "Zero Form." While it retains its blue coloration and dolphin-like silhouette, Palafin-Hero stands upright with a robust, humanoid physique, symbolizing its role as a maritime superhero. It is notoriously secretive, refusing to let anyone witness the exact moment of its transformation. This Pokémon does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, as its "Hero" state already grants it a base stat total comparable to legendary Pokémon like Kyogre or Groudon.

## Evolution & Biology
Palafin-Hero is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Finizen** starting at Level 38, but with a unique social requirement: it must level up while the player is connected to others via the **Union Circle** (multiplayer mode). Biologically, it is highly social and protective, belonging to the **Field (Ground) and Water 2** Egg Groups. Despite its mammalian appearance, it is remarkably heavy at 97.4 kg, a weight that powers its physical maneuvers. Its growth rate is slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential, reflecting the discipline required of a Paldean hero.
