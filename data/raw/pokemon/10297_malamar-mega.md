## Identity & Lore
Mega Malamar (Pokedex #10297) is the Mega Evolved form of the Overturning Pokémon, a sinister and powerful entity originally discovered in the Kalos region of Generation VI. As a Dark and Psychic-type, it possesses a deep blue, bioluminescent coloration and a physical structure that appears as an inverted, highly evolved cephalopod. Mega Malamar is renowned for possessing the most compelling hypnotic powers of any known Pokémon, capable of bending the will of others to its own desire. While the base form is already a master of subversion, this Mega Evolution enhances its cerebral and physical dominance. In its standard form, Malamar is the only Pokémon known to utilize the move Topsy-Turvy to completely reverse an opponent's stat changes, a theme of "overturning" that defines its entire biological and combat existence.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 86, Attack 102, Defense 88, Sp. Atk 98, Sp. Def 120, Speed 88.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Mixed Attacker / Special Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug-type moves** and a weakness to **Fairy**. It is completely **immune to Psychic-type moves** due to its Dark typing.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Attack and Special Defense, Mega Malamar excels with a movepool that disrupts and punishes. Key moves include **Night Slash** (high critical-hit ratio), **Superpower** (which traditionally synergizes with its lore-accurate ability to reverse stat drops), **Psycho Cut** (utilizing its physical prowess), and **Dark Pulse** (to capitalize on its nearly equal Special Attack).
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-form abilities vary, it is rooted in the lineage of **Contrary**, an ability that makes stat changes have the opposite effect (e.g., a defense drop becomes a defense boost). This makes it a terrifying presence against opponents who rely on Intimidate or stat-lowering moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Malamar is the final stage of a unique two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Inkay** starting at **Level 30**. In a display of its "Overturning" nature, the evolution into Malamar is triggered specifically when the Pokémon is leveled up while the physical orientation of its environment (or the trainer's device) is held upside down. Biologically, it is classified within the **Water 1 and Water 2 Egg Groups**, reflecting its aquatic, squid-like physiology despite its primary habitat often being on land or in dark caverns. It has a medium growth rate and is known for its high base happiness, though its flavor text suggests a much more predatory and manipulative temperament.
