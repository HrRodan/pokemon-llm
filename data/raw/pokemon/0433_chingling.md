## Identity & Lore
Chingling (Pokedex #433) is the Bell Pokémon introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. A small, yellow, spherical spirit, it is a **Baby Pokémon** characterized by the red orb located inside its mouth. By agitating this orb at the back of its throat, Chingling emits high-frequency cries that can deafen opponents or communicate with others of its kind over long distances. Unlike many Pokémon that walk or float, it moves with distinctive flouncing hops. As a Baby Pokémon, it is unable to breed, and while it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it serves as the immature form of the wind-chime Pokémon, Chimecho.

## Evolution & Biology
Chingling is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Chimecho** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (220+) specifically during the **Night**. As a Baby Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group; to obtain a Chingling through breeding, a Chimecho parent typically must hold a **Pure Incense** (World Knowledge) before producing an egg.
