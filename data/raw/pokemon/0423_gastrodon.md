## Identity & Lore
Gastrodon (Pokedex #423) is the Water/Ground-type Sea Slug Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its unique biology, Gastrodon appears in two distinct geographic forms listed as **West Sea** (typically pink and brown) and **East Sea** (typically blue and green), representing divergence based on its habitat relative to Mt. Coronet. Anatomically, it possesses a pliable, boneless body; if any part of its body is torn off by predators or natural hazards, it has the regenerative capability to grow it back immediately. It is commonly found in beach and shallow water habitats.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sticky Hold:** Prevents the Pokémon's held item from being stolen by moves like Knock Off or Thief.
    *   **Storm Drain:** Draws in all Water-type moves used by opponents in doubles, nullifying the damage and raising Gastrodon's Special Attack.

## Evolution & Biology
Gastrodon is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Shellos** starting at **Level 30**. The specific form (East Sea or West Sea) is determined by the form of the Shellos prior to evolution; it cannot change forms after being caught. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Indeterminate** Egg Groups.
