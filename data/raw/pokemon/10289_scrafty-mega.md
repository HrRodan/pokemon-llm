## Identity & Lore
Mega Scrafty (Pokedex #10289) is the Mega Evolved form of the Hoodlum Pokémon, a belligerent Dark/Fighting-type first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Known for its distinctive "hoodie" made of its own saggy skin, Mega Scrafty is a territorial brawler that leads groups to aggressively defend their turf. These Pokémon are notorious for their rude behavior, often spitting acidic liquid at those who challenge them. While the base form is recognized for its defensive capabilities, this Mega Evolution pushes its physical prowess and durability to extreme levels. Its red coloration and upright, lizard-like shape emphasize its "street fighter" aesthetic, blending the rugged nature of a city hoodlum with the draconic traits of its ancestry.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 130, Defense 135, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 135, Speed 68.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** Mega Scrafty is **weak to Fighting and Bug**, and possesses a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Rock, Ghost, and Dark**, and maintains a total **immunity to Psychic** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** With its massive base 130 Attack and low Special Attack, Mega Scrafty excels with physical strikes. Key moves include **Drain Punch** (for high-damage recovery), **Knock Off** (to remove enemy items and provide STAB utility), **High Jump Kick** (its most powerful Fighting-type nuke), and **Dragon Dance** (to boost its mediocre Speed and already threatening Attack).
* **Abilities:** While its Mega-specific ability varies in different combat simulations, it traditionally draws from its base form's tactical strengths: **Intimidate** (cuts the opponent's Attack upon entry), **Moxie** (boosts Attack after a knockout), or **Shed Skin** (provides a chance to heal status conditions like Burn or Paralysis). These abilities allow it to either tank physical hits or become a runaway "sweep" threat.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Scrafty is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary progression. It begins its life as **Scraggy**, which evolves into **Scrafty** upon reaching **Level 39**. Under the influence of a specialized Mega Stone, Scrafty undergoes a temporary transformation into Mega Scrafty, bursting with draconic energy. Biologically, it is highly unique, belonging to both the **Ground** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, hinting at its hidden draconic potential despite its urban behavior. With a hatch counter of 15, it is a relatively rare sight for breeders, requiring significant patience to raise from an egg. Its red-scaled skin is incredibly tough, serving as natural armor that explains its massive base 135 Defense and Special Defense.
