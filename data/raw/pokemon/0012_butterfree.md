## Identity & Lore
Butterfree (Pokedex #012) is the Butterfly Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Flying creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). It is known for its large, white wings covered in toxic scales; as noted in its biological profile, it flaps these wings at high speeds to release highly toxic dust into the air during battle. Primarily found in forest habitats, Butterfree searches for honey in flowers and can carry honey from blooming flowers back to its nest. While not a Mega-Evolvable species, Butterfree possesses a unique **Gigantamax form** capable of using the exclusive G-Max Move, *G-Max Befuddle*.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 45, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 80, Speed 70.
*   **Archetype:** Special Setup Sweeper / Disrupter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Bug/Flying type, it suffers a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock** attacks (making it highly vulnerable to Stealth Rock). It is also weak to Flying, Fire, Electric, and Ice. However, it boasts an **Immunity to Ground** and double resistances (1/4 damage) to Fighting and Grass types.
*   **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack (90) and accuracy-boosting abilities, its optimal moveset includes **Quiver Dance** (to boost Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed), **Sleep Powder** (for crowd control), **Bug Buzz** (reliable STAB), and **Hurricane** (high-power Flying STAB).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Compound Eyes:** Increases the accuracy of moves by 30%. This is tactically vital for landing low-accuracy moves like *Sleep Powder* and *Hurricane*.
    *   **Tinted Lens (Hidden Ability):** "Not very effective" moves deal double damage, allowing Butterfree to break through type resistances.

## Evolution & Biology
Butterfree is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line characterized by extremely rapid growth. It evolves from **Metapod** starting at **Level 10**, following its initial evolution from **Caterpie** at Level 7. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches relatively quickly compared to other species.
