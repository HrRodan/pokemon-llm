## Identity & Lore
Jynx (Pokedex #124) is the Human Shape Pokémon first discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Resembling a woman in a red gown with long blonde hair, this Ice/Psychic-type is known for its rhythmic, swaying movements. It seductively wiggles its hips as it walks, a behavior that compels people and other Pokémon to dance in unison with it. Jynx communicates using a cry that sounds remarkably like human speech, though the language remains impossible to decipher. It is an exclusively female species often found in urban environments. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is part of the "elemental punch" trio association alongside Magmar and Electabuzz, largely due to their pre-evolutions introduced in Generation II.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 50, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 115, Sp. Def 95, Speed 95.
*   **Archetype:** Fragile Special Sweeper / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** It suffers from poor defensive typing, being **weak to Rock, Bug, Ghost, Steel, Fire, and Dark**. It **resists Ice and Psychic** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Ice Beam** (STAB), **Psychic** (STAB), **Lovely Kiss** (Signature utility to induce Sleep), and **Nasty Plot** (to sharply boost Special Attack). **Focus Blast** is a viable alternative for coverage against Steel-types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming infatuated or falling for taunts.
    *   **Forewarn:** Reveals the opponent's move with the highest base power upon entering battle.
    *   **Dry Skin (Hidden):** Tactically significant; it restores HP when hit by Water-type moves or during rain, effectively granting a Water immunity, but increases damage taken from Fire-type moves and reduces HP in harsh sunlight.

## Evolution & Biology
Jynx is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Smoochum** starting at **Level 30**. Unlike many Pokémon, Jynx does not evolve further. It belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group. Biologically, its body temperature is extremely low, allowing it to freeze moisture in the air to launch attacks.
