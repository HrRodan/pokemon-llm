## Identity & Lore
Spinda (Pokedex #327) is the Spot Panda Pokémon, a unique Normal-type entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Renowned for its dizzying biology, no two Spinda possess the exact same pattern of reddish spots, resulting in over four billion possible visual variations. Inhabiting mountainous terrain, its perpetually tottering, unstable gait is actually a sophisticated defense mechanism; this confused movement pattern makes its trajectory impossible to predict, causing foes to miss their aim. Spinda does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 60, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Physical Disruptor / Gimmick Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**.
* **Move Selection:** Due to its perfectly balanced but low stats, Spinda relies on disruption and utility. Key moves include **Teeter Dance** (to confuse all adjacent Pokémon), **Double-Edge** (high power STAB), **Sucker Punch** (priority to compensate for average speed), and **Drain Punch** (for longevity).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused, allowing it to use moves like Thrash or Teeter Dance without penalty.
    *   **Tangled Feet:** Raises evasion if the Pokémon becomes confused.
    *   **Contrary (Hidden Ability):** Inverts stat changes (e.g., lowering a stat raises it instead), making Spinda a unique threat when utilizing stat-dropping moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Spinda is a stand-alone Pokémon that belongs to a single-stage line; it **does not evolve** from or into any other species. In the wild, it may be found holding a **Chesto Berry**. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Human-Like** (Humanshape) Egg Groups and hatches quickly compared to other species.
