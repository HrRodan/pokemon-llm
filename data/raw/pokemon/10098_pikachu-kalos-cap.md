## Identity & Lore
Kalos Cap Pikachu (Pokedex #10098) is a special variant of the Mouse Pokémon, distinguished by the iconic hat worn by its trainer, Ash Ketchum, during his travels in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I), this yellow, quadrupedal Pokémon is known to congregate in forests, where the combined electrical discharge of many individuals can trigger massive lightning storms. While this specific form is categorized under the base Pikachu species, it represents a unique cross-generational legacy. Beyond its standard form, Pikachu is famous for its ability to **Gigantamax**, transforming into a massive, long-tailed powerhouse, and its access to the exclusive Z-Move **10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt** when holding a Pikashunium Z.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 55, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Fast Glass Cannon / Utility Pivot. While its base stats are humble, its high Speed allows it to act as a disruptor before it can be struck.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Electric-type, it is **weak to Ground** and **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel**.
* **Move Selection:** To maximize its utility and Speed, Kalos Cap Pikachu excels with moves like **Thunderbolt** for reliable STAB damage, **Volt Switch** for pivoting out of danger, **Nuzzle** for guaranteed paralysis against opponents, and **Play Rough** for unexpected Fairy-type physical coverage.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Static:** Provides a 30% chance to paralyze attackers who make contact, punishing physical sweepers.
    * **Lightning Rod (Hidden):** Grants immunity to Electric-type moves and boosts Special Attack when hit by one, making it an excellent switch-in for predicted electric attacks.
* **Tactical Note:** This Pokémon is traditionally balanced around the **Light Ball** held item, which doubles its physical Attack and Special Attack stats, significantly increasing its offensive threat level.

## Evolution & Biology
Kalos Cap Pikachu is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this specific "Cap" form is typically unable to evolve into Raichu. In the standard biological cycle, it begins as **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+)**. A standard Pikachu would then evolve into Raichu when exposed to a **Thunder Stone** (or Alolan Raichu if in the Alola region). It belongs to the **Ground** and **Fairy** Egg Groups, and despite its small size (0.4m, 6.0kg), it is a highly resilient species found in wooded habitats.
