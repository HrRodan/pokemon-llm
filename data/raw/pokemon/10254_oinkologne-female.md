## Identity & Lore
Female Oinkologne (Pokedex #10254) is the Hog Pokémon, a quintessential Normal-type introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This particular variant is the female form, which distinguishes itself from its male counterpart through both its physical appearance—sporting a more subtle, darker coloration—and its distinctive aroma. According to Paldean biological records, it is extremely proud of its fine, glossy skin and possesses a tail that emits a concentrated, floral scent used to influence the behavior of other Pokémon. While Oinkologne does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, it serves as a common and reliable companion for trainers beginning their journey across the Paldea region, often found in grassy fields and early-route habitats.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 115, Attack 90, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 59, Sp. Def 90, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Specially Defensive Tank / Physical Bruiser. With a massive base HP and respectable Special Defense, it is built to survive special onslaughts while retaliating with consistent physical pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**. It lacks any 4x double weaknesses, making it a stable, if predictable, defensive presence.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior base 90 Attack stat over its meager Special Attack, optimal moves include **Body Slam** (for STAB damage and paralysis chance), **Play Rough** (for Fairy-type coverage against Fighting and Dragon types), **High Horsepower** (powerful Ground-type coverage), and **Zen Headbutt** (specifically to counter the Fighting-types it is weak to).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Aroma Veil:** Protects the Pokémon and its allies from effects that limit their move choices, such as Taunt, Torment, and Encore; this is highly valuable in VGC and Double Battles. 
    * **Gluttony:** Causes the Pokémon to consume its held berry earlier than usual (at 50% HP instead of 25%).
    * **Thick Fat (Hidden Ability):** Provides significant defensive utility by halving the damage taken from Fire-type and Ice-type moves, effectively giving Oinkologne two pseudo-resistances.

## Evolution & Biology
Oinkologne-female is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Lechonk starting at Level 18, with its physical form and base stats determined by its gender upon evolution. Biologically, it is a sturdy quadruped belonging to the Ground (Field) Egg Group. Trainers breeding Lechonk can expect a hatch counter of approximately 15 cycles. Its behavior is characterized by cleanliness and a refined sense of smell, often using its powerful snout and tail-scent to forage for the finest berries and grasses in the wild.
