## Identity & Lore
Tinkaton (Pokedex #959) is the Hammer Pokémon, a bold and highly intelligent species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Standing only 0.7 meters tall but weighing a massive 112.8 kilograms—largely due to the colossal, handcrafted hammer it wields—this pink, humanoid Pokémon is known for its daring and somewhat mischievous disposition. Tinkaton possesses a natural predatory intellect, famously using its hammer to swat rocks into the sky with pinpoint accuracy to knock flying Corviknight out of the air. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its hammer is said to be forged from scrap metal stolen from other Steel-type Pokémon, growing in size as it evolves.

## Evolution & Biology
Tinkaton is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Tinkatink**, which evolves into **Tinkatuff** starting at Level 24. Tinkatuff then evolves into the final form, **Tinkaton**, starting at Level 38. Biologically, the line is defined by the evolution of their tool; what begins as a small rattle-like club for Tinkatink becomes a massive, 100-pound mallet by the time it reaches its final stage. Tinkaton belongs to the **Fairy** egg group and has a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential.
