## Identity & Lore
Revavroom (Pokedex #966) is the Multi-Cyl Pokémon, a mechanical Steel/Poison-type lifeform first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This gray, engine-like Pokémon is a biological marvel that creates energy by detonating a mixture of poison and minerals within its eight cylinders. It is most famously associated with Team Star, where it serves as the core engine for their customized "Starmobiles," showcasing unique Boss forms known as the Schedar, Segin, Navi, Ruchba, and Caph Starmobiles, each possessing different types and signatures. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its integration with Team Star’s technology represents one of the most unique "form-adjacent" mechanics in the Pokémon world. Its body is composed of discarded scrap metal and toxic components, often found clinging to rocks to harvest the minerals it needs for fuel.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 119, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 54, Sp. Def 67, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground** and is also weak to **Fire** and **Fighting**. However, its typing provides an incredible number of resistances, including Normal, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, Dragon, and Steel, with a double resistance (0.25x) to **Grass** and **Fairy**. It is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Attack stat and signature speed control, Revavroom excels with **Shift Gear** (which raises Attack and sharply raises Speed), **Iron Head** for reliable Steel-type STAB, **Gunk Shot** for high-power Poison-type damage, and **High Horsepower** for essential Ground-type coverage against other Steel types.
* **Abilities:** **Overcoat** (protects the Pokémon from weather damage and powder-based moves like Sleep Powder or Spore). Its Hidden Ability, **Filter**, is highly prized in competitive play as it reduces the damage taken from super-effective moves by 25%, helping it survive its crippling Ground-type weakness.

## Evolution & Biology
Revavroom is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Varoom** starting at **Level 40**. Biologically, the transition from Varoom to Revavroom involves the expansion of its cylinder count, allowing it to process more toxic fuel and achieve higher speeds. Revavroom belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its mechanical appearance, it is a living organism that requires specific minerals to maintain its metallic exterior. It has a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively standard Pokémon to breed for competitive IVs.
