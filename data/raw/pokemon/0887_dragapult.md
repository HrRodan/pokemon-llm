## Identity & Lore
Dragapult (Pokedex #887) is the Stealth Pokémon, a powerful Ghost and Dragon-type Pseudo-Legendary originating from the Galar region (Generation VIII). Its design is a fascinating blend of prehistoric biology and modern military technology, resembling the extinct *Diplocaulus* combined with a stealth bomber. This green, spectral predator is known for its unique symbiotic and paternal behavior; it carries its pre-evolved forms, Dreepy, within the hollows of its flat, triangular head. In a display of "supersonic" combat, Dragapult launches these Dreepy like missiles at its opponents, a behavior the Dreepy reportedly look forward to with excitement. While Dragapult does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its sheer speed and versatility have made it a dominant force in competitive circuits since its discovery.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 88, Attack 120, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 75, Speed 142.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper / Offensive Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ice, Dragon, Fairy, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses valuable **resistances to Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Poison, and Bug**, and is completely **immune to Normal and Fighting-type attacks**.
* **Move Selection:** Dragapult leverages its incredible speed and high Attack to pressure opponents. Key moves include its signature **Dragon Darts**, which hits twice in one turn, **Phantom Force** for spectral STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **U-turn** to maintain momentum and pivot out of danger, and **Dragon Dance** to boost its already lethal offensive stats. Due to its solid 100 Sp. Atk, it can also effectively run special moves like *Shadow Ball* or *Fire Blast* to catch physical walls off-guard.
* **Abilities:** **Clear Body** (Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats, making it immune to Intimidate), **Infiltrator** (Allows its moves to bypass the effects of Substitute, Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil), and **Cursed Body** (Hidden Ability; has a 30% chance of disabling a move that deals damage to it).

## Evolution & Biology
Dragapult is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, representing one of the most time-intensive growth cycles in the Galar region. It evolves from **Drakloak** starting at **Level 60**. The journey begins with **Dreepy**, which evolves into Drakloak starting at **Level 50**. Biologically, Dragapult is a spectral being that once lived in prehistoric seas; its ghost-type nature allows it to fade into the air and reappear unexpectedly. It belongs to the **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, and breeders should note its slow growth rate and high hatch counter (40 cycles), reflecting its status as a high-tier Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon.
