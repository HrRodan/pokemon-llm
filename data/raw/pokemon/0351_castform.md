## Identity & Lore
Castform (Pokédex #351) is the Artificial **Weather Pokémon**, first introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Unlike most Pokémon found in the wild, Castform was scientifically created by the researchers at the **Weather Institute** to predict and manipulate atmospheric conditions. While its base form resembles a small, grey cloud, its molecular structure is highly unstable, allowing it to physically alter its appearance and typing based on the current weather. Through its signature capability, it possesses three distinct alternate forms: the **Sunny Form**, **Rainy Form**, and **Snowy Form**. It resides primarily in grasslands or near weather research facilities.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 70, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 70, Speed 70.
*   **Archetype:** Versatile Weather Specialist.
*   **Type Matchups:** In its default state, it is **weak to Fighting** and **immune to Ghost**. However, its defensive profile shifts dynamically; it becomes Fire-type in sun (Weak to Water, Ground, Rock), Water-type in rain (Weak to Electric, Grass), and Ice-type in hail/snow (Weak to Fire, Fighting, Rock, Steel).
*   **Move Selection:** Castform relies on high-power moves that exploit weather conditions. Its optimal kit includes **Weather Ball** (which doubles in power and changes type with the weather), **Hurricane** (perfect accuracy in rain), **Thunder** (perfect accuracy in rain), and **Fire Blast** (boosted by sun).
*   **Abilities:** **Forecast** (This signature ability allows Castform to change its type and form to Fire, Water, or Ice depending on the weather conditions. It reverts to its Normal type if the weather clears or turns to a Sandstorm).

## Evolution & Biology
Castform is a standalone species and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Fairy** and **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Groups. While it does not undergo traditional evolution, its biology is unique due to its artificial origins, designed specifically to resonate with nature's power to protect its tiny body. In the wild, it is occasionally found holding **Mystic Water**.
