## Identity & Lore
Magmortar (Pokedex #467) is the Blast Pokémon, a powerful Fire-type entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its artillery-like physiology, Magmortar possesses arms that function as launchers capable of blasting fireballs at temperatures exceeding 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit. These projectiles are hot enough to turn the air around them into a shimmering heat haze. It primarily inhabits the craters of volcanoes, a suitable environment for its intense body heat. While it generally keeps a red, intimidating appearance, its breath becomes searingly hot when it prepares for battle.
