## Identity & Lore
Minior-Green (Pokedex #10139) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique Rock/Flying-type celestial entity first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This specific variant represents the "Green Core" form of Minior, which is revealed only after its heavy outer shell has been shattered. Originally making its home in the ozone layer, Minior survives by consuming dust; when it has consumed too much, its shell becomes too heavy, and it hurtles down to the planet's surface in a meteor-like descent. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Minior is biologically unique for its "Shields Down" cycle, existing in two distinct states: a defensive Meteor Form and this vulnerable, high-speed Core Form. In Alola, it is often studied for its relationship to the atmosphere and its variety of vibrant core colors, which are determined by the composition of the dust it consumed in space.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper. In its Core Form, Minior sacrifices its massive defensive bulk for a significant boost in offensive presence and elite speed.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, and Steel**. It **resists Normal, Flying, Poison, and Fire**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground** thanks to its Flying typing.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its balanced offensive stats and its signature setup potential, key moves include **Shell Smash** (to double its offensive pressure), **Acrobatics** (which doubles in power if Minior is not holding an item, often after a White Herb is consumed), **Power Gem** for reliable Special Rock STAB, and **Earthquake** for vital coverage against Steel and Electric types.
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon starts in its Meteor Form with high defenses and status immunity; when its HP drops below 50%, the shell breaks, transforming it into this high-speed Green Core form while increasing its Attack and Special Attack stats).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species; however, it undergoes a dramatic biological transformation during combat. This Green Core variant is part of a diverse spectrum of colors including Red, Orange, Yellow, Blue, Indigo, and Violet cores. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its rocky exterior, it is a living organism that requires a specific atmospheric diet to maintain its shell. When its shell is broken, it becomes light and agile, but its life span becomes precarious as it begins to dissipate without its protective coating. In competitive environments, it is often bred for high IVs in both offensive categories to make the most of its "Shell Smash" versatility.
