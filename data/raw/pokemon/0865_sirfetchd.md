## Identity & Lore
Sirfetch'd (Pokedex #865) is the Wild Duck Pokémon, a noble and gallant warrior that represents the pinnacle of martial discipline in the Galar region (Generation VIII). This Pokémon is the exclusive evolution of the Galarian variant of Farfetch'd, a transformation that only occurs after it has survived countless harrowing battles. Sirfetch'd is easily distinguished by its pristine white plumage, its stern, focused expression, and the massive, oversized leek it wields as both a lance and a sturdy shield. Its behavior is defined by a strict code of chivalry; it is known to fight fairly and with great honor, making it a favorite subject for artists in the Galar region. Lore states that when its leek finally withers, Sirfetch'd will retire from the battlefield entirely. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence is a significant departure from its Kantonian cousin, which lacks an evolutionary stage.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 62, Attack 135, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 68, Sp. Def 82, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Bulky Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Sirfetch'd leverages its monumental Attack stat with high-impact physical maneuvers. Key moves in its arsenal include **Meteor Assault** (its signature move with massive power), **Close Combat** (for reliable high-STAB damage), **Leaf Blade** (taking advantage of its high critical-hit ratio), and **First Impression** (a powerful Bug-type priority move to catch opponents off-guard).
* **Abilities:** **Steadfast** (increases Speed when the Pokémon flinches) and its Hidden Ability, **Scrappy** (allows it to hit Ghost-type Pokémon with Normal and Fighting-type moves, while also making it immune to the Intimidate ability). In competitive play, Scrappy is highly valued for ensuring no Pokémon can safely switch into its Fighting-type attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Sirfetch'd is the second and final stage of its evolutionary line. It evolves from **Galarian Farfetch'd** through a unique and demanding martial feat: it must land **three critical hits in a single battle**. This requirement mirrors the flavor text regarding its battle-hardened nature. Biologically, it is a heavy Pokémon for its size, weighing 117.0kg due to the density of its specialized leek weaponry. It belongs to the **Flying and Ground** Egg Groups, and despite its knightly appearance, it retains the biological traits of a migratory waterfowl. Growing at a medium rate, it is a challenging but rewarding Pokémon for trainers to raise, requiring strategic use of items like the Leek to increase critical hit ratios to trigger its evolution.
