## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Decidueye (Pokedex #10244) is the Arrow Quill Pokémon, a distinct regional variant that evolved in the rugged, ancient wilderness of the Hisui region (Generation VIII). Unlike its Alolan counterpart, which is a Grass/Ghost type, this form adapted to the cold, mountainous climate of ancient Sinnoh by developing a Grass/Fighting typing and a stoic, ronin-like demeanor. It is a master of precision, capable of firing arrow quills from its wings with enough force and accuracy to pierce a pebble at distances exceeding a hundred yards. Its plumage resembles traditional woven straw capes used for protection against the elements. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it stands as a unique evolutionary branch of the Rowlet line, specifically triggered by the unique environmental energy of the Hisui region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 88, Attack 112, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 95, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Flying**, and is also weak to **Poison, Bug, Fire, Ice, Psychic, and Fairy**. It resists **Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, Rock, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high physical Attack stat and signature capabilities, its optimal moveset includes **Triple Arrows** (its signature Fighting-type move that increases critical hit ratio and lowers the foe's Defense), **Leaf Blade** (for high-crit STAB damage), **Close Combat** (for massive raw power), and **Sucker Punch** (to compensate for its low Speed with priority).
* **Abilities:** **Overgrow** (Powers up Grass-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third) and **Scrappy** (Its Hidden Ability, which allows it to hit Ghost-type Pokémon with Normal and Fighting-type moves, while also providing immunity to the Intimidate ability).

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Decidueye is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Rowlet**, which evolves into **Dartrix** starting at Level 17. In the Hisui region, Dartrix further evolves into **Hisuian Decidueye** starting at Level 34. This transformation is heavily influenced by the specific climate of the region; outside of Hisui, Dartrix typically evolves into the standard Alolan form. It belongs to the **Flying** egg group and is noted for a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Biologically, its feathers have evolved to be sturdier and more rigid than its Alolan cousin's, serving as both effective projectiles and armor.
