## Identity & Lore
Shiftry (#275) is the Wicked Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Dark entity native to the forests of Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a mysterious, arboreal guardian with a brown, humanoid physique, it is capable of generating chilly winter winds measuring over 100 feet per second using the leafy fans in its hands. Shiftry draws inspiration from the Japanese Tengu mythology and acts as a fearsome protector of its deep forest habitat, often residing atop ancient trees. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it serves as the final evolution of the Seedot line.

## Evolution & Biology
Shiftry is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Nuzleaf when exposed to a **Leaf Stone**, making it an item-based evolution. Nuzleaf itself evolves from Seedot starting at **Level 14**. Shiftry belongs to the **Field (Ground)** and **Grass (Plant)** Egg Groups, requiring approximately 15 hatch cycles for breeding.
