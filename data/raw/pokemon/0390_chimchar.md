## Identity & Lore
Chimchar (Pokedex #390) is the Chimp Pokémon, a nimble Fire-type Starter introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). This agile, brown primate is physiologically adapted for verticality, known to scale sheer cliffs and live atop craggy mountains where it can nest safely. Its signature tail flame is fueled by gas produced in its belly; notably, this fire burns weakly when the Pokémon is ill and extinguishes completely when it sleeps to prevent accidental forest fires. While Chimchar itself does not possess alternate forms, it is the progenitor of the powerful **Infernape** line, a staple of competitive history known for its high speed and offensive versatility.
