## Identity & Lore
Quilava (Pokedex #156) is the Volcano Pokémon, first introduced in Generation II (Johto) as the evolution of the region's Fire-type starter. It is a long, slender quadruped with yellow and blue-cream coloration found primarily in grasslands. As its genus suggests, Quilava possesses distinct fire capabilities; it intimidates foes by turning its back to them, signaling that it is about to attack with the intense flames that erupt from the spots on its fur. Its fur is non-flammable, allowing it to withstand its own heat and fire attacks. While primarily known for evolving into the standard Typhlosion, in the ancient region of Hisui, Quilava is known to evolve into the Fire/Ghost-type Hisuian Typhlosion.

## Evolution & Biology
Quilava is part of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cyndaquil** starting at **Level 14**. It subsequently evolves into **Typhlosion** starting at **Level 36**. In the context of the Hisui region, this same evolution trigger results in the regional variant Hisuian Typhlosion. Quilava belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group and has a medium-slow growth rate.
