## Identity & Lore
Abra (Pokedex #063) is the Psi Pokémon, a pure Psychic-type introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This small, brown, upright creature is renowned for its immense mental power and elusive behavior. In the wild, Abra sleeps for up to 18 hours a day to conserve the telekinetic energy required to maintain its powers. Possessing the ability to read minds, it can sense aggressive intent or impending danger before it happens, instantaneously using **Teleport** to escape to safety. While physically frail, its mental capabilities are staggering for a base-stage Pokémon. It is the first stage of a powerful lineage that eventually leads to Alakazam, which is capable of achieving Mega Evolution.
