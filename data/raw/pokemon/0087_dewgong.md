## Identity & Lore
Dewgong (Pokedex #087) is the Sea Lion Pokémon, a streamlined Water/Ice-type entity first recorded in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its pristine, snow-white fur, this Pokémon is perfectly adapted to sub-zero environments, capable of swimming at a steady 8 knots even in the most intensely cold waters. Dewgong stores thermal energy within its body to survive freezing temperatures and is often found resting on icebergs or swimming through ice floes. Its graceful appearance in the water has historically led mariners to mistake it for a mermaid.
