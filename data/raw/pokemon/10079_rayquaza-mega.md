## Identity & Lore
Mega Rayquaza (Pokedex #10079) is the awe-inspiring Mega Evolved form of the legendary Rayquaza, known as the Sky High Pokémon. Originating from the Hoenn region in Generation III, this Dragon and Flying-type deity is said to have inhabited the Earth's ozone layer for hundreds of millions of years, acting as a celestial guardian and the master of the Weather Trio alongside Kyogre and Groudon. Measuring over 10 meters in length, its body is adorned with glowing, ethereal filaments that trail through the sky like ribbons of energy. Unlike most Pokémon that require a Mega Stone, Rayquaza achieves this state through its own internal power after learning its signature move, **Dragon Ascent**, which allows it to consume meteorites in the atmosphere to fuel its transformation. 

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 105, Attack 180, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 180, Sp. Def 100, Speed 115.
* **Archetype:** God-tier Mixed Sweeper. With astronomical offensive stats on both the physical and special sides, Mega Rayquaza is widely considered one of the most powerful entities in competitive history.
* **Type Matchups:** Under normal conditions, it has a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice** and standard weaknesses to Rock, Dragon, and Fairy. It naturally resists Fighting, Water, Bug, and Fire, with a 4x resistance to Grass and a total immunity to Ground.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive dual-offensive stats, its most devastating tools include **Dragon Ascent** (its signature Flying-type physical move), **Extreme Speed** (high-priority finishing), **Draco Meteor** (massive special-side nuke), and **Earthquake** (essential coverage against Steel and Rock types).
* **Abilities:** Delta Stream (This unique ability creates "Strong Winds" upon entry, which nullifies the weaknesses of the Flying type. This means Rock, Electric, and Ice-type moves only deal neutral damage to Mega Rayquaza instead of being super-effective, effectively removing its 4x Ice weakness).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Rayquaza represents a unique evolutionary pinnacle. While it does not belong to a traditional multi-stage family, it evolves from the base Rayquaza through a process called Mega Evolution. This transformation is triggered when Rayquaza, having learned the move **Dragon Ascent**, is sent into battle; it is the only Pokémon capable of Mega Evolving while also being able to hold a different item (such as a Life Orb or Choice Band) due to the lack of a required Mega Stone. Biologically, it is an atmospheric apex predator that feeds on water and particles high in the sky. It belongs to the **No Eggs** group and cannot be bred, reflecting its status as a singular, primordial force of nature.
