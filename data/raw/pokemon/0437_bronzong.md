## Identity & Lore
Bronzong (Pokedex #437) is the Bronze Bell Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A dual-type Steel/Psychic construct, it resembles an ancient dōtaku bell with a patina-green coloration, indicating significant age. Lore suggests that Bronzong was once worshipped as a bringer of plentiful harvests due to its ability to summon rain clouds by ringing its body like a bell. One individual caused a sensation after being excavated from a construction site following a 2,000-year sleep. Its body pattern is said to contain a mysterious power, and it possesses a hollow structure that reverberates with a deep, gong-like sound.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 67, Attack 89, Defense 116, Sp. Atk 79, Sp. Def 116, Speed 33.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Wall / Trick Room Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Steel/Psychic type, it is traditionally **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark**. However, its abilities drastically alter these vulnerabilities (see below). It **resists Normal, Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy** types and is **immune to Poison**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its incredibly low Speed and high defenses, key moves include **Gyro Ball** (dealing massive damage based on being slower than the target), **Body Press** (calculating damage using its high Defense stat), **Trick Room** (turning its low speed into an advantage by moving first), and **Stealth Rock** (setting entry hazards).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Levitate:** Grants full immunity to Ground-type moves and Spikes, effectively removing one of its primary weaknesses.
    *   **Heatproof:** Halves the damage taken from Fire-type moves and burn damage, neutralizing a major weakness.
    *   **Heavy Metal (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon's weight, which increases damage dealt by moves like Heavy Slam.

## Evolution & Biology
Bronzong is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bronzor** starting at **Level 33**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group. As a genderless inorganic Pokémon, it does not reproduce in the traditional sense but appears to be crafted or animated through ancient energy.
