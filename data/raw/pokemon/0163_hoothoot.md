## Identity & Lore
Hoothoot (Pokedex #163) is the Owl Pokémon, a dual-type Normal/Flying avian introduced in Generation II (Johto). Primarily inhabiting forests, this small, brown Pokémon is renowned for its internal organ that senses the earth's rotation, allowing it to keep perfect time and tilt its head rhythmically like a clock. Hoothoot always stands on one foot, switching legs so rapidly that the movement is invisible to the naked eye. While it possesses significant latent psychic potential, often utilizing hypnosis and confusion tactics in the wild, it retains the Normal typing until evolution.
