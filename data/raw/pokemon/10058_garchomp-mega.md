## Identity & Lore
Mega Garchomp (Pokedex #445) is the Mega Evolved form of the Mach Pokémon, a dual-type Dragon and Ground pseudo-legendary originally discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). While its base form is famous for flying at sonic speeds like a jet plane, the infusion of Mega Evolution energy causes its wings to melt and reform into brutal, scythe-like blades. This transformation prioritizes raw power over its previous aerodynamic grace, turning its arms into jagged weapons that can tear through armor. As a blue, bipedal draconic predator, Mega Garchomp is a desert-dwelling apex stalker that often thrives in volcanic or arid mountainous terrain. While it does not possess a Gigantamax form, its status as a Mega Evolution makes it one of the most formidable combatants in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 108, Attack 170, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 120, Sp. Def 95, Speed 92.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker. Mega Garchomp trades a portion of its base form's Speed for overwhelming physical and special offensive pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Dragon and Fairy**, and possesses a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. Conversely, it **resists Poison, Rock, and Fire**, and maintains a total **immunity to Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive 170 Base Attack and respectable Special Attack, Mega Garchomp excels with high-impact STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves. Key selections include **Earthquake** and **Outrage** (or **Dragon Claw**) for physical destruction, **Stone Edge** for critical coverage against Flying types, and **Swords Dance** to reach terrifying levels of physical power. It can also effectively run **Draco Meteor** or **Fire Blast** to surprise physical walls.
* **Abilities:** Sand Force (Increases the power of Ground, Rock, and Steel-type moves by 30% during a sandstorm). This makes Mega Garchomp a premier choice for "Sand Stream" teams, where its boosted Earthquake and Stone Edge can OHKO most opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Garchomp is the final, temporary stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Gible**, which evolves into **Gabite** starting at Level 24, and finally into **Garchomp** at Level 48. The transition to Mega Garchomp is achieved only in battle when Garchomp holds a **Garchompite** Mega Stone. Biologically, it is part of the **Monster and Dragon** Egg Groups and has a slow growth rate, reflecting the intensive training required to master its power. Despite its fierce appearance, it is known to be protective of its territory, often found in deep caverns or sand-swept plains where its Ground-type affinity gives it a home-field advantage.
