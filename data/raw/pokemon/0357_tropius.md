## Identity & Lore
Tropius (Pokedex #357) is the Fruit Pokémon, a massive, quadrupedal creature resembling a sauropod dinosaur that debuted in Generation III (Hoenn). This dual-type Grass/Flying Pokémon is easily recognized by the broad, palm-like leaves sprouting from its back, which it uses to fly, and the distinct bunches of yellow fruit growing around its neck. According to lore, Tropius developed this fruit-bearing capability due to its obsessive consumption of fruit; these bunches are sweet, delicious, and extremely popular with children. It primarily inhabits tropical jungles and forests where it can blend in with the canopy. While it resembles a dinosaur, its docile nature and food-sharing behavior make it a gentle giant in the Pokémon world.

## Evolution & Biology
Tropius is a standalone species and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Plant** Egg Groups. Because it does not evolve, hatchlings emerge fully formed, though they require significant time to mature, indicated by a relatively high hatch counter. Its biological traits combine reptilian physiology with botanical characteristics, allowing it to photosynthesize energy similar to a plant while retaining the mobility of a flying beast.
