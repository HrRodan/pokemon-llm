## Identity & Lore
Toxel (Pokedex #848) is the Baby Pokémon, a unique dual-type Electric/Poison species first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). This small, purple bipedal Pokémon is characterized by its perpetually grumpy expression and a white protrusion on its chest that resembles a bib or lightning bolt. Biologically, Toxel stores toxins in an internal poison sac and secretes them through its skin; touching it results in a sharp, tingling sensation. While physically fragile, it possesses massive evolutionary potential, eventually maturing into the punk-rock-inspired Toxtricity. Toxtricity is famous for having two distinct forms—Amped and Low Key—based on its personality (Nature), and it is capable of undergoing Gigantamaxing to become a mountain-sized guitarist of destruction.

## Evolution & Biology
Toxel is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Toxtricity** starting at **Level 30**. This evolution is unique in the Pokémon world as the resulting form is dictated by Toxel's Nature: Natures such as Adamant, Brave, or Rash produce the **Amped Form**, while Natures like Modest, Calm, or Timid result in the **Low Key Form**. Classified as a "Baby Pokémon," Toxel belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot breed in its current state. Breeders must evolve it into Toxtricity to produce more of the species. It has a medium-slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 25, requiring significant travel to hatch from an egg.
