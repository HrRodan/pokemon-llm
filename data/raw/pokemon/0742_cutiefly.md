## Identity & Lore
Cutiefly (#742) is the Bee Fly Pokémon, a diminutive and vibrant species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This tiny, yellow-colored Pokémon is distinguished by its translucent wings and a long proboscis used for feeding on nectar and pollen. Cutiefly possesses the remarkable ability to sense the auras of living things, which it uses to identify which flowers are on the verge of blooming. While Cutiefly itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Ribombee, was famously featured as a powerful Totem Pokémon in the Alola trials. In the wild, it is frequently found in meadows and fields, often carrying **Honey** which it gathers during its foraging.

    * **Honey Gather:** Allows the Pokémon to find Honey after a battle, reflecting its natural foraging behavior.
    * **Shield Dust:** A potent competitive ability that blocks the secondary effects of damaging moves (e.g., preventing flinching from Fake Out or paralysis from Thunderbolt).
    * **Sweet Veil (Hidden Ability):** Prevents Cutiefly and its allies from falling asleep, making it a strong counter to "Spore" or "Sleep Powder" strategies in VGC and Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Cutiefly is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Ribombee** when it reaches **Level 25**. Biologically, it is a member of the **Bug and Fairy Egg Groups**, with a relatively fast hatching cycle (20 hatch counters). Its aura-reading capabilities are so sensitive that it can detect the emotions of people and other Pokémon; it is said that Cutiefly will gather around individuals who are particularly happy or excited, as their aura resembles a flower in full bloom. Despite its fragile appearance, it is a highly mobile flyer capable of using moves like **Tailwind** and **U-turn** to maintain momentum on the battlefield.
