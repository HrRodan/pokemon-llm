## Identity & Lore
Mime Jr. (Pokedex #439) is the Mime Pokémon, a dual-type Psychic/Fairy baby Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Small, pink, and humanoid, it is famous for its compulsive behavior of mimicking the movements of opponents. This mimicry serves a defensive purpose; once a foe is mimicked, they reportedly cannot take their eyes off Mime Jr., confusing them and creating an opening for escape. While it appears harmless, it possesses significant magical potential as the pre-evolved form of the barrier-creating Mr. Mime.
