## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Flapple (Pokedex #10216) is the towering, Galar-native form of the Apple Wing Pokémon. Emerging from Generation VIII (Galar), this specific form occurs when a Flapple undergoes Gigantamaxing, a phenomenon where it swells to a height of 24 meters and becomes encased in a massive, overflowing vessel of sweet nectar. While standard Flapple are known for evolving after consuming a sour Tart Apple—developing acidic cheeks capable of causing chemical burns—the Gigantamax form concentrates this power into a sticky, overwhelming force. In this state, it resembles its counterpart, Gigantamax Appletun, but retains its distinct aggressive nature. Beyond this Gigantamax state, Flapple is part of a complex evolutionary family that recently expanded to include Dipplin and the multi-headed Hydrapple found in the Kitakami and Blueberry Academy regions.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 110, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 60, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, Dragon, and Fairy**, with a catastrophic **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. It provides excellent resistances to Ground, Water, Electric, and a **double resistance (4x) to Grass**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high physical Attack, Flapple-Gmax utilizes **Grav Apple** (its signature move which lowers the target's Defense), **Outrage** for massive STAB damage, **Dragon Dance** to fix its middling Speed, and **Dual Wingbeat** for coverage and breaking Focus Sashes. In its Gigantamax form, its Grass-type moves transform into **G-Max Tartness**, which deals damage and reduces the opponent's evasiveness.
* **Abilities:** **Ripen** (doubles the effect of held Berries, making it incredibly tanky or offensive depending on the fruit), **Gluttony** (allows the Pokémon to eat a held Berry at 50% HP instead of 25%), and the Hidden Ability **Hustle** (boosts Attack power by 50% at the cost of 20% accuracy, turning Flapple into a high-risk, high-reward glass cannon).

## Evolution & Biology
Flapple-Gmax is the pinnacle of a multi-stage evolutionary line starting with Applin. The biology of this species is unique; an Applin evolves into Flapple specifically when exposed to a **Tart Apple**. This is a divergent path, as exposing an Applin to a Sweet Apple results in Appletun, while a Syrupy Apple leads to Dipplin. Flapple belongs to the **Grass (Plant)** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. Its life cycle is inextricably linked to the apples it inhabits, using the fruit's skin as wings for flight and its fermented juices as a potent weapon against predators in the forest canopies of Galar.
