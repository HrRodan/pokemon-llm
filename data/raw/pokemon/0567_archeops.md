## Identity & Lore
Archeops (Pokedex #567) is the First Bird Pokémon, a prehistoric avian species originally resurrected from a Plume Fossil. Introduced in Generation V (Unova), this ancient Rock/Flying-type is characterized by its vibrant yellow, blue, and red plumage and its reptilian features, reflecting its status as an evolutionary link between dinosaurs and modern birds. Despite its ability to fly, flavor text suggests it is more adept at running, requiring a significant head start on the ground to achieve lift-off. Archeops are highly intelligent and social predators that worked in coordinated packs to hunt prey in the distant past. While it currently possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its raw power is often compared to that of Minor Legendaries, though its prehistoric nature leaves it with a distinct biological disadvantage in prolonged combat.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 140, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 112, Sp. Def 65, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Glass Cannon / Mixed Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Electric, Ice, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Bug, and Flying**, and possesses a vital **Immunity to Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive base 140 Attack and 110 Speed, Archeops excels with high-impact STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves and momentum-shifting utility. Key moves include **Acrobatics** (which doubles in power if the user has no held item), **Stone Edge** for raw Rock-type damage, **Earthquake** for essential coverage against Steel and Electric types, and **U-turn** to pivot out of dangerous matchups before its HP drops.
* **Abilities:** Defeatist (The Pokémon's Attack and Special Attack stats are halved when its HP falls to 50% or less). This ability is a significant tactical hurdle, forcing trainers to prioritize "One-Hit Knockouts" (OHKOs) or use items like Sitrus Berries to maintain health.

## Evolution & Biology
Archeops is the second and final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Archen** starting at **Level 37**. As a resurrected Fossil Pokémon, its biology is unique, placing it within the **Flying** and **Water 3** Egg Groups. It has a relatively slow growth rate but yields a high base experience of 177 upon defeat. Its physical structure, categorized by its "wings" shape, allows it to learn a diverse array of moves ranging from ancient powers like **Ancient Power** and **Meteor Beam** to modern tactical maneuvers like **Tailwind**, **Taunt**, and **Stealth Rock**. Owners of Archeops must manage its high Hatch Counter (30) when breeding and account for its frantic, high-pressure fighting style necessitated by its Defeatist trait.
