## Identity & Lore
Shinx (Pokedex #403) is the Flash Pokémon, a pure Electric-type entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). This quadrupedal, blue feline is characterized by the star-shaped pattern on the tip of its tail and its ability to generate electricity through muscle contractions. Biologically, Shinx utilizes a dazzling defense mechanism; when it senses danger, its fur glows brightly to momentarily blind enemies, allowing it to flee. It is often found in grassy savannas and is the base form of the formidable Luxray line. While Shinx does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its evolutionary line is highly regarded for its intimidating presence and physical offensive capabilities.

## Evolution & Biology
Shinx is part of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Luxio** starting at **Level 15**, and subsequently evolves into **Luxray** starting at **Level 30**. This relatively low-level evolution curve makes it a staple for trainers early in their journey. Shinx belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
