## Identity & Lore
Snivy (Pokedex #495) is the Grass Snake Pokémon, serving as the Grass-type Starter for the **Generation V (Unova)** region. A highly intelligent and calm creature, Snivy is characterized by its sleek, green appearance and upright posture. Its biology is heavily dependent on photosynthesis; when exposed to abundant sunlight, its movements become significantly swifter. Unlike many other grass starters that rely on spores or powders, Snivy utilizes vines and sharp leaves for combat, projecting an air of nobility and composure. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its final evolution, Serperior, is a formidable competitive threat due to its unique ability mechanics.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 45, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 55, Speed 63.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility / Disruptor.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug, and Poison**. It **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Speed and disruptive potential, key moves include **Leaf Storm** (massive damage), **Giga Drain** (sustain), **Glare** (paralysis support to cripple faster threats), and **Leech Seed** (passive damage and healing).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Overgrow:** Powers up Grass-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Contrary (Hidden Ability):** Inverts stat changes. This is the cornerstone of its viability, turning moves that lower stats (like **Leaf Storm**) into moves that sharply boost Special Attack instead.

## Evolution & Biology
Snivy is part of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Servine** starting at **Level 17**, which then evolves into the regal **Serperior** starting at **Level 36**. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** and **Grass (Plant)** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
