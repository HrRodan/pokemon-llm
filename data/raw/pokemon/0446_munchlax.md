## Identity & Lore
Munchlax (Pokedex #446) is the Big Eater Pokémon, a voracious Normal-type creature introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Visually, it appears as a teal-colored, small bear-like entity with a cream spot on its chest. True to its classification, Munchlax possesses an insatiable metabolism, compelling it to wolf down its own weight in food—roughly **105.0 kg**—every single day. It swallows its meals whole with almost no chewing and often hides food under its long fur to consume later. Although it is a **Baby Pokémon**, its sheer density makes it surprisingly heavy. In the Sinnoh region, it is famously elusive, historically found only by slathering Honey on sweet-smelling trees.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 135, Attack 85, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 85, Speed 5.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Eviolite Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** types. As a Normal-type, it possesses a valuable **immunity to Ghost** attacks but has no natural resistances. However, the **Thick Fat** ability grants it pseudo-resistances to Fire and Ice moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high HP and decent Attack (while ignoring its negligible Special Attack), key moves include **Body Slam** (for STAB and paralysis utility), **Earthquake** (for coverage against Rock and Steel types), **Curse** (to boost Attack and Defense at the cost of its already low Speed), and **Rest** (for complete recovery).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pickup:** Allows the Pokémon to find items after battle or consume an opponent's used item during combat.
    *   **Thick Fat:** Halves the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves, significantly improving its defensive profile.
    *   **Gluttony (Hidden):** Encourage the Pokémon to consume a held Berry at 50% HP rather than the usual 25%, enabling advanced tactics with items like the Figy Berry.

## Evolution & Biology
Munchlax is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Snorlax** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (220 or higher). As a Baby Pokémon belonging to the **No-Eggs** group, Munchlax cannot breed; however, it can be obtained by breeding a Snorlax holding a **Full Incense**. If the parent does not hold the incense, the egg will produce a Snorlax instead.
