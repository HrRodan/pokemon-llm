## Identity & Lore
Aegislash (Pokedex #681) is the Royal Sword Pokémon and a central figure in the history of the Kalos region (Generation VI). This spectral entity resembles a sentient golden sword and a thick, ornate shield, a design that reflects its long history of attending generations of kings. According to legend, Aegislash possesses the terrifying ability to detect innate leadership qualities; those it recognizes are said to be destined for the throne, though the Pokémon also uses its spectral power to manipulate and control the minds of both humans and Pokémon alike. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique physiological ability to transition between "Shield Forme" and "Blade Forme" makes it one of the most mechanically complex entities in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 50, Defense 140, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 140, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Stance-Shifting Defensive Pivot / Mixed Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Steel/Ghost-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses a remarkable defensive profile, boasting a **Double Resistance (4x) to Bug** and resistances to **Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. Additionally, it is **immune to Normal, Fighting, and Poison** types.
* **Move Selection:** Aegislash relies on its ability to swap its defensive and offensive stats. Key moves that capitalize on its versatility include **King's Shield** (its signature move for returning to Shield Forme), **Shadow Ball** (powerful special Ghost STAB), **Flash Cannon** (reliable special Steel STAB), and **Sacred Sword** (a physical move that ignores the target's stat changes).
* **Abilities:** Stance Change (The Pokémon changes its form to Blade Forme when it uses an attacking move, and changes to Shield Forme when it uses King's Shield. This effectively swaps its Base 140 Defense/Special Defense with its Base 140 Attack/Special Attack mid-combat).

## Evolution & Biology
Aegislash is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, originating from the spirit of a departed human inhabiting an ancient sword. It begins as **Honedge**, which evolves into the dual-wielding **Doublade** starting at Level 35. The final transition into Aegislash occurs only when Doublade is exposed to a **Dusk Stone**. Biologically, Aegislash belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and despite its metallic appearance, it is a highly intelligent spectral predator. Its life cycle is deeply intertwined with human conflict, often appearing on battlefields where it can drain the life force of warriors.
