## Identity & Lore
Yamper (#835) is the Puppy Pokémon, a quadrupedal Electric-type recognized for its vibrant yellow fur and playful disposition. First discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII, this Pokémon has become a staple of Galarian culture, widely utilized as a dedicated herding dog for Wooloo flocks. Yamper possesses an organ in its body that generates electricity, but it cannot store it efficiently; consequently, it is often seen running around with sparks flying from the base of its tail. Its design is heavily inspired by the Corgi, reflecting its role in a region based on the United Kingdom. While Yamper does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form itself, its evolved form, Boltund, is a prominent competitive threat in lower tiers, and Yamper remains a fan favorite for its unique "Ball Fetch" behavior, reflecting its obsession with chasing moving objects.

## Evolution & Biology
Yamper is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Boltund** starting at **Level 25**. Biologically, Yamper is driven by a gluttonous appetite, often only helping humans in exchange for treats. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and with a hatch counter of 20, it is relatively easy for breeders to produce. Its "Fast" growth rate allows it to reach its evolved state quickly, making it an ideal companion for trainers beginning their journey through the Galar region.
