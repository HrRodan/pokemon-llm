## Identity & Lore
Pheromosa (Pokedex #795) is the Lissome Pokémon, a powerful and mysterious entity categorized as an Ultra Beast, originally discovered in the Alola region (Generation VII). Designated by the International Police as UB-02 Beauty, Pheromosa is a lithe, feminine humanoid creature primarily white in color, possessing long, delicate antennae and a veil-like anatomical structure. According to Alolan records, it hails from the Ultra Desert through an Ultra Wormhole. Despite its delicate appearance, it is remarkably dangerous; flavor text notes it has been spotted running across the land at terrific speeds, often exceeding 120 mph. Pheromosa possesses a profound sense of disgust toward the Pokémon world, viewing everything within it as unclean and refusing to touch anything if possible. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as an Ultra Beast places it among the most elite and otherworldly combatants in the Pokémon multiverse.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 71, Attack 137, Defense 37, Sp. Atk 137, Sp. Def 37, Speed 151.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Glass Cannon. Pheromosa is the definition of a "Glass Cannon," possessing elite offensive stats and incredible Speed, but virtually non-existent defensive capabilities.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Psychic, and Fairy**, and has a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Flying**. It resists **Bug, Fighting, Grass, Ground, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its equal 137 Base Attack and Special Attack, Pheromosa excels with a mixed movepool. Key moves include **High Jump Kick** (massive STAB physical damage), **Bug Buzz** (reliable special STAB), **Ice Beam** (essential coverage for Flying and Ground types), and **U-turn** (to maintain momentum and escape before being hit).
* **Abilities:** Beast Boost (The signature ability of Ultra Beasts; it increases Pheromosa's highest raw stat—typically Speed or Attack—by one stage every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to snowball into an unstoppable sweeper).

## Evolution & Biology
Pheromosa is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. As an Ultra Beast, it belongs to the **No-eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is characterized by extreme efficiency of movement; its thin limbs are capable of sudden, explosive power, allowing it to dodge attacks as if it were dancing. Biologically, it is extremely sensitive to its environment, often displaying a clean-freak personality that suggests its home dimension, the Ultra Desert, possesses vastly different atmospheric or hygienic conditions than the Alola region.
