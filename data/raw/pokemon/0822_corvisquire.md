## Identity & Lore
Corvisquire (Pokedex #822) is the Raven Pokémon, a sleek blue avian first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Known for its remarkable intelligence, Corvisquire is far more than a simple bird of prey; it is smart enough to utilize tools during combat, often flinging rocks at adversaries or using lengths of rope to entangle and immobilize its enemies. This cognitive complexity sets it apart from other avian species, reflecting its progression toward its final armored form. While Corvisquire itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it eventually evolves into Corviknight, which is famous for its massive and formidable Gigantamax state used extensively in the Galar Taxi service and competitive arenas.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 67, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 43, Sp. Def 55, Speed 77.
* **Archetype:** Middle-Stage Physical Pivot. With its highest stats in Speed and Attack, Corvisquire functions best as a mobile physical attacker that can support its team before evolving into a more defensive powerhouse.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Flying-type, it is **weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It **resists Grass, Fighting, and Bug**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical Attack stat and utility, key moves include **Brave Bird** for high-impact STAB damage, **Drill Peck** for consistent aerial offense, **U-turn** for pivoting out of unfavorable matchups, and **Tailwind** to provide essential speed control for the rest of the party.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Keen Eye:** Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its accuracy and allows it to ignore any evasiveness boosts the target may have.
    * **Unnerve:** Makes the opponent too nervous to eat its held Berry, disrupting various recovery or stat-boosting strategies.
    * **Big Pecks (Hidden Ability):** Protects the Pokémon from having its Defense stat lowered, ensuring its physical durability remains intact against debuffing moves like Leer or Screech.

## Evolution & Biology
Corvisquire is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Rookidee** starting at **Level 18**. After gaining sufficient combat experience, it evolves into the formidable Steel/Flying-type **Corviknight** at **Level 38**. Biologically, Corvisquire is highly adaptable and belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group. It has a hatch counter of 15, making it relatively quick to breed for trainers looking for specific natures or hidden abilities. Its medium-slow growth rate suggests it requires dedicated training to reach its full potential as the "Sky Knight" of the Galar region.
