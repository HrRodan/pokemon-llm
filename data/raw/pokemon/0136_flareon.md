## Identity & Lore
Flareon (Pokedex #136) is the Flame Pokémon, a Fire-type introduced in Generation I (Kanto). It is one of the eight possible evolutions of Eevee, distinguished by its reddish-orange fur and a large, fluffy yellow collar and tail. Biologically, Flareon possesses an internal flame sac that functions like a furnace, allowing it to store thermal energy and raise its body temperature to over 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit. To prevent overheating during battle, it fluffs out its collar to release excess heat into the air. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a member of the iconic "Eeveelution" family, often found in urban areas or warm climates.
