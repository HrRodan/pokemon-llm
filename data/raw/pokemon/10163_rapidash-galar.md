## Identity & Lore
Galarian Rapidash (Pokedex #10163) is the Unique Horn Pokémon, a majestic regional variant of the Fire Horse Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto region. While its traditional form is a Fire-type, this variant adapted to the unique ecology of the Galar region (Generation VIII), specifically the deep, bioluminescent woods of Glimwood Tangle. Its mane, now a flowing aura of pastel purple and teal, stores psychic power that it can release through its horn. Very competitive by nature, this Pokémon will chase anything that moves fast in the hopes of racing it. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or a Gigantamax form, Galarian Rapidash is celebrated as a symbol of grace and ferocity in the Galar region, often acting as a forest guardian.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Rapidash is the final part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Galarian Ponyta** upon reaching **Level 40**. Biologically, it is a quadruped with a long, pearlescent horn that is said to have healing properties. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** egg group. Its physiology allows it to gallop at speeds exceeding 150 mph, with its hooves barely touching the ground as it sprints through grasslands and forest clearings. Unlike its Kantonian ancestor, its power is focused internally through its horn rather than externally through flames.
