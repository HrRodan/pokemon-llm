## Identity & Lore
Drapion (Pokedex #452) is the Ogre Scorpion Pokémon, a formidable Poison/Dark-type native to the **Sinnoh** region (Generation IV). Known for its purple, armor-like exoskeleton, this Pokémon possesses immense physical strength in its upper body, capable of reducing a car to scrap metal with its clawed arms. While it resembles a scorpion, it has the unique ability to rotate its head 180 degrees to track prey. Drapion is aggressive and relies on its raw power and the potent toxins released from the tips of its claws to subdue opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Drapion is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Skorupi** upon reaching **Level 40**. Notably, upon evolution, it sheds Skorupi's Bug typing to become a Dark type, significantly altering its defensive profile. It belongs to the **Bug** and **Water 3** Egg Groups.
