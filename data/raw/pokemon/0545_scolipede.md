## Identity & Lore
Scolipede (Pokedex #545) is the Megapede Pokémon, a massive and predatory Bug/Poison-type introduced in Generation V (Unova). Standing at an intimidating 2.5 meters, this centipede-like creature is known for its vibrant red-and-purple segmented body and aggressive temperament. As the final evolution of the Venipede line, Scolipede is a relentless hunter that uses its quick movements and sharp horns to pin down and poison its prey. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its sheer size and speed make it a dominant force in forest and woodland ecosystems. Its flavor text highlights its brutal efficiency, noting that it attacks relentlessly with its horns until it prevails over any foe that enters its territory.

## Evolution & Biology
Scolipede is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The process begins with **Venipede**, which evolves into the shell-like **Whirlipede** starting at Level 22. Whirlipede finally evolves into **Scolipede** upon reaching Level 30. Biologically, Scolipede is a heavyweight insectoid weighing 200.5 kg, often found carrying a **Poison Barb** or **Pecha Berry** in the wild. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a medium-slow growth rate. Despite its bulky, armored appearance, its biology is optimized for extreme bursts of speed, a trait it passes down through its lineage, making it a favorite for trainers looking for a fast-acting offensive lead.
