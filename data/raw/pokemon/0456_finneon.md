## Identity & Lore
Finneon (Pokedex #456) is the Wing Fish Pokémon, first introduced in Generation IV within the **Sinnoh** region. Often nicknamed the "Beautifly of the Sea" due to its butterfly-like pectoral fins, this aquatic Pokémon is renowned for its **bioluminescence**. Finneon absorbs sunlight through its pink fascia during the day, allowing the patterns on its tail fins to shine vividly when darkness arrives. These dual tail fins flutter like wings, creating a swimming motion that resembles flying. While generally docile, its glowing nature makes it visible to predators in the deep sea, leading it to use its flashing lights to confuse enemies or communicate with others of its kind. It does not possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 49, Attack 49, Defense 56, Sp. Atk 49, Sp. Def 61, Speed 66.
* **Archetype:** Fast Utility Pivot / Little Cup Support.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water-type**, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Due to its equal offensive stats but access to high-utility special moves, an optimal set focuses on disruption and pivoting. Key moves include **Scald** (for STAB and burn chance), **U-turn** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups), **Defog** (to clear entry hazards), and **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Grass types). **Tailwind** is also a viable option for speed control.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, making it a viable sweeper in weather teams.
    *   **Storm Drain:** Draws in all Water-type moves used by opponents to itself and boosts its Sp. Atk by one stage, granting it an immunity to Water attacks.
    *   **Water Veil (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by a burn, ensuring its Attack stat is not halved (though less critical for Special sets).

## Evolution & Biology
Finneon is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Lumineon** when it reaches **Level 31**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group, sharing genetic compatibility with fish-like Pokémon such as Goldeen and Magikarp. In the wild, Finneon is often hunted by bird Pokémon like Wingull due to its visibility near the water's surface. It can sometimes be found holding a **Rindo Berry** to mitigate damage from Grass-type predators.
