## Identity & Lore
Hoppip (Pokedex #187) is the Cottonweed Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). A dual-type Grass/Flying entity, Hoppip is characterized by its exceedingly light weight and pink, spherical body topped with rotating leaves. To prevent being blown away by strong gusts, these Pokémon exhibit a communal behavior of gathering in clusters and linking their leaves together to anchor themselves. While they are prone to drifting helplessly in high winds, they thrive in grassland habitats where they can enjoy gentle breezes. Hoppip serves as the initial stage of a wind-dependent evolutionary line.
