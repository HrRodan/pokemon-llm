## Identity & Lore
Claydol (Pokédex #344) is the Clay Doll Pokémon, a dual-type Ground/Psychic construct introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). According to lore, this artificial lifeform originated from mud dolls crafted by primitive humans over 20,000 years ago, which were subsequently brought to life by exposure to a mysterious ray. Resembling an ancient Dogū figurine, Claydol possesses a black body with multiple eyes and detached arms that float independently via telekinesis. It never sleeps and levitates constantly to move, often inhabiting rough terrains or ancient ruins. While it has no known biological gender, it is a fully autonomous being capable of firing beams from its hand-like appendages.
