## Identity & Lore
Probopass (Pokedex #476) is the Compass Pokémon, a dual-type Rock/Steel entity originally discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). It is a massive, magnetic organism that radiates a strong magnetic field, allowing it to freely control three small units called "Mini-Noses" as satellites. These units can strike opponents from three directions simultaneously. Its body acts as a powerful magnet, with its prominent nose always pointing north. Its appearance, characterized by a large red nose and iron filings resembling a mustache, creates a distinct silhouette. While it has no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biological functions are deeply tied to strong electromagnetic fields.

    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing it can survive a single devastating attack.

## Evolution & Biology
Probopass is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Nosepass** when exposed to a special magnetic field (leveling up in locations such as Mt. Coronet, Chargestone Cave, or Vast Poni Canyon) or, in recent findings, when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group. Its biology consists of a main body and independent "Mini-Noses" that it directs via magnetic waves to hunt prey or battle enemies.
