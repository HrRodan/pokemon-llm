## Identity & Lore
Avalugg (#713) is the Iceberg Pokémon, a massive quadrupedal creature originally discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Resembling a gargantuan, flat-topped glacier or an ice-clad aircraft carrier, its body is composed of ice so dense it is often compared to the hardness of steel. In its natural habitat, several Bergmite may be seen huddling on its back, making it appear like a floating island of frost. While the standard form is a pure Ice-type, a distinct regional variant known as **Hisuian Avalugg** exists in the ancient Hisui region, possessing a dual Ice/Rock typing and a massive serrated jaw of ice. Despite its cumbersome frame and slow movement, it is a relentless force capable of crushing anything in its path.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 117, Defense 184, Sp. Atk 44, Sp. Def 46, Speed 28.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Defensive Wall.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, and Fire**. It **resists Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Avalugg excels by utilizing its massive Defense and respectable Attack. Key moves in its arsenal include **Body Press** (which calculates damage using its 184 Defense stat), **Icicle Crash** (for heavy physical STAB damage), **Recover** (to maintain its longevity as a wall), and **Rapid Spin** (to clear entry hazards like Stealth Rock).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused, ensuring it never hits itself in its own massive bulk.
    * **Ice Body:** Gradually regains HP during Snow or Hail, synergizing perfectly with defensive playstyles.
    * **Sturdy (Hidden Ability):** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full health, a vital safeguard against powerful Special Fire or Fighting-type attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Avalugg is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bergmite** once it reaches **Level 37**. Biologically, it is built for endurance in extreme sub-zero temperatures, often found in glacial environments. It belongs to both the **Monster and Mineral** Egg Groups, and while it is slow to hatch (Hatch Counter: 20), its presence on a team provides a nearly unbreakable physical backbone. Its flat back is not just for defense; it often serves as a mobile platform for smaller Ice-type Pokémon in the wild.
