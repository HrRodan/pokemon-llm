## Identity & Lore
Zarude (Pokedex #893) is the Rogue Monkey Pokémon, a Mythical species first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Deep within the dense canopies of the Forest of Okoya, these creatures live in large, territorial packs that are so notoriously aggressive that other Pokémon flee at the mere sight of them. It is characterized by its dark, lithe body and the prehensile vines it can grow at will from its wrists, neck, and the soles of its feet. These vines are versatile, used for swinging through trees, ensnaring prey, or even providing nutrients to the forest soil. While most Zarude are hostile, a unique variant known as **Dada Zarude** is celebrated in lore for its paternal instincts, famously wearing a pink tattered cape reminiscent of a Celebi. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Mythical Pokémon grants it immense presence in both competitive circles and cinematic history.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 105, Attack 120, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 95, Speed 105.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Sweeper. With a high Attack stat and impressive natural bulk, Zarude functions as a durable offensive threat that can outspeed many mid-tier opponents.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Dark/Grass-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Fairy, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Ice**, and carries a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug**. Conversely, it provides vital resistances to Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, Dark, and Ghost, and is completely **immune to Psychic-type** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Zarude excels when utilizing high-powered physical maneuvers and its unique signature utility. Key moves include **Power Whip** for massive Grass-type damage, **Darkest Lariat** to bypass an opponent's defensive stat changes, **Jungle Healing** for simultaneous HP recovery and status curing for itself and allies, and **U-turn** to maintain offensive momentum.
* **Abilities:** **Leaf Guard** (Its primary ability prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by non-volatile status conditions like burn, paralysis, or sleep while the weather is Harsh Sunlight).

## Evolution & Biology
Zarude is a singular, non-evolving Mythical Pokémon and is not part of any evolutionary chain. Biologically, it is built for the jungle, with its "green" color classification reflecting its symbiotic relationship with plant life. It belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. In the wild, it is known for its "Slow" growth rate, reflecting the long periods required for a Rogue Monkey to master its vine-manipulation techniques. Its capture rate is exceptionally low at 3, making it one of the most difficult Pokémon to secure outside of special distribution events.
