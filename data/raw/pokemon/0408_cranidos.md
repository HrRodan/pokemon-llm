## Identity & Lore
Cranidos (Pokedex #408) is the Head Butt Pokémon, a prehistoric creature originally native to the jungles of the **Sinnoh** region (Generation IV). Revived from the **Skull Fossil** using modern technology, this Pokémon lived approximately 100 million years ago. Resembling a small Pachycephalosaurus, Cranidos is characterized by its blue scales and an exceptionally thick, dome-shaped skull which is said to be as hard as iron. It uses this head as its primary weapon, snapping trees with headbutts to reach berries or defend itself. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a key component of fossil-themed teams.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 67, Attack 125, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 30, Speed 58.
*   **Archetype:** **Physical Wallbreaker / Glass Cannon**. Cranidos possesses an absurdly high Attack stat for an unevolved Pokémon (higher than many fully evolved species), making it a terrifying threat in Little Cup (LC) formats, though its defenses are paper-thin.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Rock** type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Grass**. It **resists Normal, Flying, Bug, Fire, and Poison**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 125 Attack, Cranidos functions best with high-power physical attacks and speed control. Key moves include **Head Smash** (massive STAB damage with recoil), **Earthquake** (for coverage against Steel and Rock types), **Zen Headbutt** (coverage against Fighting types), and **Rock Polish** (to remedy its middling Speed).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Mold Breaker:** Moves can be used on the target regardless of its Abilities (e.g., hitting a Levitating Pokémon with Earthquake).
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden):** Removes additional effects to increase the power of moves by 30%. This synergizes well with moves like Zen Headbutt or Rock Slide.

## Evolution & Biology
Cranidos is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Rampardos** starting at **Level 30**. Due to its ancient origins, it is often found in the **Monster** Egg Group. To obtain a Cranidos in most regions, a trainer must first locate a **Skull Fossil** and bring it to a scientific research facility for regeneration.
