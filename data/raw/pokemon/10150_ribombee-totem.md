## Identity & Lore
Totem Ribombee (Pokedex #10150) is the Bee Fly Pokémon, a specialized and significantly larger variant of the standard Ribombee found in the Alola region (Generation VII). This specific Totem form is famously encountered as the guardian of the trial at Vast Poni Canyon in *Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon*. It is recognized by its vibrant yellow coloration, translucent wings, and a long, needle-like proboscis used to collect nectar and pollen. 

Ribombee is a master of "Pollen Puffs," versatile spheres crafted from pollen and nectar; some are nutritious snacks used to alleviate exhaustion, while others are highly volatile and used as projectiles in combat. These puffs can also induce paralysis or dizziness in foes. Despite its delicate appearance, Ribombee is remarkably hardy and can fly through rain by expertly weaving between raindrops. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Totem Pokémon grants it a shimmering aura that significantly boosts its attributes at the start of battle.

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Ribombee is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cutiefly** starting at **Level 25**. Unlike the standard Ribombee, which is a mere 0.2 meters tall, the Totem variant grows to a height of 0.4 meters, doubling its stature to intimidate challengers.

Biologically, it is a highly social Pokémon, often seen hovering over fields of flowers. It belongs to the **Bug** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. Because of its diet, it is frequently found holding **Honey**. Its wings are capable of high-frequency vibration, which it uses to sense the "auras" of living things, allowing it to predict weather patterns or the blooming of specific flowers across the Alolan islands.
