## Identity & Lore
Crocalor (Pokedex #910) is the Fire Croc Pokémon, a bipedal reptilian creature first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is characterized by its vibrant red scales and a peculiar, glowing fireball resting atop its head that resembles a bird's egg. This fireball is the result of Crocalor’s internal fire energy mixing with its overflowing vitality, and it serves as a focal point for its thermal power. As the middle evolutionary stage of the Paldean Fire-type starter, Fuecoco, it displays a more upright posture and a developing sense of rhythm that hints at its eventual transformation into the soulful singer, Skeledirge. While Crocalor does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a primary candidate for the Terastal phenomenon native to Paldea, often enhancing its Fire-type prowess with a Fire Tera Type.

## Evolution & Biology
Crocalor is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Fuecoco** starting at **Level 16** and further matures into the Fire/Ghost-type **Skeledirge** once it reaches **Level 36**. Biologically, it is a hardy creature with a "Medium-Slow" growth rate, reflecting the time needed to stabilize the intense fire energy within its body. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and its eggs generally require a standard incubation period (hatch counter 20) before they are ready to hatch. Its behavior is often described as energetic yet somewhat laid-back, mirroring the tropical temperament of its native Paldean habitat.
