## Identity & Lore
Kirlia (Pokedex #281) is the Emotion Pokémon, a dual-type Psychic/Fairy creature introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Resembling a ballerina, Kirlia balances on its tiptoes and possesses a highly developed brain capable of distorting the space around it to create mirages. It is deeply attuned to the feelings of its Trainer; when exposed to positive emotions, Kirlia grows beautiful and dances gracefully. While Kirlia does not possess alternative forms itself, it is the bridge to two powerful potential futures: the elegant **Gardevoir** (capable of Mega Evolution) and the blade-wielding **Gallade** (also capable of Mega Evolution). Additionally, the Paradox Pokémon **Iron Valiant** appears to be a robotic synthesis of Kirlia's two final evolutions.
