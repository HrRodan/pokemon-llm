## Identity & Lore
Hippowdon (Pokedex #450) is the formidable **Heavyweight Pokémon** introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. A massive, quadrupedal creature, it is distinguished by its ability to blast internally stored sand from ports on its body to generate towering twisters for both offense and camouflage. While the standard male form is light brown, the female variant is notable for its dark grey coloration, a prominent example of sexual dimorphism in Pokémon. Hippowdon is notoriously short-tempered and territorial, often found dominating arid deserts where it can burrow into the sand to ambush prey.

## Evolution & Biology
Hippowdon is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hippopotas** starting at **Level 34**. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and possesses a relatively slow growth rate. Unlike many Pokémon, Hippowdon does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, relying entirely on its raw natural bulk and weather control capabilities in battle.
