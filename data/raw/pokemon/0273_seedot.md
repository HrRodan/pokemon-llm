## Identity & Lore
Seedot (Pokedex #273) is the Acorn Pokémon introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Small and brown, this creature perfectly mimics the appearance of an acorn to camouflage itself on the forest floor, avoiding predation by bird Pokémon. Biologically, Seedot attaches itself to tree branches using the top of its head, hanging suspended while it siphons moisture and nutrients from the host plant. A healthy Seedot is characterized by a glossy, polished body, indicating it has consumed ample water. It is the first stage of the Shiftry line and serves as the version-exclusive counterpart to the Lotad line in the Hoenn region.
