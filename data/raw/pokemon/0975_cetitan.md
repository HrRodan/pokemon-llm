## Identity & Lore
Cetitan (Pokedex #975) is the massive Terra Whale Pokémon, a towering terrestrial mammal that dominates the frozen landscapes of the Paldea region in Generation IX. Standing at 4.5 meters and weighing a staggering 700kg, this white-colored behemoth is characterized by its five thick horns and a formidable body protected by powerful muscles and an immense layer of subterranean fat. Evolutionarily adapted from ocean-dwelling ancestors to survive on land, Cetitan wanders snowy, high-altitude mountain ranges. While it does not currently possess any known Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts, its sheer physical presence and biological connection to the ancient Paldean landscape make it a cornerstone species of the Great Crater’s surrounding peaks.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 170, Attack 113, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 55, Speed 73.
* **Archetype:** HP-Dominant Physical Tank / Weather Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ice-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, and Fire**. Its defensive profile is limited, as it only **resists Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Attack stat and physical prowess, Cetitan excels with **Ice Spinner** for reliable STAB damage, **Earthquake** for vital coverage against Steel and Fire types, **Ice Shard** for necessary priority to compensate for its middling speed, and **Liquidation** to punish Rock-type switch-ins.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Thick Fat:** Provides a crucial defensive cushion by halving damage from Fire and Ice-type moves, effectively neutralizing its Fire weakness.
    * **Slush Rush:** Doubling its Speed stat during a Snowstorm, transforming this bulky whale into a terrifying late-game sweeper.
    * **Sheer Force (Hidden):** Increases the power of moves with secondary effects by 30% at the cost of removing those effects, making moves like Iron Head or Liquidation even more devastating.

## Evolution & Biology
Cetitan is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cetoddle** when the pre-evolution is exposed to an **Ice Stone**. Biologically, Cetitan belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and its growth is classified as medium-slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Trainers breeding Cetitan should note its hatch counter of 25, reflecting the long gestation period of such a massive organism. Its anatomy is designed for extreme cold; the horns on its head are capable of gathering ice energy, which it uses to freeze its surroundings and protect its territory from rivals.
