## Identity & Lore
Sobble (#816) is the Water Lizard Pokémon, serving as the quintessential Water-type starter for trainers beginning their journey in the Galar region (Generation VIII). This timid, blue quadrupedal Pokémon is characterized by its remarkable physiological reaction to distress; when it feels threatened or embarrassed, it secretes tears with the chemical potency of 100 onions, forcing everyone in the vicinity to weep uncontrollably. This defense mechanism is complemented by its ability to camoflauge itself; when Sobble touches water, its skin changes color to match its surroundings, allowing it to become effectively invisible. While Sobble itself is small and unassuming, it holds significant evolutionary potential, eventually maturing into Inteleon, which possesses a powerful Gigantamax form capable of sniping targets from vast distances.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 40, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 40, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. In its unevolved state, Sobble relies on its superior Special Attack and Speed to outpace opponents before its frail defenses can be exploited.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Ice, Steel, and Water** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack stat, Sobble excels with high-power elemental attacks and tactical positioning. Key moves include **Hydro Pump** for raw power, **Surf** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Mud-Shot** for ground-type coverage and speed control, and **Water Pledge**, which can be combined with other starter moves for powerful field effects. It also has access to **U-turn** for pivoting and **Ice Shard** for priority chip damage.
* **Abilities:** **Torrent** (Increases the power of Water-type moves by 50% when HP is below one-third) and its Hidden Ability, **Sniper** (Power up moves if they become critical hits, dealing 2.25x damage instead of the usual 1.5x).

## Evolution & Biology
Sobble is the first stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Drizzile** upon reaching **Level 16**, which further evolves into the secret agent-inspired **Inteleon** starting at **Level 35**. Biologically, Sobble belongs to both the **Water 1** and **Field** (Ground) Egg Groups, making it a versatile candidate for breeding programs. It has a medium-slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 20, typical for starter Pokémon. Despite its fearful nature, its biology is highly adapted for aquatic stealth and chemical warfare through its specialized tear ducts and skin cells.
