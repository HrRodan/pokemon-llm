## Identity & Lore
Nidoqueen (Pokédex #031) is the Drill Pokémon, a formidable poison-pin bipedal creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its thick, armor-like blue scales, it possesses a bulky physique designed to shield its young from predators in its native grassland habitats. While it does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, Nidoqueen is renowned for its maternal instincts and ability to execute powerful attacks using its heavy body weight.

## Evolution & Biology
Nidoqueen is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Nidorina when exposed to a **Moon Stone**; Nidorina evolves from Nidoran♀ starting at Level 16. Despite being the fully evolved female form, Nidoqueen belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it is unable to breed in captivity, a unique biological trait shared with its pre-evolution Nidorina.
