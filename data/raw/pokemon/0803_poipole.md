## Identity & Lore
Poipole (#803) is the Poison Pin Pokémon, a unique lifeform classified as an Ultra Beast and known by the codename UB Adhesive. First appearing in Generation VII (Alola) within the Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon narratives, Poipole is a rare example of an Ultra Beast that displays a wide range of emotions and can even understand human speech. Unlike the more predatory Ultra Beasts, Poipole is well-liked in its home dimension of Ultra Megalopolis, where it is often chosen as a first partner Pokémon—similar to the starter Pokémon of the core regions. Its vibrant purple body and large head contain a glowing, adhesive venom that it sprays from the needles on its head while laughing, a behavior that blends playfulness with biological lethality. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution transforms it from a small, balanced creature into a devastating draconic predator.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 67, Attack 73, Defense 67, Sp. Atk 73, Sp. Def 67, Speed 73.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Setup Sweeper. While its base stats are perfectly balanced, it functions best as a Special Attacker in competitive tiers where it can utilize its setup moves.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground and Psychic**. It possesses valuable **resistances to Grass, Fighting, Poison, Bug, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Poipole utilizes a mix of utility and special offense to overcome its modest base stats. Key moves include **Sludge Wave** for high-accuracy STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Dragon Pulse** for essential neutral coverage (and to trigger evolution), **Nasty Plot** to sharply boost its offensive pressure, and **Toxic Spikes** to provide entry hazard support for its team.
* **Abilities:** **Beast Boost** (Its signature ability as an Ultra Beast; it boosts Poipole’s most proficient stat by one stage every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to snowball through an enemy team).

## Evolution & Biology
Poipole is part of a two-stage evolutionary line and is one of the few Ultra Beasts capable of evolving. It evolves into the powerful Poison/Dragon-type **Naganadel** only when it **levels up while knowing the move Dragon Pulse**. Biologically, it is categorized in the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. As a resident of Ultra Space, its physiology is adapted to environments outside the standard Pokémon world, and it is frequently associated with the Ultra Recon Squad. Its slow growth rate reflects the significant energy required to undergo its metamorphosis into a larger, winged beast.
