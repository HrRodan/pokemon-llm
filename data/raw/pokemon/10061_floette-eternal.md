## Identity & Lore
Eternal Flower Floette (Pokedex #10061) is the Single Bloom Pokémon and a unique, legendary-adjacent variant of the Floette species originating from the Kalos region (Generation VI). Unlike its standard counterparts, this specific Floette is inextricably tied to the history of the Kalos war 3,000 years ago and the tragic figure AZ, the former King of Kalos. It carries a unique, black-petaled flower known as the "Eternal Flower," which is said to contain terrifying power derived from the Ultimate Weapon. While the base species of Floette is known for fluttering around flower beds to care for wilting blossoms, the Eternal Flower form is a symbol of longevity and destruction, possessing stats that far exceed a typical Floette and even rival its evolved form, Florges. Although the Floette species does not possess Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, this specific variant represents a "Forme" change that remains locked in its current state, unable to undergo further evolution.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 74, Attack 65, Defense 67, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 128, Speed 92.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Wallbreaker. With its exceptional Special Defense and high Special Attack, it functions as a potent threat that can absorb special hits while retaliating with massive force.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fairy-type, it is **weak to Poison and Steel**. It **resists Fighting, Bug, and Dark**, and possesses a complete **immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive base 125 Special Attack, its most devastating move is its signature attack, **Light of Ruin**, which deals immense Fairy-type damage at the cost of recoil. To supplement this, it utilizes **Moonblast** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Psychic** to check Poison-type threats, and **Calm Mind** to further boost its already formidable special presence.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Flower Veil:** Prevents the lowering of stats and the infliction of status conditions on ally Grass-type Pokémon, making it a powerful support asset in Double Battles.
    * **Symbiosis (Hidden):** Allows the Pokémon to pass its held item to an ally that has just consumed its own item, enabling complex competitive strategies involving consumable berries or power-boosting items.

## Evolution & Biology
Floette is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. Under normal circumstances, a **Flabébé** evolves into **Floette** starting at level 19, and Floette can further evolve into **Florges** when exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. However, the **Eternal Flower Floette is an anomaly**; it is biologically locked and cannot evolve into Florges, nor can it be bred, effectively existing outside the standard life cycle of the Fairy Egg Group. Biologically, it is extremely light, weighing only 0.9kg and standing 0.2m tall. It draws out the hidden power of its unique black flower to channel energy that is both life-giving and destructive, reflecting its origins as a creature revived by the Ultimate Weapon.
