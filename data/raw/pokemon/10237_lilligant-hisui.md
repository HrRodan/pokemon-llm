## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Lilligant (Pokedex #10237) is the Flowering Pokémon, a majestic regional variant first discovered in the ancient Hisui region (the precursor to modern-day Sinnoh). While the species originated in Generation V (Unova), this Hisuian form adapted to the rugged terrain of the Diamond and Pearl Settlements, trading its stationary, queen-like appearance for a more agile, long-limbed dancer’s physique. Its flavor text notes that even veteran Trainers find it difficult to make its beautiful flower bloom, a testament to its finicky and refined nature. Unlike its Unovan counterpart, which is a pure Grass-type, the Hisuian variant incorporates Fighting-type mastery, reflecting its powerful legs and rhythmic combat style. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is uniquely known for its signature move, Victory Dance.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Lilligant is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Petilil** when exposed to a **Sun Stone** while in the Hisui region. Biologically, this form is characterized by its light weight (19.2 kg) and dancer-like movement, which allows it to traverse mountainous terrain and deliver devastating kicks. It belongs to the **Plant** egg group and has a medium growth rate. Its biology is deeply tied to the sun, as evidenced by its abilities and its requirement of a Sun Stone to reach its final form.
