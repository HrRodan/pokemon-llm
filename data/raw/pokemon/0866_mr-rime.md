## Identity & Lore
Mr. Rime (Pokedex #866) is the Comedian Pokémon, a unique dual Ice and Psychic-type introduced in Generation VIII (Galar). This purple, humanoid Pokémon is a master of performance, highly skilled at tap-dancing while waving a cane fashioned from solid ice to stay in rhythm with its graceful movements. Unlike its predecessor, the Kantonian Mr. Mime, Mr. Rime is an evolution specific to the Galarian lineage, characterized by the comical, face-like pattern on its torso that can even express emotions. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its existence as a regional evolution highlights the environmental adaptations of the Mime species in colder climates. Its presence in the Galar region is often associated with entertainment, though it is a formidable psychic practitioner that uses its cane to release freezing bursts of energy.

* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and unique Ice/Psychic STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) combination, key moves include **Freeze-Dry** (which allows it to hit Water-types super-effectively), **Psychic**, **Ice Beam**, and **Slack Off** for reliable recovery. It also has access to valuable utility moves like **Rapid Spin** to clear entry hazards and **Trick Room** to manipulate turn order.
* **Abilities:** **Screen Cleaner** (a signature ability that nullifies the effects of Light Screen, Reflect, and Aurora Veil for both sides upon entering battle), **Tangled Feet** (raises evasiveness if the Pokémon is confused), and the Hidden Ability **Ice Body** (gradually regains HP during a hailstorm or snow).

## Evolution & Biology
Mr. Rime is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Mime Jr.**, which evolves into **Galarian Mr. Mime** when leveled up while knowing the move **Mimic**. Galarian Mr. Mime then evolves into **Mr. Rime** starting at **Level 42**. This evolution represents a significant shift in temperament from the miming antics of its younger forms to the rhythmic tap-dancing of a seasoned performer. Biologically, it belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 25 (approximately 6,400 steps). Its physiology is adapted for both performance and survival in frigid environments, using its ice cane not just as a prop, but as a focus for its psychic powers.
