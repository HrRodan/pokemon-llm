## Identity & Lore
Omanyte (Pokedex #138) is the Spiral Pokémon, a prehistoric aquatic creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Although long considered extinct, this species is frequently genetically resurrected from the **Helix Fossil** found in ancient seabeds. Residing in the primordial seas, this blue, tentacled Pokémon utilizes the air stored in its spiraled shell to regulate buoyancy, allowing it to rise and sink in the water at will. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is revered in lore as one of the original fossil Pokémon alongside Kabuto.

## Evolution & Biology
Omanyte is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Omastar** starting at **Level 40**. To obtain an Omanyte, a trainer typically must first locate a Helix Fossil and regenerate it at a scientific lab. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 3** Egg Groups, requiring approximately 30 egg cycles to hatch.
