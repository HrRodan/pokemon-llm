## Identity & Lore
Enamorus-Therian (Pokedex #10249) is the Love-Hate Pokémon, a legendary entity introduced in Generation VIII within the ancient Hisui region. This specific form, known as the **Therian Forme**, transforms Enamorus from her cloud-riding humanoid appearance into a stout, serpentine, turtle-like creature, signaling a shift from aggression to endurance. According to Hisuian legend, her arrival from across the sea heralds the end of bitter winters, as her "love" stimulates the budding of fresh life across the land. As the fourth member of the Forces of Nature—joining Landorus, Thundurus, and Tornadus—she balances the elemental quartet. While she does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, her ability to shift forms via the **Reveal Glass** allows her to adapt to different tactical requirements.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 74, Attack 115, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 135, Sp. Def 100, Speed 46.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Wallbreaker / Trick Room Attacker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison, Steel, Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Fighting and Bug**, resists **Dark and Grass**, and maintains complete **Immunity to Ground and Dragon** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and its need for coverage against its many weaknesses, key moves include **Springtide Storm** (its signature move which can boost stats or lower the opponent's), **Moonblast** (high-powered Fairy STAB), **Earth Power** (essential coverage against Steel, Rock, and Poison types), and **Mystical Fire** (to punish Steel-types and lower their Special Attack).
* **Abilities:** **Overcoat** (Grants total immunity to weather-based damage from Sandstorm or Snow, and protects the Pokémon from powder-based moves like Spore, Sleep Powder, and Rage Powder, making it a reliable pivot in VGC and competitive doubles).

## Evolution & Biology
Enamorus-Therian is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of a traditional multi-stage evolutionary line. It exists as one of two distinct states: the Speed-oriented Incarnate Forme and this bulkier, slower Therian Forme. The transition is triggered only when exposed to the **Reveal Glass** artifact. Biologically, she is a female-only species and belongs to the **No Eggs** group, meaning she cannot be bred. Despite her pink coloration and "Love-Hate" classification, she is a fierce guardian of the changing seasons. Her slow growth rate and high base experience reflect her status as a high-tier legendary entity of the Hisuian wilderness.
