## Identity & Lore
Hatenna (Pokedex #856) is the Calm Pokémon, a sensitive creature first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. This small, pink Pokémon is characterized by the protrusion on its head, which functions as a biological sensor for picking up the emotions of other living beings. Its behavior is dictated entirely by the emotional "noise" of its environment; it will never warm up to individuals who lack a calm disposition and will actively flee from anyone projecting strong or aggressive feelings. While Hatenna itself is a pure Psychic-type, its evolutionary lineage is deeply tied to the "Forest Witch" mythos. Its final evolution, Hatterene, is notable for possessing a powerful Gigantamax form, though Hatenna is primarily found in quiet, secluded areas like the Glimwood Tangle.

## Evolution & Biology
Hatenna is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Hattrem** starting at Level 32, which subsequently evolves into the powerful **Hatterene** once it reaches Level 42. This growth reflects the Pokémon's increasing intolerance for emotional outbursts, as its evolutions become more physically capable of silencing noisy surroundings. Hatenna belongs to the **Fairy** egg group, mirroring its whimsical appearance and magical capabilities. It has a slow growth rate, requiring patient cultivation from its trainer, and is found exclusively in female-only populations.
