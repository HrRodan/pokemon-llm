## Identity & Lore
Blipbug (Pokedex #824) is the Larva Pokémon, first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. A small, blue-colored larva known for its massive, compound eyes and prominent, eyebrow-like bristles, Blipbug is often found in the fields and gardens of its native region. While it is physically fragile, it is remarkably intelligent; it uses the hairs on its body to sense its surroundings and collect information, though its lack of strength makes it a cautious and defensive creature in the wild. As it matures, Blipbug’s biology undergoes significant radical transformations, eventually culminating in its final form, Orbeetle, which possesses the potential to Gigantamax into a massive, UFO-like entity capable of immense psychic power.

## Evolution & Biology
Blipbug is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the cocoon-like **Dottler** starting at Level 10, which eventually evolves into the predatory **Orbeetle** at Level 30. This progression reflects its biological growth from a simple information-collecting larva into a highly sophisticated psychic predator. Blipbug belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, indicating a relatively fast breeding cycle for trainers. As a "Larva Pokémon," it spends most of its early life feeding and gathering data to prepare for its sedentary stage as Dottler.
