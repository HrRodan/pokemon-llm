## Identity & Lore
Cottonee (Pokedex #546) is the Cotton Puff Pokémon, a Grass and Fairy-type creature first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a small, circular green entity surrounded by white, billowy fluff, Cottonee is exceptionally light, weighing only 0.6kg, which allows it to be carried easily by mountain winds. When threatened, it defends itself by expelling massive quantities of cotton from its body; this fluff acts as a decoy to distract predators while Cottonee escapes. While Cottonee itself does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, it is closely associated with the whimsy of the forest and is often found in groups, floating together when the wind is favorable.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 27, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 37, Sp. Def 50, Speed 66.
* **Archetype:** Prankster Support / Status Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Poison** and is also weak to **Flying, Bug, Fire, Ice, and Steel**. It provides valuable resistances against **Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, Fighting, and Dark**, and maintains a complete **Immunity to Dragon**.
* **Move Selection:** Despite its low offensive stats, Cottonee excels in utility and tactical disruption. Key moves include **Tailwind** for team speed control, **Encore** to lock opponents into unfavorable moves, and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) options like **Energy Ball** and **Dazzling Gleam** to chip away at targets.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Prankster:** Grants +1 priority to all status-category moves, making Cottonee an elite disruptor regardless of its raw Speed stat.
    * **Infiltrator:** Allows moves to bypass the effects of an opponent's Substitute, Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil.
    * **Chlorophyll (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon’s Speed stat during harsh sunlight, though this is often overlooked in favor of Prankster.

## Evolution & Biology
Cottonee is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Whimsicott** when exposed to a **Sun Stone**. This evolution is not level-dependent and can occur at any time once the stone is applied. Biologically, it is highly social and belongs to both the **Plant** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. With a hatch counter of 20, it is relatively easy to breed for competitive use. In the wild, Cottonee are known to get caught in rain, which makes their cotton heavy and prevents them from floating, making them vulnerable until they dry out in the sun.
