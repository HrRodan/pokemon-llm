## Identity & Lore
Cetoddle (Pokedex #974) is the Terra Whale Pokémon, a fascinating species introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). This pure Ice-type creature is notable for its evolutionary history; lore indicates that its ancestors once lived in the ocean but migrated to land a very long time ago. Its physical design, characterized by a rounded white body and a large horn, suggests a close biological relationship to the Wailmer line, effectively serving as a terrestrial, cold-weather counterpart. Cetoddle typically inhabits snowy regions where it can stay cool, as its thick layer of fat and specialized skin are adapted for sub-zero temperatures. While Cetoddle does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its evolved form, Cetitan, is renowned for its massive physical presence and dominance in the snowy mountain ranges of Paldea.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 108, Attack 68, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 40, Speed 43.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker. While its defensive stats are low, its massive Base HP allows it to survive hits that would knock out other unevolved Pokémon, particularly in Little Cup formats.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Fighting, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its Attack stat over its very low Special Attack, Cetoddle excels with moves like **Icicle Crash** for heavy STAB damage, **Ice Shard** to compensate for its low Speed with priority, **Play Rough** for Fairy-type coverage against Fighting types, and **Body Slam** to take advantage of its bulk and potential for paralysis.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Thick Fat:** Provides excellent defensive utility by halving the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves.
    * **Snow Cloak:** Increases evasion during snowstorms, making it harder to hit in weather-specific teams.
    * **Sheer Force (Hidden Ability):** Removes secondary effects from moves (like flinching or stat drops) to increase their damage by 30%, making moves like Icicle Crash significantly more powerful.

## Evolution & Biology
Cetoddle is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Cetitan** when exposed to an **Ice Stone**. Biologically, Cetoddle belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, reflecting its transition from a sea-dwelling ancestor to a land-based mammal. It has a hatch counter of 25, meaning it requires a moderate amount of travel to hatch from an Egg. Despite its cute, spherical appearance, its "Terra Whale" classification highlights its immense size potential, weighing 45kg even in its unevolved state.
