## Identity & Lore
Carvanha (Pokedex #318) is the Savage Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Dark aquatic predator introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a piranha with rough, red and blue skin, it inhabits the sea and rivers where it hunts in packs. Its biology is defined by its incredibly developed jaws and sharply pointed fangs, which possess enough destructive power to rip through boat hulls and sink vessels. While a solitary Carvanha is timid, they become extremely aggressive when gathered in large numbers. Although it does not possess alternate forms itself, it is the pre-evolution of Sharpedo, a Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 90, Defense 20, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 20, Speed 65.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Glass Cannon / Late-Game Cleaner.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass, Electric, Fighting, Bug, and Fairy** types. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, Ghost, Steel, and Dark** types and is **immune to Psychic** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack stat (90) and fragile defenses, its optimal moveset focuses on aggressive physical strikes and priority. Key moves include **Liquidation** (high power STAB), **Crunch** (Dark STAB), **Psychic Fangs** (coverage against Fighting types), and **Aqua Jet** (priority to compensate for speed tiers). **Flip Turn** is also valuable for pivoting.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rough Skin:** Inflicts damage to the attacker if they hit Carvanha with a contact move.
    *   **Speed Boost (Hidden Ability):** Its Speed stat is increased by one stage at the end of each turn. This makes Carvanha a dangerous threat if left on the field for multiple turns.

## Evolution & Biology
Carvanha is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Sharpedo** starting at **Level 30**. In the wild, Carvanha can occasionally be found holding a **Deep Sea Tooth**. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
