## Identity & Lore
Latias (Pokedex #380) is the Eon Pokémon, a Legendary Dragon/Psychic-type entity introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Characterized by her aerodynamic body and red-and-white coloration, Latias is highly sensitive to the emotions of people. She possesses high intelligence, capable of understanding human speech and communicating telepathically. According to lore, if she senses hostility, she ruffles the feathers all over her body and cries shrilly to intimidate the foe. She is the female counterpart to Latios, forming the "Eon Duo," and is often associated with the **Soul Dew** item. While she does not evolve in the traditional sense, she is capable of transforming into **Mega Latias** in battle using the Latiasite.
