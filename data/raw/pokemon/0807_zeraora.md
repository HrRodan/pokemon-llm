## Identity & Lore
Zeraora (#807) is the Thunderclap Pokémon, a rare and powerful Mythical species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This bipedal, feline-like creature is distinguished by its vibrant yellow fur and the ability to generate massive amounts of electricity from its paw pads, which it uses to create powerful magnetic fields for high-speed locomotion. Unlike most Electric-type Pokémon, Zeraora does not have an internal organ for generating electricity; instead, it gathers and stores energy from external sources. Its lore describes it as a predatory force that electrifies its claws to tear opponents apart, often electrocuting foes with stray sparks even if they manage to dodge the initial strike. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it gained significant notoriety for its signature move, Plasma Fists, and its role as a guardian-like figure in the Alola-era cinematic history.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 88, Attack 112, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 102, Sp. Def 80, Speed 143.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With a blistering Speed stat of 143, Zeraora outpaces nearly the entire unboosted metagame, serving as a premier "Revenge Killer" and offensive pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Electric-type, it is **weak to Ground**. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high physical Attack and elite Speed, Zeraora’s most effective kit includes:
    * **Plasma Fists:** Its signature move that deals massive physical damage and converts all Normal-type moves into Electric-type for the remainder of the turn.
    * **Close Combat:** Essential Fighting-type coverage that threatens Steel, Rock, and Ice-types that might otherwise wall its primary attacks.
    * **Knock Off:** A vital utility move that punishes switch-ins by removing their held items while dealing consistent damage.
    * **Blaze Kick:** Provides crucial Fire-type coverage to handle Grass and Bug-types, which resist its Electric-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).
* **Abilities:** Volt Absorb (This ability grants Zeraora immunity to Electric-type moves, instead healing 25% of its maximum HP when struck by them, making it an excellent switch-in against predicted Volt Switches).

## Evolution & Biology
Zeraora is a single-stage Mythical Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. As a Mythical entity, it belongs to the "No Eggs Discovered" group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is highly territorial and mobile, often appearing like a lightning bolt to those who catch a glimpse of it in the wild. Its hatch counter is exceptionally high (120), reflecting its status as a legendary-tier discovery. It possesses a "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full combat potential.
