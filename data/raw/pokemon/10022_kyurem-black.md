## Identity & Lore
Black Kyurem (Pokedex #10022) is the formidable Boundary Pokémon, a legendary dual Dragon and Ice-type entity that first emerged in the Unova region (Generation V). This specific form is not a natural evolution but a complex fusion achieved when Kyurem absorbs the power of the legendary Pokémon Zekrom through the use of the DNA Splicers. It generates a powerful, freezing energy inside its massive 3.3-meter frame; however, lore suggests its body became partially frozen when this overwhelming energy leaked outward, resulting in its asymmetric, ice-clad appearance. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Black Kyurem represents one half of the "Ultimate Dragon" from Unovan mythology. Its gray, bulky physique is electrified by the presence of Zekrom’s power, combining the absolute zero of Kyurem with the high-voltage electricity of its counterpart.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 125, Attack 170, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 120, Sp. Def 90, Speed 95.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Mixed Attacker. With a colossal Base 170 Attack stat, it is one of the most powerful physical forces in the history of Pokémon.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, Fire, Dragon, and Fairy**. It possesses **resistances to Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive physical Attack and decent Special Attack, key moves include **Fusion Bolt** (an Electric-type move inherited from Zekrom), **Freeze-Shock** (its signature physical Ice-type move), **Icicle Spear** (for consistent multi-hit Ice STAB), and **Dragon Dance** (to patch up its middling Speed and boost its sweeping potential).
* **Abilities:** Teravolt (This ability functions identically to Mold Breaker, allowing Black Kyurem’s moves to ignore the abilities of targets, such as hitting through Multiscale, Sturdy, or Levitate).

## Evolution & Biology
Black Kyurem is a unique legendary form and does not follow a traditional evolutionary line. It originates from the base Pokémon Kyurem when it is fused with Zekrom using the DNA Splicers key item. This process is reversible, allowing it to return to its base form or transform into Kyurem-White if fused with Reshiram instead. Biologically, it is a genderless apex predator that cannot breed, belonging to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group. It has a slow growth rate, requiring massive amounts of experience to reach its full potential. Despite its frozen exterior, its internal biology is a volatile mix of freezing cold and kinetic electrical energy, making it a "boundary" between two opposing elemental forces.
