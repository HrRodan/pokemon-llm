## Identity & Lore
Zygarde 10% Form (Pokedex #10181) is the canine-like manifestation of the Order Pokémon, appearing as a sleek, black-and-green hound. Though its official National Pokédex number is #718, this specific form represents a gathering of 10% of the Zygarde Cells scattered throughout the environment. Originating from the Kalos region (Generation VI), it serves as a guardian of the ecosystem, emerging from its subterranean habitats when the natural balance falls into disarray. While this form lacks the sheer bulk of its counterparts, it is built for speed and swift strikes, acting as a scout or initial responder to environmental threats. Beyond this 10% state, Zygarde can assemble into its serpent-like **50% Form** or its titan-like **Complete Form**, the latter of which boasts power exceeding that of the legendary Pokémon Xerneas and Yveltal.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 54, Attack 100, Defense 71, Sp. Atk 61, Sp. Def 85, Speed 115.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With a high base Speed of 115 and a solid Attack stat, this form functions as a "Glass Cannon," meant to outpace opponents and deal significant damage before its low HP can be exploited.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Dragon and Fairy**, and suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ice**. Conversely, it **resists Poison, Fire, and Rock**, and possesses a total **immunity to Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical prowess and unique signature moves, Zygarde 10% utilizes **Thousand Arrows** (a legendary Ground-type move that hits Flying-types and those with Levitate), **Extreme Speed** for high-priority finishing, **Outrage** for massive Dragon-type damage, and **Dragon Dance** to further boost its sweeping potential.
* **Abilities:** **Aura Break** (This ability reverses the effects of "Aura" abilities, turning the power boosts of Xerneas's Fairy Aura and Yveltal's Dark Aura into reductions). In competitive contexts, it is also known for the **Power Construct** ability, which allows it to transform into its Complete Form when its health drops below half.

## Evolution & Biology
Zygarde 10% is part of a unique biological assembly rather than a standard evolutionary line. It does not evolve through levels; instead, it is synthesized from **Zygarde Cells and Cores** using a Zygarde Cube. Its physical form is determined by the percentage of cells gathered (10%, 50%, or 100%). Biologically, it is an assembly of individual organisms acting with a single hive mind. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred, and it follows a Slow growth rate, typical of Legendary Pokémon. Despite its canine appearance in this form, it remains a Ground/Dragon-type entity with deep ties to the earth's ley lines and the preservation of the Kalosian biosphere.
