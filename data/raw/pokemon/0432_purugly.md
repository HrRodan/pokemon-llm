## Identity & Lore
Purugly (Pokedex #432) is the Tiger Cat Pokémon, a Normal-type introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). While it appears lethargic and overweight due to its bulky, gray frame, this Pokémon is actually a muscular and brazen brute known for its shocking agility. Its signature behavior involves barging into the nests of other Pokémon and claiming them as its own. To appear intimidatingly larger, Purugly tightly binds its forked tails around its waist like a corset; however, when it releases this tension, its musculature allows for explosive bursts of speed. It is often associated with Team Galactic Commander Mars in the Sinnoh region lore.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 71, Attack 82, Defense 64, Sp. Atk 64, Sp. Def 59, Speed 112.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Pivot / Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and holds an **immunity to Ghost**. Thanks to its Thick Fat ability, it also effectively gains resistance to Fire and Ice types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its surprisingly high Speed and decent Attack, key moves include **Fake Out** (for priority flinching), **Body Slam** (reliable STAB with paralysis chance), **Play Rough** (coverage against Fighting-types), and **U-turn** (to pivot out while dealing damage). **Knock Off** and **Sucker Punch** are also viable options for utility and priority.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Thick Fat:** Halves the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves, granting artificial resistances.
    *   **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused and blocks the Intimidate ability in later generations.
    *   **Defiant (Hidden):** sharply raises the user's Attack stat by two stages when any stat is lowered by an opponent, making it a strong counter to Intimidate users.

## Evolution & Biology
Purugly is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Glameow** starting at **Level 38**. Unlike its pre-evolution, which feigns innocence, Purugly is openly aggressive. In the wild, it may be found holding a Cheri Berry. It belongs to the **Field** (referred to as "Ground" in data) Egg Group, and hatches after approximately 20 egg cycles.
