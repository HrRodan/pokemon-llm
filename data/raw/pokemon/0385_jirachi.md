## Identity & Lore
Jirachi (Pokedex #385) is the Mythical **Wish Pokémon** first discovered in Generation III (Hoenn). A small, yellow, humanoid entity, it is famously known for hibernating for 1,000 years within a crystalline cocoon, only awakening for seven days when the Millennium Comet is visible in the night sky. Lore states that Jirachi possesses the ability to grant any wish written on the three blue tags hanging from its star-shaped head. Even while asleep, it is capable of fighting to defend itself if it senses danger. Though it has no known biological forms, it is distinct for its third "true eye" located on its stomach, which opens only to absorb energy for its signature attacks.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 100, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 100, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Versatile Utility & Serene Grace Abuser.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Steel/Psychic type, it is **weak to Fire, Ground, Ghost, and Dark**. However, it boasts incredible defensive utility, being **immune to Poison** and resisting **Normal, Flying, Rock, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its balanced stats and ability, key moves include **Iron Head** (which becomes a flinch-locking tool), **Doom Desire** (its massive delayed-damage signature move), **Wish** (for reliable healing), and **U-turn** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups).
*   **Abilities:** **Serene Grace**. This ability doubles the probability of additional effects occurring with attacks. For Jirachi, this makes moves like Iron Head have a 60% chance to cause the opponent to flinch.

## Evolution & Biology
Jirachi is a standalone **Mythical Pokémon** and is not part of an evolutionary line. Unlike most Pokémon, it belongs to the **No-Eggs (Undiscovered)** Group and cannot be bred. In the wild, it is exceptionally rare, usually found in mountainous habitats or associated with celestial events.
