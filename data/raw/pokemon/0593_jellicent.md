## Identity & Lore
Jellicent (Pokedex #593) is the Floating Pokémon, a spectral marine entity first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its distinct gender dimorphism—males are vibrant blue with a mustache-like ruffle, while females are bright pink with a lace-like collar—Jellicent is often feared by sailors. Its body is composed almost entirely of seawater, allowing it to drift through the ocean depths where it preys on life energy. The lore surrounding Jellicent is grim; it is said that any ship or crew that wanders into its territory is doomed to vanish, pulled down to a watery grave in their sunken vessels. Despite its delicate, crown-like appearance, it is a formidable apex predator of the deep. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique typing and haunting presence make it a staple of undersea legends.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 60, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 85, Sp. Def 105, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Defensive Wall. With high HP and excellent Special Defense, Jellicent excels at absorbing hits and stalling opponents.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Grass, Electric, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses valuable **resistances to Fire, Water, Ice, Poison, Bug, and Steel**, and is completely **immune to Normal and Fighting** moves due to its Ghost typing.
* **Move Selection:** Jellicent utilizes its Special Attack and utility pool to outlast foes. Key moves include **Scald** (to inflict burns and mitigate its lower physical defense), **Shadow Ball** (powerful STAB ghost damage), **Recover** (essential reliable semi-invulnerable healing), and **Will-O-Wisp** or **Ice Beam** for status spreading or dragon-type coverage.
* **Abilities:** **Water Absorb** (restores HP when hit by Water-type moves, providing a third immunity); **Cursed Body** (has a 30% chance to disable a move that deals damage to it); **Damp** (prevents all Pokémon on the field from using self-destructing moves like Explosion).

## Evolution & Biology
Jellicent is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Frillish** once it reaches **Level 40**. Biologically, it is a highly buoyant organism that uses its veil-like tentacles to entangle prey. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group, and its reproductive cycles are often tied to the shifting ocean currents. Trainers seeking to hatch a Frillish will find it has a hatch counter of 20, requiring a moderate amount of travel to bring to life. Despite its regal and soft appearance, its weight of 135.0 kg suggests a dense, pressurized composition suited for the crushing depths of the Unovan seas.
