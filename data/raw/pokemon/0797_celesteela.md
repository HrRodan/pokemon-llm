## Identity & Lore
Celesteela (Pokedex #797) is the Launch Pokémon, a massive and enigmatic creature first discovered in the Alola region during the Generation VII era. As one of the formidable Ultra Beasts, known by the code name UB-04 Blaster, it emerged from the Ultra Wormhole possessing a physical form that seamlessly blends organic bamboo-like structures with a high-tech metallic space shuttle aesthetic. Standing at over 30 feet tall and weighing a maximum-possible 999.9 kg, Celesteela is one of the heaviest Pokémon in existence. Its biology is unique; it stores high-pressure flammable gas within its two massive, detached arms, which it expels to fly across the sky at high speeds or to incinerate everything in its vicinity. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, its status as an Ultra Beast places it in a power bracket comparable to Legendary Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Celesteela is a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is extraterrestrial in origin, characterized by a slow growth rate and a complete lack of biological gender. Despite its "green" coloration and plant-like appearance, its composition is primarily metallic. It is often observed in the wild standing motionless like a tree, deeply rooted in the ground to absorb nutrients, only to suddenly ignite its propulsion systems and launch into the atmosphere without warning.
