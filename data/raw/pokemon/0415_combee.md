## Identity & Lore
Combee (Pokedex #415) is the dual-type Bug/Flying Tiny Bee Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Physiologically unique, this organism is actually a colony formed by three distinct tiny Pokémon merged into a single yellow, honeycomb-shaped unit. Combee is driven by a singular purpose: it tirelessly gathers nectar to create sweet floral honey, which it transports to the colony's queen, Vespiquen. While generally docile, they will form a defensive wall to protect their queen if threatened. In the wild, Combee are often found holding Honey.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 30, Defense 42, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 42, Speed 70.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Scout / Little Cup Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock** projectiles. It is also weak to Fire, Electric, Ice, and Flying types. However, it possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4 damage)** against Fighting and Grass types, resists Bug moves, and is **Immune** to Ground attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its surprisingly high Speed tier relative to its other stats, Combee functions best with utility and disruption. Key moves include **Tailwind** (to boost team speed), **Endeavor** (to exploit its low HP), **Dual Wingbeat** (Physical STAB), and **Bug Bite** (to consume opponent berries).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Honey Gather:** The Pokémon may gather Honey after a battle; primarily a non-combat utility.
    *   **Hustle (Hidden):** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% but lowers the accuracy of physical moves by 20%, making Combee a risky but harder-hitting physical attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Combee is part of a two-stage evolutionary line with a strict biological restriction. While it evolves into **Vespiquen**, this process is exclusive to **female** Combee. Evolution occurs when a female is leveled up to **Level 21**. Male Combee are incapable of evolution and exist solely to serve the hive. It belongs to the Bug Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
