## Identity & Lore
Mega Diancie (Pokedex #10075) is the Jewel Pokémon, a majestic and brilliant transformation of the Mythical Pokémon Diancie. Originating in the Kalos region (Generation VI), this pink-colored entity is described as the loveliest sight in the world, featuring a glimmering body composed of compressed diamonds. While it is technically a sudden, stable mutation of Carbink, Mega Diancie represents the peak of its biological potential. In the Pokémon world, it is the only Mythical Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution, a process triggered by the bond with its trainer and the presence of a Diancite Mega Stone. Its presence is often associated with the "Diamond Domain," where it serves as a sovereign protector.

* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its dual-offensive capabilities and signature utility, key moves include **Diamond Storm** (a signature Rock-type move that can sharply raise Defense), **Moonblast** (its primary Fairy-type Special STAB), **Earth Power** (essential coverage for Steel and Poison-type threats), and **Stealth Rock** (valuable entry hazard support) or **Psyshock** (to bypass special walls).
* **Abilities:** Magic Bounce (A powerful tactical ability that reflects non-damaging moves, such as Taunt, Stealth Rock, and Toxic, back at the attacker, making Mega Diancie an excellent lead and anti-utility pivot).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Diancie is a temporary evolutionary form of the standalone Mythical Pokémon Diancie. While it belongs to the "No-Eggs" group and cannot breed, its biological origin is linked to Carbink, though the exact mechanism of its spontaneous creation remains a mystery of the Kalos region. It does not follow a traditional leveling evolution chain; instead, it undergoes Mega Evolution during battle if the trainer possesses a Mega Bracelet and the Pokémon holds its specific Mega Stone. Biologically, the transformation increases its density and refracts light to create a dazzling array of pink crystals that it can expend in battle to create its signature "Diamond Storm."
