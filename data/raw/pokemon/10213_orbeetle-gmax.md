## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Orbeetle (Pokedex #10213) is the massive G-Max variant of the Seven Spot Pokémon, first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. While the standard Orbeetle is already famous for its immense intelligence and large brain, its Gigantamax form manifests as a colossal, glowing UFO-like entity. Its wing cases have expanded into a massive, disc-shaped shell that emits overwhelming psychic energy, allowing it to control the gravity of everything in its vicinity. This red-hued, extraterrestrial-looking Pokémon is often found in the Wild Area’s Power Spots, where the Galar particle energy is densest. Its intelligence is said to be so high that it can perceive every possible outcome of a battle simultaneously.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 45, Defense 110, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 120, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Utility Tank. With its exceptional 110 Defense and 120 Sp. Defense, Orbeetle-Gmax is designed to absorb hits while controlling the battlefield, though its low base HP requires careful management.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Flying, Rock, Bug, Ghost, and Dark** types. It **resists Fighting, Ground, Grass, and Psychic** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack and utility-heavy movepool, key moves for Orbeetle include **Psychic** for high-damage STAB, **Bug Buzz** to bypass substitutes, **Sticky Web** to provide speed control for the team, and **Recover** (or Calm Mind) to sustain its longevity on the field. In its Gigantamax state, its Psychic-type moves transform into **G-Max Gravitas**, which deals heavy damage and intensifies gravity for five turns, causing moves with lower accuracy (like Thunder or Blizzard) to hit more reliably.
* **Abilities:** **Swarm** (Increases Bug-type move power by 50% when HP is low), **Frisk** (Identifies the opponent's held item upon entering battle), and **Telepathy** (Hidden Ability; prevents damage from teammates' moves in doubles, making it an excellent partner for users of Earthquake or Surf).

## Evolution & Biology
Orbeetle-Gmax is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Blipbug**, a small larva Pokémon, which evolves into the radome-inspired **Dottler** starting at **Level 10**. Dottler then evolves into **Orbeetle** at **Level 30**. To achieve the Gigantamax form specifically, an Orbeetle must either be caught in a Max Raid Battle at a Power Spot or be fed **Max Soup** containing Max Mushrooms in the Isle of Armor. Biologically, it belongs to the **Bug** egg group and is characterized by its "wings" shape and rapid growth rate. Despite its frail appearance as a Blipbug, its final form represents the pinnacle of insectoid psychic evolution.
