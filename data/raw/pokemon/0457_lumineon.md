## Identity & Lore
Lumineon (Pokedex #457) is the Neon Pokémon, a bioluminescent aquatic creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Dwelling on the dark deep-sea floor, this Water-type predator utilizes the flashing patterns on its four tail fins to lure prey before attacking, earning it a reputation as a beauty of the abyss. Its coloring is primarily blue with neon highlights that mimic the starry night sky. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it is ecologically significant as a rival to Lanturn in deep-ocean environments.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 69, Attack 69, Defense 76, Sp. Atk 69, Sp. Def 86, Speed 91.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Pivot / Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It naturally **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Due to its equal offensive stats but high utility potential, Lumineon functions best when disrupting opponents and pivoting. Key moves include **Scald** (for STAB and burn chance), **Flip Turn** (to deal damage while switching out), **Defog** (to clear entry hazards), and **Tailwind** (to double team speed). Other viable options include *Ice Beam* for coverage or *Encore* to lock enemies into moves.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, allowing it to outpace almost all threats.
    *   **Storm Drain:** Draws in all single-target Water-type moves used by foes to itself, nullifying the damage and boosting its Special Attack.
    *   **Water Veil (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by a burn, ensuring its physical Attack stat remains unhindered.

## Evolution & Biology
Lumineon is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Finneon** starting at **Level 31**. In the wild, it can occasionally be found holding a **Rindo Berry**, suggesting an adaptation to mitigate damage from Grass-type predators. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and possesses a growth rate that is slow initially but becomes very fast later in its development.
