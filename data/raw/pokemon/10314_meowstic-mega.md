## Identity & Lore
Mega Meowstic (Pokedex #10314) is the Constraint Pokémon, a powerful Psychic-type evolution introduced in the Kalos region of Generation VI. While Meowstic is famously known for its striking sexual dimorphism—where males focus on defensive support and females on aggressive offense—this Mega-Evolved state pushes its latent mental capabilities to catastrophic levels. According to local lore, Meowstic must keep its ears tightly folded to contain its immense psychic energy; when threatened, it raises them to unleash a telekinetic force powerful enough to grind a 10-ton truck into fine dust. This blue, feline Pokémon embodies the "Constraint" genus by constantly struggling to manage the sheer volume of power flowing through its sensory organs. In its base form, Meowstic is one of the few species whose movepool and hidden abilities (such as Prankster for males and Competitive for females) drastically change based on gender, making the potential for a Mega Evolution a significant tactical upgrade for the species.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 74, Attack 48, Defense 76, Sp. Atk 143, Sp. Def 101, Speed 124.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper. With a blistering Speed tier and a massive Special Attack stat, Mega Meowstic functions as a glass-cannon offensive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark** types. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** damage.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Psychic** for heavy STAB damage, **Shadow Ball** for coverage against Ghost-types, **Signal Beam** to threaten Dark-types, and **Calm Mind** to further boost its sweeping potential.
* **Abilities:** While this specific data entry focuses on the Mega state, Meowstic typically draws from abilities like **Prankster** (granting priority to status moves), **Infiltrator** (bypassing screens and substitutes), or **Competitive** (sharply raising Special Attack when stats are lowered). In a Mega-Evolved state, these traits culminate in a focused, high-output offensive presence.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Meowstic is part of a two-stage evolutionary line that begins with the enigmatic Espurr. It evolves from Espurr once it reaches **Level 25**. As a member of the **Ground** egg group, it requires approximately 20 hatch cycles to produce offspring. Its biology is defined by the patterns inside its ears, which serve as the primary conduits for its psychic output. The transition from Meowstic to Mega Meowstic represents a complete removal of the "constraints" normally placed on its mind, allowing it to manipulate gravity and matter with effortless precision. Despite its small stature of 0.8 meters and light weight of 10.1 kg, its presence on the battlefield is dictated entirely by its overwhelming mental pressure.
