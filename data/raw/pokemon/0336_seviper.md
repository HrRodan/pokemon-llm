## Identity & Lore
Seviper (Pokedex #336) is the Fang Snake Pokémon, a Poison-type entity originally discovered in the **Generation III (Hoenn)** region. Known for its distinct black scales and scythe-like red tail, Seviper is defined by its deep-seated, generations-long blood feud with the Pokémon **Zangoose**. This biological rivalry is so intense that the scars visible on Seviper's body are canonically cited as evidence of their vicious, constant battles. Inhabiting grasslands, Seviper wraps its long, serpentine body around opponents to restrict movement before striking with its poisonous tail blade. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its lore is central to the ecological narrative of the Hoenn region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 73, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 65.
*   **Archetype:** Mixed Wallbreaker / Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Poison-type, it is **weak to Ground and Psychic** attacks. It naturally **resists Fighting, Poison, Bug, Grass, and Fairy** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its equal Attack and Special Attack stats (100 base), Seviper functions best as a mixed attacker capable of breaking defensive walls. Key moves include **Sludge Bomb** (STAB), **Earthquake** (coverage against Steel and Poison), **Flamethrower** (coverage against Steel), and **Coil** (to simultaneously boost Attack, Defense, and Accuracy). Alternatively, **Sucker Punch** provides essential priority to compensate for its average speed.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Shed Skin:** Has a 33% chance of healing any status condition at the end of each turn, providing resilience against paralysis or burns.
    *   **Infiltrator (Hidden):** Allows Seviper's moves to ignore the enemy's Substitute, Reflect, Light Screen, or Aurora Veil, making it an excellent counter to defensive stall strategies.

## Evolution & Biology
Seviper is a standalone, single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, making it a versatile parent for passing down moves within these groups. It has a Hatch Counter of 20. While it has no evolutionary relatives, its biology is historically linked to Zangoose through their shared predator-prey dynamic.
