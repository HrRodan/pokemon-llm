## Identity & Lore
Flapple (Pokedex #841) is the Apple Wing Pokémon, a unique Grass/Dragon-type creature that first appeared in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It is characterized by its green, draconic body that utilizes the skin of a sour apple as both armor and functional wings. According to Galarian lore, the evolution into Flapple is triggered specifically by the consumption of a Tart Apple, which induces a chemical reaction that transforms its physiology. Within its cheeks, Flapple stores a highly corrosive acid capable of causing severe chemical burns, which it spits at its enemies before swooping in for the finish. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, Flapple is notable for its ability to **Gigantamax**, a transformation where it grows to a massive size and sits atop a nectar-filled giant apple, gaining access to the G-Max Move *G-Max Tartness*.

## Evolution & Biology
Flapple is part of a complex branching evolutionary line originating from **Applin**. It evolves from Applin when the Pokémon is exposed to a **Tart Apple** (typically found in the Galar region). It is a sister evolution to **Appletun** (who evolves via a Sweet Apple) and the more recently discovered **Dipplin** (who evolves via a Syrupy Apple in Kitakami and eventually becomes Hydrapple). Biologically, Flapple belongs to the **Plant and Dragon** Egg Groups. It has a hatch counter of 20, and its growth rate is unique, starting slow before becoming very fast at higher levels. It is perfectly adapted for aerial maneuvers despite its small size, using the weight of its apple-flesh wings to dive-bomb prey.
