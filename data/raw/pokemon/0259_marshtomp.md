## Identity & Lore
Marshtomp (Pokedex #259) is the dual-type Water/Ground Mud Fish Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Its body is enveloped in a thin, sticky film that allows it to live on land without drying out, though it prefers the water's edge. This Pokémon is known to play in mud on beaches when the ocean tide is low, using its sturdy hind legs to maintain stability on slippery surfaces. While Marshtomp does not possess a form change itself, it is the middle stage of the Hoenn Water starter line, eventually evolving into Swampert, which is capable of Mega Evolution.
