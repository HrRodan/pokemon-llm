## Identity & Lore
Regidrago (Pokedex #895) is the Dragon Orb Pokémon, a legendary entity first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII) within the Crown Tundra's Split-Decision Ruins. Composed of crystallized dragon energy, its body is primarily a spherical core, but its massive arms are theorized by scholars to be the actual skull of an ancient dragon Pokémon. According to Galar legend, the titan creator Regigigas attempted to fashion a Pokémon from crystallized dragon energy but ran out of materials, leaving Regidrago with only its head-like appendages. Despite its incomplete appearance, lore suggests that if it were ever truly finished, its power would be capable of destroying the world. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it stands as a peer to the original Hoenn titans (Regirock, Regice, and Registeel) and its electric counterpart, Regieleki.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 200, Attack 100, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 50, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** High-HP Mixed Wallbreaker. Despite its astronomical HP, its low defensive base stats make it vulnerable to powerful specialized attackers; however, its offensive presence is terrifying due to its signature ability.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It **resists Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its mixed offensive stats and unique signature move, key moves include **Dragon Energy** (an incredibly powerful special move that deals more damage the higher the user's HP), **Draco Meteor** (for maximum burst damage), **Earth Power** (to provide vital coverage against Steel and Rock types), and **Dragon Dance** (to boost its Speed and Physical Attack for a physical sweep setup).
* **Abilities:** Dragon's Maw (This unique ability provides a 50% power boost to all Dragon-type moves, effectively giving Regidrago an innate Choice Band/Specs effect for its primary STAB attacks).

## Evolution & Biology
Regidrago is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not part of a traditional evolutionary line. It is a member of the "Legendary Titans" group, sharing a biological connection to Regigigas, who is said to have pulled the continents into place and crafted the titans from various materials. Biologically, its body is a dense concentration of dragon energy so intense that other dragon Pokémon cannot even approach it. Because it is a legendary creature, it belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group and cannot be bred. In the wild, it remains dormant in ancient ruins until awakened by a trainer carrying the other three original titans.
