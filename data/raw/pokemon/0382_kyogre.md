## Identity & Lore
Kyogre (Pokédex #382) is the legendary **Sea Basin Pokémon**, a massive entity introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Residing in the deep sea, this blue, whale-like titan possesses the mythological power to create massive rain clouds that cover the entire sky, bringing about torrential downpours to expand the oceans. Lore describes Kyogre as a savior to people suffering from droughts, though its ancient rivalry with Groudon threatens to upset the balance of nature. While it does not evolve, Kyogre is capable of **Primal Reversion** when holding the Blue Orb, transforming into Primal Kyogre and reclaiming its prehistoric power. It is a member of the Weather Trio along with Groudon and Rayquaza.
