## Identity & Lore
Mudsdale (Pokedex #750) is the Draft Horse Pokémon, a powerful quadruped introduced in the Alola region (Generation VII). Standing at 2.5 meters and weighing a massive 920 kilograms, Mudsdale is renowned for its stoic nature and incredible physical stamina. Its body is covered in a protective layer of dried mud that is so durable and weather-resistant that Alolan ancestors traditionally used its spit to coat the walls of their houses against wind and rain. In the wild, it is known for its legendary silence; it rarely cries out, even when in pain, and can reduce a car to scrap metal with a single kick of its mud-caked hooves. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form, it is highly valued as a heavy-duty mount, famously utilized in the Alola Poké Ride system to traverse rocky, uneven terrain.
