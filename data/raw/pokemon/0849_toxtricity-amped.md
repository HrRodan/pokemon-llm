## Identity & Lore
Amped Form Toxtricity (#849) is the Punk Pokémon, a rebellious bipedal creature first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It is easily distinguished by its vibrant purple and yellow coloration and the rhythmic, guitar-like sounds it produces by clawing at the electrified protrusions on its chest. This electrical generation is not just for defense; it creates a melody that sounds like a strumming bass guitar, vibrating through its environment. While this profile focuses on the Amped Form, this species is known for its dimorphism, also appearing in a "Low Key" form depending on its temperament. In the Galar region, Toxtricity is capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, transforming into a massive entity that can create a giant guitar made of electricity to unleash the move G-Max Stun Shock.

It can also utilize **Shift Gear** to patch up its middling Speed and boost its physical Attack.

    * **Punk Rock:** Its signature ability, which boosts the power of sound-based moves by 30% and halves the damage Toxtricity takes from incoming sound moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Toxtricity is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Toxel** starting at **Level 30**. The specific form it takes—Amped or Low Key—is determined by the Pokémon's Nature; Toxel with Hardy, Brave, Adamant, Naughty, Docile, Impish, Lax, Timid, Hasty, Jolly, Naive, Modest, or Rash natures will always evolve into the **Amped Form**. Biologically, it is a high-energy organism that thrives on internal chemical reactions to produce high-voltage electricity. It belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 25, requiring significant effort from trainers to breed and raise from its baby stage.
