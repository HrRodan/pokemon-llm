## Identity & Lore
Mega Golurk (Pokedex #10313) is a massive, ancient Automaton Pokémon originally discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). As a Ground and Ghost-type construct, it is said to have been created by an ancient civilization to serve as a guardian for both people and Pokémon. This Mega-Evolved form pushes its internal energy to the absolute limit; according to lore, the seal on its chest acts as a restrictor, and removing or breaking it—as occurs during the volatile process of Mega Evolution—causes its spectral power to go out of control. Despite its hulking, green-hued metallic frame weighing 330.0 kg and standing 4.0 meters tall, Mega Golurk is capable of tucking its limbs into its body to fly across the sky at Mach speeds, transforming into a living, spectral missile.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 89, Attack 159, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 105, Speed 55.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Wallbreaker. Mega Golurk sacrifices speed for overwhelming physical power and significant dual-defensive bulk, making it a "Trick Room" specialist or a heavy-hitting tradesman.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, Ice, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses invaluable **immunities to Electric, Normal, and Fighting-type moves**, and **resists Poison, Rock, and Bug**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive 159 Attack stat, Mega Golurk excels with high-impact physical strikes. Key moves include **Earthquake** (primary Ground STAB), **Phantom Force** or **Poltergeist** (spectral offensive pressure), **Drain Punch** (providing much-needed longevity and recovery), and **Ice Punch** or **Heavy Slam** (for essential type coverage against Flying or Fairy types).
* **Abilities:** While its Mega-specific ability is often associated with its base forms' traits, it typically utilizes **Iron Fist** to boost the power of punching moves or **No Guard** to ensure its heavy-hitting attacks never miss, though the volatile nature of Mega Evolution suggests an amplification of its internal energy output.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Golurk is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary progression. It begins its life as **Golett**, a small clay construct. Golett evolves into the standard **Golurk** upon reaching **Level 43**. The transition into its Mega Form is a temporary state triggered by the presence of a specific Mega Stone, which unlocks the ancient machinery's full potential. Biologically, it is a genderless entity belonging to the **Mineral** egg group. Its construction is primarily composed of an unknown ancient material that glows with a mysterious green light when its internal energy source is activated.
