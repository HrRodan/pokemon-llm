## Identity & Lore
Mega Absol (Pokedex #10057) is the Disaster Pokémon, a sleek and formidable quadrupedal form originally discovered in the Hoenn region (Generation III). When Absol undergoes Mega Evolution, its fur flares out around its neck and back, creating the appearance of wings, though it remains incapable of true flight. This transformation surges the Pokémon with an overflow of energy, sharpening its innate ability to sense subtle shifts in the environment. Historically misunderstood as the cause of natural disasters such as earthquakes and tidal waves, Absol actually appears to warn humans of impending peril. While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, this Mega Evolution represents the peak of its predatory elegance and misunderstood heroism.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Absol is the Mega Evolved state of Absol. While Absol does not evolve into or from any other species in a traditional three-stage line, it achieves this form through the use of an **Absolite** Mega Stone during battle. Biologically, it is a mountain-dwelling creature that belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. It has a relatively slow maturation process, indicated by its medium-slow growth rate and a hatch counter of 25. Its white fur and scythe-like tail are iconic markers of its presence in high-altitude habitats.
