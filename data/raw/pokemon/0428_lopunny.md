## Identity & Lore
Lopunny (Pokedex #428) is the Rabbit Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Primarily recognized by its brown fur and cream-colored accents, this upright creature is extremely cautious by nature.

Although not strictly a regional variant, Lopunny is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Lopunny, gaining the Fighting type and a significant boost in offensive capabilities.
