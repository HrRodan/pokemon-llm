## Identity & Lore
Poltchageist (Pokedex #1012) is the Matcha Pokémon, a unique Grass and Ghost-type creature first discovered in the land of Kitakami during the Generation IX (Paldea) era. This Pokémon is said to be the physical manifestation of the lingering regrets of a tea ceremony master who passed away before perfecting his craft; these regrets possessed a jar of matcha powder to create Poltchageist. While it bears a striking resemblance to Sinistea, it is actually a **convergent species**, meaning it evolved independently to fill a similar niche. 

Poltchageist is famous for its two distinct variations: the **Counterfeit Form** and the rare **Artisan Form**. The Artisan Form can be identified by a small stamp of authenticity on the bottom of its container, reflecting its origin in genuine, antique tea-ware. Though it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved state, Sinistcha, shares its unique "tea" biology and signature traits. In its natural habitat, it is known to haunt old houses and may even use its matcha-like powder to repair broken objects, though those who drink its tea may find their vitality drained.

## Evolution & Biology
Poltchageist is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Sinistcha** through a unique item-based trigger. If it is in its Counterfeit Form, it requires an **Unremarkable Teacup** to evolve; if it is in its rare Artisan Form, it requires a **Masterpiece Teacup**. It belongs to the **Mineral** and **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** Egg Groups. Its biology is centered around its tea-like essence, which it can manipulate to drain life force or inflict status conditions like sleep using **Stun Spore** or **Sleep Talk**. Despite its small stature (0.1m), it is a sophisticated spirit that thrives in structured, traditional environments.
