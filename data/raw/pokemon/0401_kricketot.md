## Identity & Lore
Kricketot (Pokedex #401) is the Cricket Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Distinguished by its reddish coloration and humanoid shape, this Bug-type is famous for the musical qualities of its biology. It lacks the vocal cords to produce sound in traditional ways; instead, it communicates by shaking its head back and front, causing its antennae to strike each other and resonate like a xylophone. These melodic sounds are often heard during autumn nights. Kricketot is generally clumsy; when it stumbles, its antennae often clatter together, creating a rhythmic chime. While it possesses a **Metronome** as a potential held item in the wild—reinforcing its musical theme—it does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 37, Attack 25, Defense 41, Sp. Atk 25, Sp. Def 41, Speed 25.
* **Archetype:** Early-Game Defensive Support.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Bug-type, it is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Fire**. It offers defensive **resistances to Fighting, Grass, and Ground** types.
* **Move Selection:** Due to its extremely low offensive stats (both Base 25), Kricketot relies on STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and utility. Its best loadout includes **Bug Bite** (Physical STAB with Berry-eating utility), **Struggle Bug** (Special STAB that lowers the opponent's Sp. Atk), **Endeavor** (to capitalize on its low HP to damage stronger foes), and **String Shot** (to lower opponent Speed).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Shed Skin:** At the end of each turn, the Pokémon has a 30% chance to heal any non-volatile status condition (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, Poison, Freeze), providing distinctive durability.
    *   **Run Away (Hidden):** Enables a guaranteed escape from wild battles, regardless of the opponent's speed or trapping moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Kricketot is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Kricketune** strictly when it reaches **Level 10**, undergoing a metamorphosis that significantly enhances its musical capabilities and offensive presence. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
