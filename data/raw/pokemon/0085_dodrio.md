## Identity & Lore
Dodrio (Pokedex #085) is the Triple Bird Pokémon, a prominent avian species native to the grasslands of the **Kanto** region (Generation I). This brown, long-legged runner is distinguished by its three heads, which biologically function with independent brains to execute complex collaborative strategies. Lore suggests that each head represents a distinct emotion—joy, sorrow, and anger—and to ensure constant vigilance, they utilize an alternating sleep cycle where at least one head remains awake at all times. Despite lacking functional wings for sustained flight, Dodrio utilizes its powerful legs to achieve high-speed terrestrial movement across the plains.
