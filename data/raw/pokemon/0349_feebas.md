## Identity & Lore
Feebas (Pokedex #349) is the Fish Pokémon, notorious for its ragged fins and generally "shoddy" appearance. Introduced in Generation III (Hoenn), this brown, tattered creature is often ignored by researchers and trainers alike due to its lack of aesthetic appeal, serving as a direct parallel to the weak Magikarp. Despite its frail look, Feebas is remarkably hardy and capable of surviving in both the sea and polluted rivers, often nibbling on algae at the water's edge. In lore, it is famous for its extreme rarity in the wild (originally appearing on only six random water tiles) and its potential to undergo a dramatic metamorphosis into one of the most beautiful Pokémon in existence.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 20, Attack 15, Defense 20, Sp. Atk 10, Sp. Def 55, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility / Niche Disruptor.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water** type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** While its offensive stats are negligible, Feebas has a surprisingly wide support pool. Utilizing its high Speed (for an unevolved Pokémon) and moderate Special Defense, key moves include:
    *   **Scald:** The primary offensive tool, chosen not for damage, but for its high chance to Burn the opponent, compensating for Feebas's low Defense.
    *   **Mirror Coat:** A tactical move that allows Feebas to survive a special attack (using its 55 Sp. Def) and return double the damage.
    *   **Haze:** A critical utility move to reset an opponent's stat boosts.
    *   **Hypnosis:** Capitalizes on Feebas's 80 Base Speed to put opponents to sleep before they can act.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat when it is raining.
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from being infatuated or falling for Taunt (crucial for ensuring utility moves land).
    *   **Adaptability (Hidden):** Increases the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) from 1.5x to 2x, though rarely useful due to Feebas's low offensive power.

## Evolution & Biology
Feebas is the first stage of a famous 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Milotic** through two distinct methods depending on the game generation:
1.  **Level Up with High Beauty:** Historically, Feebas evolves when leveled up after its **Beauty** condition has been maxed out (via Pokéblocks or Poffins).
2.  **Trade Evolution:** In newer generations, it evolves when **traded while holding a Prism Scale**.
Feebas belongs to the **Water 1** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. It has a fluctuating growth rate described as "Slow-Then-Very-Fast," making it difficult to raise initially but rapid to level up at later stages.
