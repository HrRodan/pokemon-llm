## Identity & Lore
Kartana (Pokedex #798) is the Drawn Sword Pokémon, a mysterious and extradimensional entity known as an Ultra Beast, specifically codenamed UB-04 Blade. First appearing in the Alola region during Generation VII, Kartana arrived through the Ultra Wormhole from the Ultra Forest. Despite its diminutive stature—standing only 0.3 meters tall and weighing a mere 0.1 kilograms—its entire body is composed of thin, paper-like membranes that are sharpened to a molecular edge, capable of cutting through steel and giant trees with a single stroke. Its white and orange aesthetic resembles traditional origami, masking its nature as a lethal living weapon. While it does not appear to possess a malicious nature, its sheer sharpness makes it hazardous to anything in its vicinity. As an Ultra Beast, it shares thematic ties with other "sub-legendary" entities from Ultra Space but does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 59, Attack 181, Defense 131, Sp. Atk 59, Sp. Def 31, Speed 109.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Wallbreaker. With a staggering base 181 Attack—one of the highest of all non-Mega evolved Pokémon—Kartana functions as a premier offensive threat that can dismantle defensive cores.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a Grass/Steel type, which provides a massive array of resistances. It is **weak to Fighting** and suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Fire**. Conversely, it is **immune to Poison** and **resists** Normal, Water, Electric, Grass (quad-resist), Psychic, Rock, Dragon, Steel, and Fairy types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive Attack and respectable Speed, Kartana excels with a physical moveset: **Leaf Blade** (high crit-ratio STAB), **Sacred Sword** (ignores opponent's stat changes), **Smart Strike** (guaranteed hit STAB), and **Knock Off** (for essential utility and coverage). **Swords Dance** is also a vital option to reach astronomical damage levels.
* **Abilities:** Beast Boost (Automatically raises the Pokémon’s most proficient stat—nearly always its Attack—by one stage each time it knocks out an opponent, allowing Kartana to snowball into an unstoppable sweeper).

## Evolution & Biology
Kartana is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. As an Ultra Beast, it belongs to the "No Eggs Discovered" Egg Group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biological makeup is unique; it is extremely light and fragile on the special side (evidenced by its critically low Special Defense), yet its physical structure is dense enough to provide high Physical Defense. It has a slow growth rate and is famously difficult to capture, requiring specialized Beast Balls to effectively contain its interdimensional energy.
