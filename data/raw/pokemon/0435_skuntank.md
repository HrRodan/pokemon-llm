## Identity & Lore
Skuntank (Pokedex #435) is the purple-furred Skunk Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A notorious biological hazard, this quadrupedal mammal is capable of spraying a vile-smelling fluid from the tip of its tail with a range of over 160 feet. The stench of this secretion is so potent that it creates an area denial effect in its habitat. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Skuntank is well-known in Sinnoh lore as a signature Pokémon of Team Galactic Commander Jupiter.

It also effectively utilizes utility moves like **Defog** and **Memento**.

## Evolution & Biology
Skuntank is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Stunky** upon reaching **Level 34**. It belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group. Biologically, the foul fluid it sprays is secreted from its rear, and it lifts its tail over its head to aim the spray forward, resembling a turret.
