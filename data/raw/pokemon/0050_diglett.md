## Identity & Lore
Diglett (Pokedex #050) is the Ground-type Mole Pokémon originating from Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its small, brown, blob-like appearance emerging from the soil, Diglett lives approximately one yard underground where it feeds on plant roots. It prefers dark, cave habitats and avoids bright sunlight due to its thin skin, which heats up easily. A subject of great mystery within the Pokémon world is the fact that its lower body has never been seen, fueling various theories about its true anatomy. While this profile details the standard form, a regional variant exists: the **Alolan Diglett**, which possesses the Steel/Ground typing and features hair-like metallic whiskers.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 10, Attack 55, Defense 25, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 45, Speed 95.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Trapper / Glass Cannon.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ground-type, it is **weak to Water, Grass, and Ice**. It **resists Poison and Rock** and possesses a total **immunity to Electric-type** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high speed and physical attack, its optimal moveset includes **Earthquake** (high-power STAB), **Sucker Punch** (priority coverage), **Stone Edge** (to hit Flying-types), and **Stealth Rock** (entry hazard utility). Alternatively, **Memento** is a key utility move for sacrificing itself to cripple opponents.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sand Veil:** Boosts the Pokémon's evasion in a sandstorm.
    *   **Arena Trap:** Prevents opposing Pokémon from fleeing or switching out (unless they are Flying-type or have Levitate), making Diglett a dangerous revenge killer.
    *   **Sand Force (Hidden):** Boosts the power of Rock, Ground, and Steel-type moves in a sandstorm.

## Evolution & Biology
Diglett is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dugtrio** starting at **Level 26**. Upon evolution, it appears to triple in number, though lore suggests it is a single body with three heads acting in unison. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and has a medium growth rate. Its design draws inspiration from the game *Whac-A-Mole*, and it is notably one of the lightest Pokémon in existence at only 0.8 kg.
