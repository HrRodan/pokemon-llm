## Identity & Lore
Urshifu Rapid Strike G-Max (Pokedex #10227) is the Gigantamax manifestation of the Wushu Pokémon's fluid combat style. This Legendary Pokémon, hailing from the Galar region (Generation VIII), represents the pinnacle of training on the Isle of Armor. While its base form is already a master of the "Rapid Strike Style," this Gigantamax form embodies the relentless power of a rushing river. In this state, Urshifu grows to a towering 26 meters, draped in a blue-tinted aura that symbolizes its Water/Fighting dual-typing. Lore states that a Gigantamax Urshifu in its Rapid Strike form maintains a calm, flowing posture that masks its ability to unleash a torrential flurry of strikes. Unlike its Single Strike counterpart that favors one-hit KOs, the Rapid Strike variant focuses on overwhelming the opponent with multi-hit precision and speed.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 130, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 63, Sp. Def 60, Speed 97.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Psychic, Fairy, Grass, and Electric**. It possesses a strong defensive profile, **resisting Steel, Fire, Water, Ice, Bug, Rock, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its massive 130 Base Attack, Urshifu-Rapid-Strike utilizes moves that bypass defensive checks. Key moves include its signature **Surging Strikes** (a triple-hit Water move that always results in a critical hit), **Close Combat** for massive Fighting-type STAB damage, **Aqua Jet** for priority finishing, and **U-turn** for tactical pivoting. In its Gigantamax form, it gains access to the exclusive move **G-Max Rapid Flow**, which strikes through the opponent's "Protect" and "Detect" abilities.
* **Abilities:** **Unseen Fist** (This unique ability allows Urshifu's contact moves to deal full damage even if the target has used defensive moves like Protect, Detect, or Spiky Shield).

## Evolution & Biology
Urshifu Rapid Strike G-Max is the final evolutionary stage of a two-stage legendary line. It evolves from the small, earnest **Kubfu** through a unique ritual within the **Tower of Waters** located in the Isle of Armor. Once Kubfu views the Scroll of Waters, it undergoes a permanent stylistic evolution into the Rapid Strike Style Urshifu. The Gigantamax form is achieved when an Urshifu with the Gigantamax Factor consumes Max Soup enriched with Max Honey. As a Legendary Pokémon, it belongs to the **No-Eggs** group and cannot be bred. Despite its humanoid appearance and gray coloration, it is biologically designed for "slow" growth, reflecting the intense and patient training required to master its wushu-inspired martial arts.
