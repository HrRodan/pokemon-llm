## Identity & Lore
Tandemaus (#924) is the Couple Pokémon, a unique Normal-type species introduced in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This Pokémon consists of two small, white, mouse-like creatures that are never seen apart, acting in such perfect synchronicity that they are treated as a single entity. They exhibit incredible teamwork, using their sharp incisors to cut through various materials to gather supplies for their nests. Despite their minimalist, doll-like appearance and white coloration, they are industrious workers within their habitat. While Tandemaus does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox counterparts, its evolved form, Maushold, is famous for its "Family of Three" and "Family of Four" variations, which represent one of the most unique biological progressions in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile

* **Abilities:** **Run Away** (ensures a certain escape from wild encounters); **Pickup** (allows the Pokémon to occasionally find items outside of battle or during a turn if it isn't holding an item); **Own Tempo** (Hidden Ability: grants immunity to confusion and protects the Pokémon from the effects of the Intimidate ability).

## Evolution & Biology
Tandemaus is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Maushold starting at Level 25. A distinct biological quirk of this Pokémon is its evolution method; it often evolves "automatically" while in the party without the player viewing the traditional evolution screen, reflecting the sudden appearance of additional "children" in the group. Tandemaus belongs to the Ground and Fairy Egg Groups, indicating its versatility in breeding. Despite its small stature—standing only 0.3 meters tall—its industrious nature and fast growth rate make it a resilient survivor in the Paldean wilds.
