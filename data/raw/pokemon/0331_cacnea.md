## Identity & Lore
Cacnea (Pokedex #331) is the Cactus Pokémon, a Grass-type originally discovered in the arid deserts of the Hoenn region (Generation III). Resembling a green, humanoid cactus with a yellow flower atop its head, Cacnea is deceptively predatory. It thrives in harsh, rough-terrain environments where water is scarce. Biologically, it has evolved a unique hunting mechanism: it releases a strong, heady aroma from its flower to allure prey. Once the victim is within range, Cacnea expels sharp thorns from its body to subdue them, utilizing moves like **Pin Missile**. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its biology allows it to retain water efficiently, making it perfectly adapted to sandstorm conditions.

## Evolution & Biology
Cacnea is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Cacturne** when it is leveled up to **Level 32**. In the wild, it is occasionally found holding a **Poison Barb** or **Sticky Barb**. It belongs to the **Plant** and **Human-Like** Egg Groups, allowing for diverse breeding combinations with human-shaped Pokémon. Its growth rate is medium-slow, requiring patience to raise to maturity.
