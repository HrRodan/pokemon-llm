## Identity & Lore
Iron Moth (Pokedex #994) is the Paradox Pokémon, a mechanical enigma first discovered in the Paldea region during the Generation IX expedition into Area Zero. It is a dual Fire and Poison-type entity that bears a striking, futuristic resemblance to the contemporary Pokémon Volcarona. According to paranormal publications like the Occulture magazine, this being is described as a UFO sent to observe humanity, though its true origins remain a mystery of the Great Crater. Its body is composed of metallic, segmented plates and glowing wings that emit intense thermal energy. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it belongs to the exclusive "Future Paradox" group, characterized by its chrome-like finish and reliance on advanced energy sources.

## Evolution & Biology
Iron Moth is a standalone Paradox Pokémon and is not part of a traditional evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. Despite its biological similarity to the Larvesta and Volcarona lineage, it is considered a distinct species found only in the depths of the Great Crater of Paldea. Biologically, it is genderless and belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its high hatch counter of 50 reflects its status as a rare and powerful late-game encounter. In competitive environments, it is often utilized as a powerful wallbreaker capable of pivoting with moves like **U-turn** or setting hazards such as **Toxic Spikes**.
