## Identity & Lore
Vikavolt (Pokedex #738) is the Stag Beetle Pokémon, a formidable Bug and Electric-type creature first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This sleek, blue-colored Pokémon is known for its incredible aerial maneuverability, zipping through forests and mountain ranges on the lookout for openings to strike. It possesses massive, specialized jaws that function as powerful electrical conductors, concentrating energy to blast enemies with high-voltage zaps. While it does not currently have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Vikavolt is famously recognized for its role as a Totem Pokémon in the Lush Jungle of the Alola region. Its design reflects a fusion of a stag beetle and a futuristic fighter jet, fitting its habitat in rugged areas like Vast Poni Canyon and Blush Mountain.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 77, Attack 70, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 145, Sp. Def 75, Speed 43.
* **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker / Trick Room Sweeper. With a staggering base Special Attack of 145, Vikavolt hits harder than many Legendary Pokémon, though its low Speed requires team support or Trick Room to be effective.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire and Rock**. It notably **resists Grass, Fighting, Steel, and Electric**. Due to its ability, it possesses a functional **immunity to Ground**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Thunderbolt** for heavy STAB damage, **Bug Buzz** to bypass Substitutes, **Volt Switch** for offensive pivoting, and **Energy Ball** to provide critical coverage against the Rock and Ground-types that might threaten it. It is also a premier setter of **Sticky Web** for team speed control.
* **Abilities:** Levitate (Gives full immunity to all Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, effectively removing one of the primary weaknesses of Electric types).

## Evolution & Biology
Vikavolt is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Grubbin**, which evolves into the battery-like **Charjabug** starting at Level 20. To reach its final form as Vikavolt, Charjabug must be **leveled up within a special magnetic field** (such as Vast Poni Canyon in Alola or Mt. Coronet in Sinnoh) or, in more recent regions, it evolves when **exposed to a Thunder Stone**. Biologically, Vikavolt often carries Charjabug with its legs to use them as extra batteries, discarding them to regain mobility if a mid-air dogfight becomes intense. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group and is known for its relatively fast development cycle, despite its high power ceiling.
