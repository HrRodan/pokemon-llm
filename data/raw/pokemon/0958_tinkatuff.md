## Identity & Lore
Tinkatuff (Pokedex #958) is the Hammer Pokémon, a spirited and competitive creature originating from the Paldea region in Generation IX. This pink, humanoid Pokémon is defined by its industrious and aggressive nature, spending its time inhabiting wilderness areas where it hunts groups of Pawniard and Bisharp. It does this not for food, but to scavenge high-quality metal to forge and enlarge its signature handheld hammer. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolutionary potential culminates in Tinkaton, a formidable Pokémon known for wielding a massive, 220-pound hammer capable of knocking Corviknight out of the sky. Tinkatuff's biology is a blend of fairy-like whimsy and steel-clad determination, making it a unique inhabitant of the Paldean ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 55, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 82, Speed 78.
* **Archetype:** Special Defensive Utility / Disruptor. While its offensive stats are modest as a middle-stage evolution, its Speed and Special Defense allow it to function as a pivot or support specialist.
* **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Fairy/Steel** type, it possesses one of the strongest defensive combinations in the game. It is **weak to Ground and Fire**. Conversely, it **resists** a vast array of types including Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Rock, and Dark. It also boasts complete **immunity to Poison and Dragon** type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its physical Attack and high utility pool, Tinkatuff excels with **Play Rough** for heavy STAB damage, **Knock Off** for removing enemy items, **Fake Out** for immediate flinch pressure upon entering battle, and **Thunder Wave** to provide speed control for its team.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Mold Breaker:** Allows Tinkatuff to ignore the effects of an opponent's defensive abilities (such as hitting through Levitate or Sturdy).
    * **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused and provides immunity to the Intimidate ability.
    * **Pickpocket (Hidden):** Steals an opponent's held item when Tinkatuff is hit by a contact move.

## Evolution & Biology
Tinkatuff is the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Tinkatink** starting at **Level 24**. After gaining sufficient combat experience and metal-working skill, it evolves into the powerful **Tinkaton** starting at **Level 38**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group and has a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant investment to reach its final form. Its pink coloration and humanoid shape contrast with the rugged, metallic hammer it carries, which serves as both its primary tool for survival and its main weapon in the competitive Paldean wild.
