## Identity & Lore
Gardevoir (Pokedex #282) is the Psychic/Fairy-type Embrace Pokémon, first introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling an elegant humanoid figure clad in flowing white drapery, it is known for its immense loyalty and devotion to its trainer. Gardevoir possesses the ability to read the future and sense impending danger; if its trainer is threatened, it unleashes its psychokinetic energy at full power, a force reportedly strong enough to distort dimensions and create small black holes. While typically found in urban settings, it is a rare sight due to its protective nature. Notably, Gardevoir is capable of Mega Evolution into **Mega Gardevoir** using the Gardevoirite, which grants it the Pixilate ability and a massive boost to its offensive capabilities.

It shares this lineage with the Fighting/Psychic-type **Gallade**, which Kirlia evolves into only if it is male and exposed to a **Dawn Stone**. Gardevoir belongs to the **Humanshape** and **Indeterminate** Egg Groups, often requiring a high degree of friendship or care to reach its full potential.
