## Identity & Lore
Blacephalon (Pokedex #806) is the Fireworks Pokémon, a colorful and enigmatic entity first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This otherworldly creature is classified as an Ultra Beast, specifically known by the code name UB Burst. Standing 1.8 meters tall and weighing only 13 kilograms, its humanoid, white-colored body is composed of a collection of flickering sparks and vibrant spots. It is known for its chillingly playful behavior, slithering toward unsuspecting targets before suddenly triggering a massive explosion of its own head—which is actually a collection of small sparks—to startle and consume the energy of its victims. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as an Ultra Beast marks it as a high-threat interdimensional traveler that originates from Ultra Space, specifically appearing through Ultra Wormholes.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 53, Attack 127, Defense 53, Sp. Atk 151, Sp. Def 79, Speed 107.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Glass Cannon / Fast Special Sweeper. While it has a surprisingly high Attack stat, its gargantuan Special Attack makes it one of the most terrifying special threats in the competitive circuit.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Rock, Water, Ghost, and Dark**. Conversely, it **resists Fire, Grass, Ice, Poison, Steel, and Fairy**, has a **double resistance (0.25x) to Bug**, and is **immune to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Special Attack and its signature explosive nature, key moves include its signature move **Mind Blown** (a massive Fire-type explosion that deals recoil damage), **Shadow Ball** for consistent Ghost-type STAB, **Fire Blast** for heavy Fire damage without the recoil of its signature move, and **Psyshock** to bypass specially defensive walls by hitting their physical Defense.
* **Abilities:** Beast Boost (Automatically increases the Pokémon’s most proficient stat—usually Special Attack—each time it knocks out an opposing Pokémon, allowing it to snowball into an unstoppable sweeper).

## Evolution & Biology
Blacephalon is a single-stage Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. As an Ultra Beast, its biological makeup differs significantly from terrestrial Pokémon, resulting in its placement in the "No Eggs" group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. It has a "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Its biology is centered around its detachable head, which it can regenerate at will after using it as a projectile. Despite its festive, clown-like appearance, its lack of empathy and predatory habit of "blasting" its opponents makes it a dangerous encounter for any trainer in the Alolan wilds or Ultra Deep Sea.
