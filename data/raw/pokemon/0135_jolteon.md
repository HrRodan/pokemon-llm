## Identity & Lore
Jolteon (Pokédex #135) is the Lightning Pokémon, a pure Electric-type introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This quadrupedal, yellow Pokémon is easily recognized by its spiky, needle-like fur which stands on end when it accumulates electricity. According to biological research, Jolteon generates power by gathering negative ions from the atmosphere, capable of blasting 10,000-volt lightning bolts. It prefers **urban** habitats and is known for its high-strung, volatile nature; its mood changes easily, often accompanied by the crackling of electricity. While Jolteon does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it remains one of the most agile and popular members of the "Eeveelution" family due to its raw speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Jolteon is part of a 2-stage, multi-branched evolutionary line originating from **Eevee**. It evolves from Eevee specifically when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It is one of eight potential final forms for Eevee. Jolteon belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 35 egg cycles. Its distinct biology allows its fur to sharpen into needles, which it can fire like missiles (Pin Missile) when threatened or agitated.
