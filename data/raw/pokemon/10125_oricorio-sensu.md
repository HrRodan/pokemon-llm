## Identity & Lore
Sensu Style Oricorio (Pokedex #10125) is the Ghost- and Flying-type variant of the Dancing Pokémon, originally discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This specific form is native to Poni Island, where it gathers Purple Nectar to transform its appearance and spiritual essence. Sensu Style Oricorio is characterized by its elegant, fan-like wings and a rhythmic, traditional dance style that allows it to summon the dead to lend their power to its performance. Unlike many other species, Oricorio does not have a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart; instead, it possesses the unique biological ability to shift between four distinct styles (Baile, Pom-Pom, Pa’u, and Sensu) depending on the nectar it consumes. Its plumage is a deep purple, reflecting its calm yet haunting nature as it bathes opponents in cursed spirits through its graceful movements.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 70, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 98, Sp. Def 70, Speed 93.
* **Archetype:** Special Setup Sweeper. With access to one of the best setup moves in the game and a respectable Speed tier, it functions as a potent threat in mid-game transitions.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, Ice, Ghost, and Dark**. It possesses a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Bug** and is completely **immune to Normal, Fighting, and Ground** types, providing it with many safe opportunities to switch in.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack and setup potential, its optimal moveset includes **Revelation Dance** (which becomes Ghost-type in this form), **Hurricane** for high-power STAB, **Quiver Dance** to boost Speed and Special stats, and **Roost** for reliable recovery to maintain longevity.
* **Abilities:** Dancer (The Pokémon's signature ability. Whenever another Pokémon uses a dance move—such as Dragon Dance, Quiver Dance, or Fiery Dance—Oricorio immediately follows up with the same move, allowing it to "hitchhike" on the opponent's or ally's momentum).

## Evolution & Biology
Oricorio is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve into or from any other species; however, it undergoes a form change based on environmental stimuli. To obtain the Sensu Style, Oricorio must be exposed to **Purple Nectar**, which is typically found in the Poni Meadow of Alola. This change is reversible by consuming other nectars (Red, Yellow, or Pink). Biologically, it belongs to the **Flying** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20. It is often found carrying **Honey**, a testament to its diet of nectar which fuels its constant dancing. While its base stats remain the same across all forms, its primary typing and its signature move, Revelation Dance, adapt to match the spiritual energy of the Sensu form.
