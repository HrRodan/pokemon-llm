## Identity & Lore
Croagunk (Pokedex #453) is the Toxic Mouth Pokémon, a unique amphibian originally discovered in the **Sinnoh region** (Generation IV). Characterized by its **blue** skin and humanoid shape, Croagunk possesses distinct poison sacs in its cheeks which can emit an eerie, distracting sound. While not physically imposing, it is known for its underhanded tactics; it creates openings by catching foes off guard before jabbing them with its toxic fingers. This Pokémon is often found in damp environments and holds a notable cultural significance in Pastoria City.
