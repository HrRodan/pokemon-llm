## Identity & Lore
Minior (Pokedex #10132), specifically in its Green Meteor Form, is the Meteor Pokémon originating from the Alola region of Generation VII. This celestial being is primarily composed of a stony, brown outer shell that protects a vibrant, green core. Originally making its home in the ozone layer, Minior survives by consuming dust particles; once it has consumed enough material to become heavy, it hurtles toward the earth’s surface as a falling star. While this specific iteration is the Green Core variant, Minior is famous for appearing in seven different colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet), all of which remain hidden behind their rocky carapaces until their health is depleted. Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique physiological ability to shed its shell represents one of the most dramatic mid-battle transformations in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 60, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 100, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Setup Sweeper. In its Meteor Form, Minior functions as a tanky shell designed to survive hits while preparing for a devastating counter-attack.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Rock/Flying type, it is **weak to Water, Grass, Electric, Ice, Rock, and Steel**. It possesses a vital **immunity to Ground** and resists **Normal, Fire, Poison, Bug, and Flying** types. 
* **Move Selection:** Minior's strategy revolves around its signature setup. Key moves include **Shell Smash** (to double its offensive presence), **Power Gem** (special Rock-type STAB), **Acrobatics** (which doubles in power once its held item is consumed), and **Meteor Beam** (a high-damage charge move that boosts Special Attack).
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon is protected by a shell while above 50% HP, preventing status conditions and providing high defensive stats. When HP drops below half, the shell breaks, transforming Minior into its Core Form, which drastically increases its Speed and offensive stats while lowering its Defenses).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve into or from any other species; however, it undergoes a significant biological transformation through its **Shields Down** ability. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and is genderless, making it a unique specimen for breeders. In its Meteor Form, it weighs 40.0 kg, but upon losing its shell, its weight drops significantly, allowing for high-speed maneuvers. It is often found with the held item **Star Piece**, a reflection of its cosmic origins. When its shell breaks, the green core is revealed, which is said to be a beautiful, translucent material that glows with energy absorbed from the stratosphere.
