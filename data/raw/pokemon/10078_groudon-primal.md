## Identity & Lore
Primal Groudon (Pokedex #10078) is the Primal form of Groudon, the legendary Continent Pokémon originally discovered in the Hoenn region (Generation III). Described in ancient mythology as the primordial force that raised the lands and expanded the world's continents, this form represents Groudon’s true power restored by the energy of nature. While the base form is a pure Ground-type, Primal Reversion—triggered by the Red Orb—reawakens its ancient Fire-type attributes. Standing at a massive 5.0 meters and weighing nearly 1,000 kilograms, it is one of the heaviest Pokémon in existence. After a cataclysmic battle with its rival, Primal Kyogre, it was said to have retreated into a deep slumber within the Earth's mantle. While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Primal Reversion serves as a mechanical equivalent to Mega Evolution, granting it a significant surge in power and a permanent weather change.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 180, Defense 160, Sp. Atk 150, Sp. Def 90, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Primal Wallbreaker / Physical Tank. Its astronomical Attack and Special Attack make it a devastating mixed threat, while its massive physical Defense allows it to withstand almost any non-supereffective physical blow.
* **Type Matchups:** It is a Ground/Fire-type. Under normal conditions, it has a **Double Weakness (4x) to Water** and a weakness to Ground. However, its signature ability effectively removes its Water weakness entirely. It **resists** Fire, Grass, Ice, Poison, Bug, Steel, and Fairy, and it is **immune to Electric** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive offensive stats, Primal Groudon excels with **Precipice Blades** (a high-power physical Ground STAB), **Eruption** (a Special Fire STAB that deals massive damage at full HP), **Fire Blast** (consistent special Fire damage), and **Stone Edge** (to cover Flying-type switch-ins).
* **Abilities:** Desolate Land (The Pokémon changes the weather to "Extremely Harsh Sunlight" upon entering battle. This weather remains as long as the Pokémon is active, boosting Fire-type moves and causing all Water-type attacks to evaporate and fail completely).

## Evolution & Biology
Primal Groudon does not belong to a traditional evolutionary line. It is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon. Primal Reversion occurs instantly when a Groudon holding the Red Orb enters the battlefield, transforming it from its standard red form into its Primal state, characterized by glowing magma-like patterns on its skin. As a legendary entity, it belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) group and cannot be bred. It has a very slow growth rate and requires a high hatch counter of 120 (30,840 steps) to hatch in the rare event of obtaining an egg through special events. It is naturally found in rough terrain and deep volcanic environments.
