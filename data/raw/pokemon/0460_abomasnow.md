## Identity & Lore
Abomasnow (Pokedex #460) is the Frost Tree Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Ice creature introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. This massive, bipedal entity resembles the legendary abominable snowman, covered in shaggy white fur and green evergreen branches. It dwells in mountains that are perpetually buried in snow, where it is known to whip up intense blizzards to conceal its presence. While it typically lives quietly in isolation, it wields the power of nature to strike with the force of an avalanche. In battle lore, Abomasnow is renowned for its ability to undergo **Mega Evolution** into Mega Abomasnow when holding the Abomasite.
