## Identity & Lore
Kubfu (Pokedex #891) is the Wushu Pokémon, a small but exceptionally determined legendary Pokémon first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Standing at only 0.6 meters, this gray, bear-like martial artist is characterized by the white head-band-like fur and its disciplined nature. Found primarily on the Isle of Armor, Kubfu is known to train its heart and mind diligently to perfect its fighting style. Its flavor text emphasizes that its future is not set in stone; the specific training it undergoes and the moves it masters dictate which form it will take upon evolution. While Kubfu itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, its evolved form, Urshifu, is famous for possessing two distinct Gigantamax forms (Single Strike and Rapid Strike), making Kubfu the essential foundation for a Tier-1 competitive powerhouse.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 90, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 53, Sp. Def 50, Speed 72.
* **Archetype:** Physical Setup Attacker. With a respectable base Attack of 90 for a Pokémon in its base stage, Kubfu functions as a proactive combatant that relies on physical pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, Kubfu is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy** moves. It compensates by providing **resistances to Bug, Rock, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Physical Attack and setup potential, key moves for Kubfu include **Close Combat** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Iron Head** for coverage against Fairy-types, **Zen Headbutt** to handle poison-type threats, and **Swords Dance** to drastically boost its offensive presence. It also has access to **U-turn** for pivoting and tactical repositioning.
* **Abilities:** Inner Focus (Prevents the Pokémon from flinching. In recent generations, this ability also provides immunity to the Attack-lowering effects of the Intimidate ability, making Kubfu a consistent physical threat regardless of the opponent's presence).

## Evolution & Biology
Kubfu is part of a two-stage legendary evolutionary line and is unique for being a Legendary Pokémon capable of evolving. It evolves into Urshifu through a branching path determined by its training location. If it completes the challenge of the **Tower of Darkness**, it evolves into Urshifu (Single Strike Style, Fighting/Dark). If it completes the **Tower of Waters**, it evolves into Urshifu (Rapid Strike Style, Fighting/Water). Biologically, Kubfu belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. It has a **Slow** growth rate, reflecting the intense and lengthy training required to master its martial arts, and a high hatch counter of 120, further signifying its status as a rare and significant legendary species.
