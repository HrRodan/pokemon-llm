## Identity & Lore
Snom (#872) is the Worm Pokémon, a small Larval creature first discovered in the Galar region of Generation VIII. This white, translucent Pokémon is known for its remarkable survival strategy in frigid environments: it consumes snow that has piled up on the ground, and the more snow it eats, the larger and more impressive the internal icicle-like spikes on its back grow. Snom is biologically driven to disguise itself; it spits out thread imbued with a frigid sort of energy and uses it to tie its body to branches, perfectly mimicking an icicle while it sleeps to avoid predators. While Snom itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Frosmoth, is often regarded as a beautiful counterpart to Volcarona and is a staple in Ice-themed competitive teams.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 25, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 30, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Utility Fodder. While its base stats are among the lowest of all Pokémon, its Hidden Ability allows it to function as a niche Special Tank in lower-tier play before it evolves.
* **Type Matchups:** It is burdened by **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fire and Rock**, and is also **weak to Fighting, Flying, and Steel**. It provides **resistances to Grass, Ice, and Ground**.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its slightly higher Special Attack and utility, Snom utilizes **Bug Buzz** for STAB damage, **Icy Wind** for speed control, **Mirror Coat** to punish special attackers, and **Struggle Bug** to lower the opponent's offensive presence.
* **Abilities:** Shield Dust (Protects the Pokémon from the secondary effects of moves used against it, such as flinching or paralysis); Ice Scales (Hidden Ability: Halves the damage taken from Special moves, effectively doubling its Special Defense in practice).

## Evolution & Biology
Snom is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Frosmoth** only when it has achieved a high level of **Friendship (160 or higher)** and is **leveled up during the Night**. This nocturnal requirement reflects its behavior of disguising itself as an icicle during the daylight hours. Snom belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and is known for a relatively slow hatching process (Hatch Counter: 20). Biologically, it is highly dependent on cold climates, and its silk is sought after for its unique thermal properties.
