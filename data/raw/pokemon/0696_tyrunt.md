## Identity & Lore
Tyrunt (Pokedex #696) is the Royal Heir Pokémon, a prehistoric Rock and Dragon-type species first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). This bipedal, brown-colored dinosaur is a Fossil Pokémon, brought back to life in modern times by regenerating genetic material found within a Jaw Fossil. Known for its selfish and spoiled nature, Tyrunt is prone to violent tantrums; if it encounters something it dislikes, it will run wild and recklessly smash through obstacles. Despite its small stature, its powerful jaws are capable of crunching through heavy objects with ease. While Tyrunt itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Tyrantrum, is celebrated in lore as a king of the ancient world, often compared to other apex predators like Roaring Moon (a Paradox Pokémon) or the ancient Mega Aerodactyl.

## Evolution & Biology
Tyrunt is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Tyrantrum** when it reaches **Level 39**, but this evolution is unique in that it can only occur during the **Daytime**. This biological requirement reflects its ancient nature and its eventual growth into a regal, sun-dwelling predator. Tyrunt belongs to the **Monster and Dragon** Egg Groups, and while it is difficult to hatch (Hatch Counter: 30), it is highly sought after for its rare type combination. As an "Upright" shaped Pokémon, it relies on its powerful hind legs for mobility and its massive skull for both offense and defense.
