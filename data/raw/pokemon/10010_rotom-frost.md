## Identity & Lore
Frost Rotom (Pokedex #10010) is the Plasma Pokémon, a unique entity composed of plasma that has infiltrated and possessed a household refrigerator. Originating in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV), this specific form represents one of Rotom's five appliance-based transformations. Its body is primarily red and orange plasma, but in this Frost Form, it is encased in a cold, blue appliance shell that allows it to manipulate sub-zero temperatures. While Frost Rotom does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its species is world-renowned for its utility, serving as the sentient core for the Rotom Dex and Rotom Phone in later generations like Alola, Galar, and Paldea.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 65, Defense 107, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 107, Speed 86.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Fighting, Rock, and Steel**. It **resists Flying and Ice**, and is highly resistant to Electric-type attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and signature access to Ice-type offense, key moves include **Blizzard** (high-powered STAB), **Thunderbolt** (reliable Electric damage), **Volt Switch** (for momentum and pivoting), and **Will-O-Wisp** (to burn opponents and mitigate its low base HP).
* **Abilities:** **Levitate** (Provides full immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes. This is strategically vital as it negates a common weakness for Electric types).

## Evolution & Biology
Rotom-Frost is a non-evolving Pokémon that relies on **Forme Change** rather than standard metamorphosis. It originates from the base Rotom species and shifts into its Frost Form when it inhabits a refrigerator; in modern games, this is achieved by using the **Rotom Catalog**. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20. Despite its lack of a traditional evolutionary chain, its ability to swap between types (Electric/Ice in this form) and move pools makes it one of the most biologically flexible Pokémon in existence.
