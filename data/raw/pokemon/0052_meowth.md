## Identity & Lore
Meowth (Pokedex #052) is the **Scratch Cat Pokémon**, a distinctively feline creature recognized by the golden Koban coin embedded in its forehead. Indigenous to the **Kanto** region (Generation I), this Normal-type Pokémon is notorious for its love of round, shiny objects and its habit of washing its face to keep its coin spotless. It adapts well to **urban** environments, often wandering city streets at night. While this profile details the standard Kantonian form, Meowth is unique for possessing multiple regional variants: the Dark-type **Alolan Meowth** and the Steel-type **Galarian Meowth**. Additionally, Meowth is capable of undergoing **Gigantamax**, a form where its torso extends to extreme lengths, towering over opponents.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 45, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 40, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Scout / Technician Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a valuable **immunity to Ghost**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Speed and access to the Technician ability, its most effective moves include **Fake Out** (priority flinch boosted by Technician), **U-turn** (for pivoting), **Double-Edge** (high physical damage), and its signature move **Pay Day** (scatter coins for profit and damage).

    *   **Pickup:** Allows the Pokémon to find items after battle or consume a used item from an opponent.
    *   **Technician:** Increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%, making weak moves significantly more threatening.
    *   **Unnerve (Hidden):** Makes the opponent nervous and unable to eat Berries.

## Evolution & Biology
Meowth is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line with complex regional divergences. The standard Kantonian Meowth evolves into **Persian** starting at **Level 28**. Unlike many Pokémon, its evolutionary path is heavily dictated by its region; while the Kantonian form evolves via levels, the Alolan variant requires High Friendship, and the Galarian variant evolves into a completely different species, Perrserker. It belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group and can often be found holding a **Nugget** or **Quick Claw** in the wild.
