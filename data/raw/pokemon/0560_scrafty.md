## Identity & Lore
Scrafty (Pokedex #560) is the Hoodlum Pokémon, a bipedal reptilian species first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Known for its distinct "hoodie" appearance made of its own saggy skin, Scrafty is a territorial fighter that leads groups of Scraggy. It is characterized by its aggressive nature, often beating up anything that enters its territory and possessing the biological ability to spit acidic liquid from its mouth. While Scrafty does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its skin is incredibly durable, functioning like organic armor that it pulls up to protect itself during combat.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 90, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 115, Speed 58.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Setup Sweeper / Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting, Bug, and Flying**, and carries a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Fairy**. Conversely, it **resists Rock, Ghost, and Dark**, and is completely **immune to Psychic** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its superior physical stat and bulk, Scrafty's most effective moves include **Drain Punch** (for recovery and STAB), **Knock Off** (for utility and STAB), **Dragon Dance** (to patch its low Speed and boost Attack), and **High Jump Kick** (for maximum damage output). Other viable options include **Ice Punch** for coverage against Flying types and **Fake Out** for flinching opponents in doubles.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Shed Skin:** Has a 30% chance to cure any non-volatile status condition (burn, paralysis, sleep, etc.) at the end of each turn, increasing its longevity.
    * **Moxie:** Boosts the Pokémon’s Attack stat by one stage every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to "snowball" into a massive offensive threat.
    * **Intimidate (Hidden Ability):** Lowers the Attack stat of all adjacent opponents upon entering battle, effectively boosting Scrafty's already high physical survivability.

## Evolution & Biology
Scrafty is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Scraggy** once it reaches **Level 39**. In the wild, it is often found carrying the **Shed Shell** item, which allows it to switch out of battle regardless of trapping moves. Biologically, it belongs to both the **Ground** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, making it a versatile breeder for passing down moves like Dragon Dance. Its growth rate is medium, and it is frequently sought after by trainers looking for a resilient fighter with a unique typing that counters many Ghost and Psychic-type threats.
