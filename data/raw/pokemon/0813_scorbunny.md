## Identity & Lore
Scorbunny (Pokedex #813) is the Rabbit Pokémon, recognized as the energetic Fire-type starter of Generation VIII (Galar). This white, upright-standing Pokémon is defined by its extreme physical activity; it possesses special pads on its feet and a yellow patch on its nose that radiate heat. According to Galar lore, Scorbunny runs around to increase its body temperature, allowing fire energy to course through its system and elevate its physical capabilities to peak performance. While Scorbunny itself does not possess alternate forms, its final evolutionary stage, Cinderace, is capable of undergoing Gigantamaxing, transforming into a towering figure atop a massive fireball. As a pure Fire-type, it is frequently found in the care of new trainers beginning their journey in the Galar region.
