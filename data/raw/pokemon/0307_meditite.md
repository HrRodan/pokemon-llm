## Identity & Lore
Meditite (Pokédex #307) is the Meditate Pokémon, a bipedal, humanoid Fighting/Psychic-type introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Predominantly blue with white, puffy ear-like appendages, Meditite resides in mountainous regions where it undertakes rigorous mental training to heighten its spiritual energy. Despite its dedication, its flavor text notes that it frequently loses concentration and focus, meaning its training is perpetually incomplete. It attempts to levitate through meditation, a skill that improves as its focus sharpens. While Meditite does not possess alternative forms itself, it evolves into Medicham, which is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Medicham using the Medichamite.

* **Type Matchups:** As a dual Fighting/Psychic-type, it is **weak to Flying, Ghost, and Fairy** attacks. It **resists Fighting and Rock** types.
* **Move Selection:** Despite a seemingly low base Attack stat, Meditite is a powerhouse due to its ability. Its optimal movepool focuses on physical strikes:
    *   **High Jump Kick:** A high-risk, high-reward STAB move offering massive damage.
    *   **Zen Headbutt:** Reliable Psychic-type STAB with a chance to flinch.
    *   **Ice Punch:** Essential coverage to deal with Flying-type threats.
    *   **Bullet Punch:** Provides priority to compensate for average speed and finish off weakened foes.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Pure Power:** The defining tactical asset for Meditite. This ability doubles its Attack stat, transforming it from a weak hitter into a formidable offensive threat capable of breaking defensive walls.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden):** Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it, preventing damage from spread moves like Earthquake in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Meditite is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line within the **Humanshape** Egg Group. It evolves into **Medicham** starting at **Level 37**. Unlike many Pokémon that evolve via stones or trading, Meditite's evolution is purely experience-based, reflecting the lore of its long-term physical and mental training in the mountains.
