## Identity & Lore
Charmeleon (Pokedex #005) is the Flame Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This bipedal, deep red reptile inhabits rough **mountain** terrains, reflecting its rugged and aggressive nature. Unlike its docile pre-evolution, Charmeleon is known for a vicious temperament; when it swings its burning tail, it elevates the surrounding temperature to unbearably high levels to intimidate foes. While it is a distinct entity, its lineage is legendary, possessing the latent potential to evolve into Charizard, a Pokémon capable of achieving two unique **Mega Evolutions** (X and Y) and a **Gigantamax** form in later regions.
