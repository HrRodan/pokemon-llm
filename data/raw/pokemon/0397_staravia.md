## Identity & Lore
Staravia (Pokédex #397) is the Starling Pokémon, a dual-type Normal/Flying avian introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by the black and white markings on its head and its predominantly brown body, Staravia serves as the middle evolution of the region's primary bird chain. It is highly social, instinctively forming massive flocks to compensate for its individual weakness. These flocks are notoriously noisy, squabbling constantly while patrolling forests and fields in search of Bug-type Pokémon to eat. Despite its reliance on numbers for safety, it is aware of its own fragility when separated from the group.
