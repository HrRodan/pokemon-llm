## Identity & Lore
Floragato (Pokedex #907) is the Grass Cat Pokémon, first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This bipedal feline is known for its mischievous and dexterous nature, characterized by the long, thick fur that conceals a versatile vine. Floragato deftly wields this vine—which features a hard, heavy flower bud at the tip—as a yoyo-like weapon to strike opponents with surprising force and precision. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it eventually evolves into the powerful Meowscarada, which gains a secondary Dark typing and becomes a premier competitive threat in the Paldean circuit.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 61, Attack 80, Defense 63, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 63, Speed 83.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Attacker. With its Speed and Attack significantly outclassing its Special stats, Floragato functions best as a mid-game scout or physical pressure unit.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types. 
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical prowess and utility, key moves include **Seed Bomb** (powerful STAB), **Play Rough** (Fairy-type coverage against Dragons), **Thunder Punch** (coverage against Flying types), and **U-turn** (essential for pivoting and maintaining momentum).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Overgrow:** Powers up Grass-type moves by 50% when Floragato's HP is below one-third, providing a crucial power boost in desperate situations.
    * **Protean (Hidden Ability):** Changes Floragato's type to the type of the move it is about to use. This provides both offensive STAB on every move and the tactical ability to change its defensive profile on the fly.

## Evolution & Biology
Floragato is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, serving as the middle stage of the Paldean Grass-type starter. It evolves from **Sprigatito** starting at Level 16. Through continued battle experience, Floragato evolves into its final form, **Meowscarada**, upon reaching Level 36. Biologically, it is highly agile and belongs to both the **Ground** and **Plant** Egg Groups, reflecting its dual nature as both a terrestrial mammal and a flora-based organism. It has a medium-slow growth rate, requiring consistent training to reach its full potential as a master of vine-based combat.
