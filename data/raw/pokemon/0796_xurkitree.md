## Identity & Lore
Xurkitree (Pokedex #796) is the Glowing Pokémon, a bizarre and mysterious life-form classified as an **Ultra Beast**, specifically codenamed **UB-03 Lighting**. First discovered in the **Alola region** during the **Generation VII** era, this black, wire-like entity is composed of materials resembling electrical cables, held together by white zip-tie-like bands. It lacks traditional facial features, instead possessing a star-shaped head that glows brilliantly when discharging high-voltage shocks. According to Alolan witnesses and Aether Foundation research, Xurkitree has been observed raiding power plants to "plug" itself into the ground or electrical outlets, siphoning massive amounts of energy to sustain its power. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence is considered a Tier-1 threat due to its volatile nature and extra-dimensional origin from the **Ultra Plant**.

## Evolution & Biology
Xurkitree is a single-stage Ultra Beast and does not evolve from or into any other species. It is an asexual entity that belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Its biology is strikingly similar to an electrical conduit; it can stand still and mimic a power line to blend into human environments, though its rhythmic, swaying movement often gives it away. Despite its spindly appearance, it weighs 100 kg and stands at an imposing 3.8 meters, allowing it to loom over most opponents while conducting lethal levels of electricity through its limbs.
