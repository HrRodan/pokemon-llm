## Identity & Lore
Mienshao (Pokedex #620) is the Martial Arts Pokémon, a graceful and formidable combatant first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Standing 1.4 meters tall with a sleek, purple-accented coat, it is renowned for the long, whip-like fur on its arms. It wields this fur with such incredible speed and precision that its strikes are often invisible to the naked eye. While it lacks a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, Mienshao remains one of the most respected pure Fighting-types due to its fluid, rhythmic fighting style that resembles a deadly dance. It is typically found in mountainous or rugged terrain where it can hone its mastery of specialized martial techniques.

    * **Inner Focus:** Prevents the Pokémon from flinching and protects against the Intimidate ability, making it a reliable lead. 
    * **Regenerator:** Restores 1/3 of the Pokémon's maximum HP upon switching out, allowing Mienshao to mitigate life orb recoil or entry hazard damage.

## Evolution & Biology
Mienshao is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Mienfoo** starting at **Level 50**, a notably late evolution that reflects the intense training required to master its whip-fur technique. Biologically, it is a highly disciplined predator belonging to the **Ground (Field)** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups. It has a hatch counter of 25, indicating it requires significant effort to breed and raise. Its purple coloration and upright, lithe posture suggest a biological focus on agility and kinetic energy rather than raw endurance, which is reflected in its "glass cannon" stat distribution.
