## Identity & Lore
Cherrim (Pokedex #421) is the pure Grass-type Blossom Pokémon native to the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). It possesses a unique biology dependent on weather conditions, shifting between two distinct appearances: the **Overcast Form** and the **Sunshine Form**. In its default Overcast Form, its purple petals are folded tight to protect its body, appearing docile and reserved. However, when exposed to strong sunlight, it blooms aggressively into its Sunshine Form, revealing a cheerful visage and attempting to "make up for everything it endured as a bud" through active behavior.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 60, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 87, Sp. Def 78, Speed 85.
*   **Archetype:** Sun-Team Support / Weather Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug**. It **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** To maximize its effectiveness in sunlight, its optimal move set includes **Sunny Day** (to trigger its form and ability), **Solar Beam** (which fires instantly in sun), **Weather Ball** (which becomes a high-power Fire-type move in sun to cover weaknesses), and **Giga Drain** for sustainability.
*   **Abilities:** **Flower Gift** (Signature Ability). In harsh sunlight, this ability changes Cherrim's form and grants a 1.5x boost to the Attack and Special Defense stats of itself and its allies, making it a valuable asset in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Cherrim is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Cherubi** starting at **Level 25**. Unlike many Pokémon, its morphology changes dynamically during battle based on weather rather than permanent evolution. It belongs to the **Fairy** and **Plant** Egg Groups. Wild Cherrim may occasionally be found holding a **Miracle Seed**.
