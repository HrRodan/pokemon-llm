## Identity & Lore
Kadabra (Pokedex #064) is the Psi Pokémon, a pure Psychic-type introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its bipedal, humanoid structure and the single silver spoon it always clutches, Kadabra acts as a powerful amplifier for psychokinetic energy. It emits special alpha waves from its body that are known to induce severe headaches in nearby humans and cause machines to malfunction; these waves intensify when the Pokémon faces danger. According to disturbing urban folklore, it is rumored that a boy with psychic powers once woke up transformed into a Kadabra. While it does not have alternative forms itself, its final evolution, Alakazam, is capable of Mega Evolution. It is primarily found in urban environments.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Synchronize:** If the Pokémon is burned, paralyzed, or poisoned, the attacker receives the same status condition.
    *   **Inner Focus:** Protects the Pokémon from flinching.
    *   **Magic Guard (Hidden):** The Pokémon only takes damage from direct attacks, preventing damage from weather, status conditions like Poison, and entry hazards. This makes it an exceptional user of the Life Orb item.

## Evolution & Biology
Kadabra is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line within the Humanshape Egg Group. It evolves from **Abra** starting at **Level 16**. To reach its final stage, **Alakazam**, Kadabra must be **traded** to another trainer. This evolutionary process represents a significant leap in psychic potential, transitioning from a Pokémon that sleeps 18 hours a day (Abra) to one with high mental alertness. Unlike its pre-evolution, Kadabra is often seen holding a **Twisted Spoon**, which serves as a conduit to focus its telekinetic powers.
