## Identity & Lore
Phione (Pokedex #489) is the **Sea Drifter Pokémon**, a unique Water-type entity introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. This blue, spherical Mythical Pokémon is known for its migratory behavior, drifting aimlessly in warm seas while possessing an innate instinct to always return to the exact place of its birth, regardless of the distance traveled. While it bears a striking resemblance to Manaphy, Phione acts as a distinct species within the lore. It is classified as a Mythical Pokémon, though its acquisition method via breeding sets it apart from others in this category.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 80, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 80, Speed 80.
*   **Archetype:** **Bulky Support / Rain Pivot**. With perfectly balanced stats across the board, Phione lacks raw offensive power but functions well as a durable status spreader and pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It possesses key **resistances to Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its balanced bulk and support capabilities, an optimal moveset includes **Scald** (for STAB and burn chance), **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Grass types), **U-turn** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups), and **Rain Dance** (to activate its ability). Alternatively, **Rest** is viable when paired with its ability.
*   **Abilities:** **Hydration**. This ability heals all status conditions (poison, burn, paralysis, sleep, freeze) at the end of the turn if it is raining. This allows Phione to use the move *Rest* to fully heal HP and wake up immediately in the rain.

## Evolution & Biology
Phione occupies a unique space in Pokémon biology involving the **Water 1** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. Unlike standard evolutionary lines, Phione does not evolve into or from other Pokémon in the traditional sense. Instead, it is the result of breeding a **Manaphy** (or another Phione) with a Ditto. Despite being the offspring of the Mythical Manaphy, Phione **does not evolve** into Manaphy. It has a slow growth rate and requires a high hatch count (40 cycles) to be born.
