## Identity & Lore
Farfetch'd (Pokedex #083) is the Wild Duck Pokémon, a distinct avian species introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Recognized by its brown plumage and black V-shaped crest, this Normal/Flying-type is biologically defined by its symbiotic relationship with the sprig of green onion (or leek) it constantly wields. It utilizes this stalk as a versatile weapon, wielding it like a metal sword to cut down prey or nesting materials. Found primarily in grasslands, Farfetch'd is a rare sight and is historically associated with the specialized held item, the **Stick** (or Leek), which drastically boosts its critical hit ratio. While the Kantonian form described here is a standalone entity, a Fighting-type regional variant known as **Galarian Farfetch'd** exists in the Galar region, which is capable of evolution.

## Evolution & Biology
Farfetch'd is technically part of a 2-stage evolutionary line, though this applies specifically to its regional variant. While the standard Kantonian Farfetch'd does not typically evolve, the species is capable of evolving into **Sirfetch'd** when it achieves a specific combat feat: landing **three critical hits** in a single battle. It belongs to the **Flying** and **Ground** Egg Groups.
