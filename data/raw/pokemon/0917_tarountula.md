## Identity & Lore
Tarountula (Pokedex #917) is the String Ball Pokémon, a unique arachnid species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. It is characterized by the thick, elastic ball of white silk that encompasses its body, serving as both a defensive shield and a tactical tool. This silken armor is incredibly durable, known in Paldean ecology for being elastic enough to effortlessly deflect the sharp scythes of Scyther, Tarountula’s natural predator. Though it currently lacks a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, Tarountula is noted for its patient hunting style, often seen hanging from trees or blending into the terrain while waiting for prey.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 41, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 29, Sp. Def 40, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Early-game Physical Utility. While its base stat total is low, it functions as a niche defensive pivot in early-game scenarios or specific low-tier competitive formats.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Fire**. It provides **resistances against Fighting, Grass, and Ground** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its physical Attack over its Special Attack, Tarountula utilizes high-impact Bug-type moves and priority to compensate for its low speed. Key moves include **First Impression** (for massive priority damage on the first turn), **Leech Life** (for simultaneous damage and healing), **Sucker Punch** (to strike faster opponents), and **X-Scissor** (for consistent STAB damage). It also excels at utility, often deploying **Sticky Web** to control the speed of the battlefield.
* **Abilities:** **Insomnia** prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep, making it a hard counter to sleep-inducing moves like Spore or Sleep Powder. Its Hidden Ability, **Stakeout**, is its most dangerous offensive tool, doubling the damage dealt to any opponent that switches in during the turn.

## Evolution & Biology
Tarountula is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Spidops** starting at **Level 15**, transitioning from a defensive ball of thread into a more predatory, tactical hunter. As a member of the **Bug** egg group, it is relatively easy to breed, featuring a hatch counter of 15 (approximately 3,840–4,096 steps). Its growth rate is "slow-then-very-fast," meaning it requires significant experience to level up in its early stages but progresses rapidly once it reaches higher levels. Biology experts note its "armor" shape classification refers to the structural integrity of its silk, which it uses not just for protection but to anchor itself to various surfaces in the Paldean wilds.
