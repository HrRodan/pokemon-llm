## Identity & Lore
Skarmory (Pokedex #227) is the Armor Bird Pokémon, a dual-type Steel/Flying creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Defined by its metallic, gray plumage, Skarmory appears deceptively heavy due to its steel armor; however, its hollow bones and wings allow it to fly at speeds exceeding 180 mph. Native to rough terrain and bramble-filled environments, its feathers are sharp enough to be used as blades, and historically, warriors used shed Skarmory feathers as swords. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is renowned in the Pokémon world for its incredible physical durability and defensive capabilities.

## Evolution & Biology
Skarmory is a standalone species and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group. In the wild, specimens are occasionally found holding a **Metal Coat** or **Sharp Beak**, reflecting the metallic and avian nature of its physiology.
