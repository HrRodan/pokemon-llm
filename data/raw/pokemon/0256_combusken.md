## Identity & Lore
Combusken (Pokedex #256) is the Young Fowl Pokémon, a dual-type Fire/Fighting creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Residing primarily in grasslands, this Pokémon is defined by its intense physical training regimen; it toughens its legs and thighs by constantly running through fields and mountains. Combusken possesses explosive lower-body strength, capable of delivering ten kicks in a single second. While it does not have a unique form itself, it serves as the evolutionary bridge to Blaziken, a Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution. Its plumage is predominantly red and yellow, and it fights with a focus on speed and power, emitting sharp cries to intimidate foes.
