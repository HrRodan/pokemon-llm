## Identity & Lore
Illumise (Pokedex #314) is the Firefly Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This purple, humanoid Bug-type resides in deep forests where it plays a unique ecological role alongside its male counterpart, Volbeat. Illumise emits a sweet aroma that it uses to guide Volbeat, commanding them to draw intricate geometric signs with light in the night sky. While it does not possess any Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is distinct for being a strictly female species, appearing in purple coloration and humanoid shape.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 47, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 73, Sp. Def 85, Speed 85.
*   **Archetype:** Prankster Support / Disrupter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Bug-type, it is **weak to Flying, Rock, and Fire**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, and Grass** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Illumise excels when utilizing its support movepool rather than raw offense. An optimal set includes **Bug Buzz** for Special STAB damage, **Tailwind** to double team speed, **Encore** to lock opponents into unfavorable moves, and **Moonlight** or **Wish** for reliable recovery.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming infatuated or falling for taunts.
    *   **Tinted Lens:** Powers up "not very effective" moves to deal regular damage.
    *   **Prankster (Hidden Ability):** This is Illumise's most viable competitive asset, giving priority (+1) to status moves like Tailwind and Encore, allowing it to act before faster opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Illumise is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it shares a unique biological link with Volbeat; while Illumise is exclusively female, it belongs to the **Bug** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups. Uniquely, when an Illumise produces an Egg, the offspring has a chance to hatch as either a female Illumise or a male Volbeat.
