## Identity & Lore
Giratina-Origin (Pokedex #487) is the Renegade Pokémon, a spectral draconic deity that represents antimatter within the Sinnoh region's creation mythos. First discovered in Generation IV (Sinnoh), this Origin Form is Giratina's true appearance when inhabiting its home dimension, the Distortion World—a realm on the reverse side of the physical world where the laws of physics do not apply. Standing at 6.9 meters and weighing 650 kg, its body is a striking serpentine form with six ghost-like streamers or tentacles and golden protrusions that resemble ribs. Lore states it was banished for its violent nature, relegated to watching the material world from an ancient cemetery or the silent void of its own dimension. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a member of the Creation Trio alongside Dialga and Palkia, and it can shift between this Origin Form and its Altered Form using the Griseous Orb or Griseous Core.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 150, Attack 120, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 120, Sp. Def 100, Speed 90.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Mixed Wallbreaker. With massive HP and balanced 120-base offensive stats, it functions as a formidable offensive presence that is difficult to take down.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Ghost/Dragon type, it is **weak to Ghost, Dark, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It possesses **Resistances to Fire, Water, Electric, Grass, Poison, and Bug**, and enjoys total **Immunity to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its equal Attack and Special Attack stats, Giratina-Origin excels with a versatile movepool. Key selections include **Shadow Force** (its signature physical Ghost move that bypasses Protect), **Draco Meteor** (a devastating Special Dragon nuke), **Shadow Ball** (consistent Special Ghost STAB), and **Earth Power** (critical coverage against Steel and Rock types). For utility, it frequently utilizes **Will-O-Wisp** to cripple physical attackers or **Shadow Sneak** for priority finishing.
* **Abilities:** **Levitate** (This ability grants Giratina-Origin a third immunity, making it completely unaffected by Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, significantly enhancing its defensive profile compared to its Altered Form).

## Evolution & Biology
Giratina-Origin is a legendary entity and does not belong to a traditional evolutionary line. It is a single-stage Pokémon that undergoes a **Forme Change** rather than evolution. It maintains its Origin Forme only while in the Distortion World or when holding a **Griseous Orb** (or Griseous Core in modern iterations); otherwise, it transitions into its leg-bound Altered Forme. Biologically, it is genderless and belongs to the **No Eggs** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its growth rate is classified as Slow, requiring 1,250,000 experience points to reach level 100, reflecting its status as an ancient, high-tier legendary.
