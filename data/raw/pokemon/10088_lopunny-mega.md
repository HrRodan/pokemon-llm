## Identity & Lore
Mega Lopunny (Pokedex #10088) is the formidable Mega Evolved form of the Rabbit Pokémon, a transformation first discovered in the Hoenn region though its base form originates from Generation IV (Sinnoh). While its standard form is known for being extremely cautious and cloaking its body in fluffy ear fur for protection, Mega Evolution sheds this reserve for a combat-ready, aggressive disposition. Its fur becomes more streamlined, and its ears develop a whip-like quality, reflecting its shift toward a purely physical, high-speed combatant. This brown-colored Pokémon is highly sought after for its incredible agility and powerful kicking techniques. Though it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution is considered one of the most potent transformations in competitive history, turning a defensive-leaning creature into a top-tier offensive threat.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 136, Defense 94, Sp. Atk 54, Sp. Def 96, Speed 135.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With a staggering Speed tier of 135 and a massive Attack stat of 136, Mega Lopunny is designed to outspeed the majority of the unboosted metagame and deliver heavy physical damage.
* **Type Matchups:** As a dual Normal/Fighting type, it is **weak to Fighting, Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It possesses **resistances to Rock, Bug, and Dark**, and maintains a natural **immunity to Ghost** (though its ability alters how it interacts with Ghost types).
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Attack and Speed, key moves include **High Jump Kick** (a high-risk, high-reward Fighting STAB), **Return** (a powerful Normal STAB based on friendship), **Power-Up Punch** (to boost its Attack while dealing damage), and **Ice Punch** (essential coverage for Flying and Dragon types).
* **Abilities:** Scrappy (Mega Lopunny’s defining trait; it allows the Pokémon to hit Ghost-type targets with Normal and Fighting-type moves, effectively neutralizing the immunity of Ghost types and making its STAB combination unresisted by any single Pokémon type).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Lopunny is the final stage of a three-step progression. It begins as Buneary, a shy creature that evolves into Lopunny when leveled up with **High Friendship (minimum 160 happiness)**. The transition to Mega Lopunny is a temporary battle-state triggered when Lopunny holds a **Lopunnite** Mega Stone. Biologically, it is highly active and belongs to the **Ground and Humanshape** Egg Groups. With a hatch counter of 20, it requires significant effort to breed for competitive use, but its medium growth rate allows it to reach its full potential at a steady pace. Its physical build is categorized as "upright," emphasizing its powerful legs which are capable of shattering solid rock with rapid-fire kicks.
