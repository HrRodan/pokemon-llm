## Identity & Lore
Empoleon (Pokedex #395) is the Emperor Pokémon, a majestic dual-type Water/Steel creature introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Standing upright with a regal demeanor, it is defined by the trident-like horns extending from its beak; the leader of a pride is traditionally the individual with the largest horns. Empoleon possesses wings that are as hard as steel and sharp enough to cleave through drifting ice floes, allowing it to swim at speeds rivaling a jet boat. It is the final evolutionary form of the Sinnoh Water-type starter, renowned for its pride and inability to tolerate those who hurt its pride.
