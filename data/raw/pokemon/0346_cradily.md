## Identity & Lore
Cradily (Pokedex #346) is the Barnacle Pokémon, a dual-type Rock/Grass creature originally discovered in the **Generation III (Hoenn)** region. Reconstructed from the prehistoric Root Fossil, this ancient predator once roamed the primal ocean floors. Its biology is characterized by a heavy, blob-like base that anchors it in place, while its extendable, tree trunk-like neck allows it to reach out and ensnare unwary prey with its eight powerful tentacles. Though it appears plant-like, Cradily is carnivorous and uses strong digestive acids to melt down its catch. It is predominantly green and is known for its ability to roam the shallow seabeds in search of food.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 86, Attack 81, Defense 97, Sp. Atk 81, Sp. Def 107, Speed 43.
*   **Archetype:** Special Tank / Mixed Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a unique Rock/Grass type, Cradily is **weak to Fighting, Bug, Steel, and Ice**. It **resists Normal and Electric** attacks. Uniquely, its Grass typing neutralizes the Rock type's weakness to Water and Ground, and the Rock type neutralizes the Grass type's weakness to Fire, Poison, and Flying.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Defense and decent Special Attack, an optimal set includes **Giga Drain** for STAB damage and health recovery, **Meteor Beam** for high-damage Rock output that boosts Special Attack, **Earth Power** for coverage against Steel types, and **Stealth Rock** or **Toxic** for utility and stalling.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Suction Cups:** Prevents the Pokémon from being forced out of battle (e.g., by Roar or Whirlwind).
    *   **Storm Drain (Hidden):** Draws in all Water-type moves to itself to boost its Special Attack by one stage. This grants Cradily a tactical immunity to Water moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Cradily is the final form of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Lileep** starting at **Level 40**. In the context of game mechanics, the predecessor Lileep is typically obtained by reviving a Root Fossil at a research institute. Cradily belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group and has a slow-then-very-fast growth rate.
