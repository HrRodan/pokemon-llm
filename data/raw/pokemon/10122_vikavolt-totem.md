## Identity & Lore
Totem Vikavolt (Pokedex #10122) is the specialized Totem variant of the Stag Beetle Pokémon, first appearing in the Alola region during Generation VII. As a Totem Pokémon, this specific individual is significantly larger and heavier than its standard counterparts, standing at 2.6 meters tall and weighing 147.5 kilograms. This blue, armor-plated insectoid zips through the air, concentrating massive amounts of electrical energy within its oversized, serrated mandibles to neutralize threats. In the wild of Alola, specifically at the trial of Sophocles in Blush Mountain or Vast Poni Canyon, it serves as a formidable guardian, often shrouded in an aura that boosts its attributes. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Totem Pokémon makes it a unique regional powerhouse.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 77, Attack 70, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 145, Sp. Def 75, Speed 43.
* **Archetype:** Slow Special Wallbreaker. With an immense Special Attack stat of 145, it is one of the hardest-hitting non-legendary Pokémon, though its low Speed makes it a primary candidate for Trick Room teams.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire and Rock**. Despite its Electric typing, it is **immune to Ground** due to its ability. It **resists Fighting, Steel, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its world-class Special Attack, Vikavolt excels with **Thunderbolt** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Bug Buzz** to bypass Substitutes, **Flash Cannon** for coverage against Rock and Fairy types, and **Volt Switch** to maintain offensive momentum while retreating. For sustainability, **Roost** is a vital utility move to recover health.
* **Abilities:** Levitate (Provides full immunity to Ground-type moves, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes, effectively removing its primary elemental weakness).

## Evolution & Biology
Totem Vikavolt is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Grubbin**, which evolves into the battery-like **Charjabug** starting at Level 20. To reach its final form as Vikavolt, Charjabug must be **leveled up within a Special Magnetic Field** (such as Vast Poni Canyon in Poni Island or Blush Mountain in Ula'ula Island) or, in later iterations, exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. Biologically, it is a highly efficient predator that can sometimes be seen carrying Charjabug with its legs to use them as extra battery packs for sustained electrical output. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15, indicating a moderate breeding cycle.
