## Identity & Lore
Quagsire (Pokedex #195) is the Water Fish Pokémon first discovered in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its upright, blue amphibious body and permanently relaxed expression, this easy-going creature prefers a carefree life at the water's edge. It is famously oblivious, often bumping its head into the hulls of boats while swimming due to its lack of concern for its surroundings. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares an evolutionary lineage with the Paldean Pokémon Clodsire, which is a regional divergent evolution of Wooper.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 85, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 65, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Unaware Wall.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Water/Ground** type, Quagsire possesses a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass**. However, it boasts a complete **Immunity to Electric** attacks and resists **Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel**.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its solid Attack stat and defensive bulk, its moveset is best optimized with **Earthquake** and **Liquidation** for heavy STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage. For utility and disruption, it utilizes **Yawn** to force switches and **Haze** to neutralize opponent stat boosts.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Damp:** Prevents the use of self-destructing moves like Explosion.
    *   **Water Absorb:** Restores HP instead of taking damage when hit by Water-type moves.
    *   **Unaware (Hidden Ability):** Ignores the target's stat changes when attacking or being attacked. This makes Quagsire a premier competitive counter to "setup sweepers."

## Evolution & Biology
Quagsire is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Wooper** starting at **Level 20**. While standard Wooper evolves into Quagsire, the Paldean regional variant of Wooper evolves into Clodsire. Quagsire belongs to the **Water 1** and **Ground** Egg Groups and is found in freshwater habitats.
