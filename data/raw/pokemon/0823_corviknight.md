## Identity & Lore
Corviknight (Pokedex #823) is the Raven Pokémon, a formidable avian species that reigns supreme in the skies of the Generation VIII Galar region. Its massive frame is protected by a metallic plumage with a black luster, a biological armor so intimidating that it is said to drive terror into the hearts of any foe. Beyond its predatory nature, Corviknight is highly intelligent and serves a vital role in Galar's infrastructure as the primary transport for the Galar Taxi service. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, it is one of the few Pokémon capable of **Gigantamaxing**. In its Gigantamax form, its armor becomes even more reinforced, and it can launch "Blade Birds" from its wings to attack foes independently.

## Evolution & Biology
Corviknight is the pinnacle of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Rookidee**, a scrappy and courageous bird. Rookidee evolves into **Corvisquire** upon reaching Level 18. The transition into the armored **Corviknight** occurs when Corvisquire reaches Level 38. Biologically, it is a member of the **Flying** egg group and has a hatch counter of 15. Its transition from a small songbird to a steel-clad raptor represents one of the most drastic physical shifts in the Galar avian ecosystem, as it trades its early-game agility for heavy-duty defensive plating.
