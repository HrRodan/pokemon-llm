## Identity & Lore
Jangmo-o (Pokedex #782) is the Scaly Pokémon, a small, quadrupedal Dragon-type introduced in Generation VII (Alola region). It is characterized by its gray metallic hide and the prominent heart-shaped yellow scale on its forehead, which it uses for both offense and defense. In the wild, Jangmo-o inhabit high, desolate mountains where they live and train together. They express their feelings and communicate with their kin by smacking their scales together, creating metallic rhythmic sounds that echo through the peaks. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Jangmo-o is the first stage of the Alolan Pseudo-Legendary line, eventually growing into the formidable Kommo-o, which is famous for its signature Clangorous Soulblaze Z-Move and its ability to overwhelm opponents with a flurry of scales.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 55, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 45, Speed 45.
*   **Archetype:** Early-stage Physical Setup Sweeper. While its base stats are modest, its Defense is its most notable attribute, allowing it to survive physical hits while preparing to strike back.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides tactical value by **resisting Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Attack stat and access to high-tier physical moves, Jangmo-o thrives with a moveset consisting of **Dragon Dance** (to boost Speed and Attack), **Dragon Claw** (for consistent STAB damage), **Iron Head** (to check its Fairy-type weakness), and **Earthquake** (for wide-range physical coverage).
*   **Abilities:** **Bulletproof** (Protects the Pokémon from some ball and bomb moves like Shadow Ball and Sludge Bomb), **Soundproof** (Grants immunity to sound-based moves such as Roar and Bug Buzz), and its hidden ability **Overcoat** (Protects the Pokémon from weather damage and powder-based moves like Spore).

## Evolution & Biology
Jangmo-o is the initial form of a powerful three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the Dragon/Fighting-type **Hakamo-o** starting at **Level 35**, which subsequently evolves into **Kommo-o** upon reaching **Level 45**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Dragon** Egg Group, and with a hatch counter of 40, it requires significant effort to breed and raise, a trait common among high-potential dragon species. Wild Jangmo-o are occasionally found holding a **Razor Claw**, an item that heightens their critical-hit ratio in battle. Their growth rate is notably slow, reflecting the rigorous training they undergo in the Alolan mountains to harden their scales.
