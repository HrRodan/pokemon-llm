## Identity & Lore
Thundurus-Therian (Pokedex #10020) is the Therian Forme of the legendary Bolt Strike Pokémon, a powerful deity-like entity that first emerged in the Unova region during Generation V. While its Incarnate Forme resembles a genie riding a cloud, its Therian Forme is a more predatory, beast-like creature with a serpentine body and avian features, colored a striking blue with white cloud-like tufts. Known as one of the "Forces of Nature" alongside Tornadus, Landorus, and Enamorus, Thundurus-Therian is a personification of the destructive power of lightning. Lore dictates that this Pokémon flies across the sky firing bolts of lightning from its tail; countless charred remains mar the landscape of any place it passes. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it can transition between its Incarnate and Therian Formes using the **Reveal Glass** artifact.

## Evolution & Biology
Thundurus-Therian is a legendary Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is a single-stage entity that exists as one of two distinct forms of Thundurus. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. In its Therian Forme, its biology shifts to favor raw offensive power over the balanced utility of its Incarnate counterpart. It is often found roaming high in the atmosphere or amidst violent thunderstorms. The transition to this form is triggered by the **Reveal Glass**, which awakens its inner beast and significantly heightens its Special Attack at the slight cost of Speed and physical bulk. It is known for its "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential.
