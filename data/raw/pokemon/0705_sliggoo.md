## Identity & Lore
Sliggoo (Pokedex #705) is the Soft Tissue Pokémon, a unique Dragon-type first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. Appearing as a purple, snail-like creature covered in translucent slime, Sliggoo is notable for its devolved eyes, which have rendered it entirely blind. To navigate its environment and track prey, it utilizes its four sensitive horns as high-tech radar systems. Its biology is centered around a highly corrosive, sticky liquid that it excretes to dissolve opponents before consuming them. While the standard form is a pure Dragon-type, a regional variant known as **Hisuian Sliggoo** exists in the Hisui region (ancient Sinnoh), which possesses a massive metallic shell and a dual Steel/Dragon typing. Sliggoo is the middle stage of the only "pseudo-legendary" line that is famous for its high Special Defense rather than raw physical power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 68, Attack 75, Defense 53, Sp. Atk 83, Sp. Def 113, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Eviolite Wall. Due to its massive base 113 Special Defense and access to the Eviolite held item, Sliggoo functions as a potent mid-tier sponge for special attacks.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Dragon-type, it is **weak to Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**. It provides valuable **resistances to Fire, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Special Attack and deep movepool, Sliggoo excels with **Dragon Pulse** for consistent STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Ice Beam** and **Thunderbolt** (the "BoltBeam" combination) for nearly universal coverage, and **Sludge Wave** to threaten the Fairy-types that otherwise wall its Dragon-type offense.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sap Sipper:** Grants complete immunity to Grass-type moves and raises Attack when hit by one, effectively neutralizing moves like Spore or Giga Drain.
    * **Hydration:** Automatically heals status conditions (like Burn or Paralysis) at the end of each turn if it is raining.
    * **Gooey (Hidden Ability):** A signature defensive ability that lowers the Speed of any opponent that makes direct physical contact with Sliggoo.

## Evolution & Biology
Sliggoo is the second stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Goomy** starting at Level 40. To reach its final form, **Goodra**, Sliggoo must be leveled up to Level 50 or higher specifically while it is raining or foggy in the overworld, reflecting its biological dependency on moisture. Sliggoo belongs to the **Dragon** Egg Group, and despite its slug-like appearance, it is a member of one of the most elite power brackets in the Pokémon world. Its body is composed almost entirely of mucus, and it carries a Shed Shell to escape from trapping effects in competitive play.
