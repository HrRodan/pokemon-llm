## Identity & Lore
Drilbur (Pokedex #529) is the Mole Pokémon, a diminutive but powerful Ground-type first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its sleek gray body and massive, shovel-like claws, Drilbur is a master of subterranean traversal. It can tuck its limbs together to form a spinning drill, allowing it to burrow through the earth at speeds exceeding 30 mph, rivaling the pace of automobiles traveling on the surface. While it lacks the Steel-typing of its evolved form, Excadrill, it is a common sight in deep cave systems and construction sites where its digging prowess is both a marvel and a nuisance. Although Drilbur does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolutionary successor is legendary in competitive circles for its sheer offensive pressure and utility.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 85, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 45, Speed 68.
* **Archetype:** Physical Sweeper / Hazard Lead. In lower-tier competitive brackets like Little Cup, Drilbur serves as a premier offensive threat and utility supporter.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, and Ice**. It is **immune to Electric** and provides valuable **resistances to Poison and Rock** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high base Attack, Drilbur excels with high-impact physical maneuvers and utility. Key moves include **Earthquake** (STAB), **Rock Slide** (coverage), **Swords Dance** (to boost its sweeping potential), and **Rapid Spin** (to clear entry hazards like Stealth Rock while boosting its own Speed).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sand Rush:** Doubles its Speed during a sandstorm, turning it into a terrifying late-game cleaner.
    * **Sand Force:** Increases the power of Ground, Rock, and Steel moves by 30% in a sandstorm.
    * **Mold Breaker (Hidden):** Allows Drilbur to bypass defensive abilities, notably letting its Ground moves hit Pokémon with Levitate (like Bronzor or Rotom).

## Evolution & Biology
Drilbur is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Excadrill** upon reaching **Level 31**, at which point it gains the Steel-typing and significantly enhanced physical bulk. Biologically, Drilbur is highly adapted for a life underground; its claws are made of a durable material that rarely wears down even when drilling through solid rock. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** egg group, and trainers can expect a moderate incubation period (Hatch Counter: 20) when breeding this species for competitive IVs. Its growth rate is medium, making it a reliable partner for trainers throughout their journey in the Unova, Galar, or Paldea regions.
