## Identity & Lore
Partner Pikachu (Pokedex #10158) is a unique variant of the Mouse Pokémon specifically encountered in the Kanto region of Generation I during the events of the *Let's Go* series. This yellow, quadrupedal Pokémon is characterized by its forest habitat and its behavior of gathering in groups to generate massive electrical discharges that can trigger lightning storms. While this specific starter variant is known for its refusal to evolve, the Pikachu species is the global mascot of the franchise and possesses immense biological potential, including a massive **Gigantamax form** where it gains the G-Max move Volt Crash. Additionally, it shares a biological link with **Alolan Raichu**, a regional variant that gains the Psychic type.

## Combat Profile

## Evolution & Biology
Partner Pikachu is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though this specific starter variant is biologically unique and does not undergo transformation. In its standard lifecycle, it evolves from **Pichu** when leveled up with High Friendship (minimum 220). Under normal circumstances, a Pikachu would evolve into **Raichu** (or Alolan Raichu in the Alola region) when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** egg groups, making it a versatile breeder. Despite its small size of 0.4 meters and weight of 6.0 kg, it stores immense energy in its red cheek pouches, which are soft and elastic to the touch but crackle with electricity when the Pokémon is threatened.
