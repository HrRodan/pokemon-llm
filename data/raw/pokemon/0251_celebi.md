## Identity & Lore
Celebi (Pokedex #251) is the Mythical **Time Travel Pokémon** introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Resembling a fairy-like spirit, this green, humanoid Pokémon serves as the guardian of the Ilex Forest. Its lore states that it wanders across time, and wherever it appears, grass and trees flourish, indicating a bright future. Although it shares the "Pixie" stat distribution common to other Mythicals like Mew and Jirachi, Celebi does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms.

* **Move Selection:** With perfectly balanced stats, Celebi excels at boosting its capabilities while maintaining longevity. Key moves include **Psychic** and **Giga Drain** for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage and health restoration, **Nasty Plot** to sharply raise its Special Attack, and **Recover** for reliable sustainability.

## Evolution & Biology
Celebi is a standalone Mythical Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. Due to its status, it belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot be bred. In the wild, it is exceptionally rare and is often depicted as traveling through time to protect the natural world.
