## Identity & Lore
Pineco (Pokedex #204) is the **Bagworm Pokémon**, a deceptive insect native to the forests of the **Johto region** (Generation II). Resembling a pine cone, this gray Pokémon hangs motionless from tree branches, patiently awaiting prey while using its fluid to glue layers of tree bark to its body. It meticulously thickens this outer shell to protect itself, remaining unbothered by the significant weight added by the bark. While it appears sedentary, Pineco is volatile; if disturbed or shaken from its tree, it is known to self-detonate instantly.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** **HP** 50, **Attack** 65, **Defense** 90, **Sp. Atk** 35, **Sp. Def** 35, **Speed** 15.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Hazard Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Bug-type**, it is **weak to Fire, Flying, and Rock**. It **resists Fighting, Ground, and Grass** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Defense and abysmal Speed, Pineco functions best as a utility support. Key moves include **Spikes** or **Stealth Rock** (for entry hazards), **Rapid Spin** (to clear enemy hazards), **Gyro Ball** (which deals high damage due to its low Speed), and **Explosion** (to inflict massive damage before fainting).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing it can set up at least one hazard layer.
    *   **Overcoat (Hidden):** Protects the Pokémon from weather damage (like Sandstorm or Hail) and powder-based moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Pineco is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the Steel/Bug-type **Forretress** when leveled up to **Level 31**. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and requires approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch. Unlike its evolution, which is encased in a steel shell, Pineco relies entirely on natural materials for defense.
