## Identity & Lore
Koraidon (Pokedex #1007) is a dual-type Fighting and Dragon Paradox Pokémon and serves as the legendary mascot for the Pokémon Scarlet version. Known as the "Winged King" in ancient expedition journals from the Paldea region (Generation IX), it is described as a prehistoric ancestor to the modern-day Cyclizar. Its vibrant red coloration, reptilian crests, and powerful build reflect its status as an apex predator of the ancient past. Legends state that Koraidon possessed such immense strength that it could split the land with its bare fists. While its primary combat form is known as the **Apex Build**, it possesses various utility forms for traversing the Paldean wilderness, including its Sprinting, Swimming, and Gliding patterns. As a Paradox Pokémon found deep within Area Zero, it represents the raw, primal energy of the ancient world.

## Evolution & Biology
Koraidon is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. However, it shares a biological link with the modern Pokémon Cyclizar, representing its ancient, Paradox counterpart. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Biologically, Koraidon is characterized by its "Apex Build," featuring inflatable throat sacs and a powerful tail that allow it to dominate both land and air. It is uniquely adapted to thrive in harsh, prehistoric environments, possessing a high base experience yield and a slow growth rate, typical of the most powerful beings in the Paldean ecosystem.
