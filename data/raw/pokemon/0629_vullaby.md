## Identity & Lore
Vullaby (Pokedex #629) is the Diapered Pokémon, first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This small, avian Pokémon is characterized by its brown plumage and the broken skull it wears as a protective "diaper" to guard its soft posterior. As its wings are too small for sustained flight, it spends its time chasing smaller prey on the ground. The bones it wears are not found by the Vullaby itself, but are gathered and provided by its evolutionary relative, Mandibuzz. Vullaby is a female-only species and serves as the dark-type counterpart to the Rufflet line. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a staple of the Unova wilderness, often found in desert-like or rocky habitats such as Route 4 or the Desert Resort.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 55, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 65, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Utility Supporter. Despite being an unevolved Pokémon, its high HP and Defense allow it to be a premier wall in lower competitive tiers, especially when holding an Eviolite.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, Ice, and Fairy**. It **resists Grass, Ghost, and Dark**, and possesses complete **immunity to Ground and Psychic** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Because its offensive stats are low, Vullaby relies on moves that use the opponent's strength or provide team utility. Key moves include **Foul Play** (deals damage based on the target's Attack stat), **Roost** (reliable recovery), **Knock Off** (removes opponent items), and **U-turn** (maintains offensive momentum).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Big Pecks:** Prevents the Pokémon's Defense stat from being lowered by opponents. 
    * **Overcoat:** Grants immunity to damage from weather effects like Sandstorm and Hail, as well as protection from powder-based moves like Sleep Powder or Spore.
    * **Weak Armor (Hidden):** Causes Defense to drop but Speed to increase sharply when hit by a physical attack, allowing for niche "sweeper" transitions.

## Evolution & Biology
Vullaby is part of a two-stage evolutionary line and is a gender-locked species (100% female). It evolves into **Mandibuzz** starting at **Level 54**, which is one of the highest level requirements for a non-pseudo-legendary Pokémon. Biologically, Vullaby is known for its slow growth rate and high hatch counter (20). It belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group. In the wild, it is often seen being tutored by Mandibuzz on how to identify the best bones for protection, transitioning from a ground-bound scavenger to a powerful aerial predator upon evolution.
