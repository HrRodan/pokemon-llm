## Identity & Lore
Small Size Pumpkaboo (Pokedex #10027) is the Pumpkin Pokémon, a unique dual-type Ghost and Grass species first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. This specific variant represents the smallest of its four distinct size forms, characterized by its diminutive 0.3-meter stature and lightweight 3.5kg body. Lore describes the pumpkin-like lower half of its body as a vessel inhabited by a spirit that became trapped in the mortal world; this spirit is said to become restless and increasingly active as the sun sets. While this Small Size variant is the fastest of its kin, it possesses the lowest HP. Pumpkaboo is famously associated with the signature move "Trick-or-Treat," which can add the Ghost type to its targets. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Gourgeist, shares its unique size-based stat mechanics.

## Evolution & Biology
Pumpkaboo is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Gourgeist** only when **traded between trainers**. Unlike many species where evolution is triggered by leveling, Pumpkaboo’s transformation is instantaneous upon arrival in a new trainer's party. Its biology is closely tied to its size; in the wild, different sizes have different encounter rates. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (also known as Amorphous) Egg Group, and breeders can expect a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. Despite its spectral nature, it is capable of learning a wide variety of elemental moves, including Fire-type attacks like Flamethrower and Mystical Fire, which is rare for a Grass-type Pokémon.
