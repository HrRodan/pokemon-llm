## Identity & Lore
Ekans (Pokedex #023) is the Snake Pokémon, first discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. A reptile notable for its purple coloration and yellow bands, Ekans is primarily found in **grassland** habitats where it can camouflage in the foliage. As a stealthy predator, it moves silently to raid the nests of bird Pokémon, swallowing the eggs of species like **Pidgey** and **Spearow** whole. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it is famous for its capability to unhinge its jaw to devour large prey, though this can temporarily immobilize it. Ekans sleeps coiled in a spiral to quickly defend itself from threats in any direction.

## Evolution & Biology
Ekans is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Arbok** starting at **Level 22**. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, allowing it to breed with a wide variety of reptilian Pokémon. Its growth cycle involves frequent molting; an older Ekans sheds its skin regularly to grow larger.
