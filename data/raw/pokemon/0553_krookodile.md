## Identity & Lore
Krookodile (Pokedex #553) is the Intimidation Pokémon, a formidable bipedal crocodilian predator originally discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. Known for its distinct reddish-brown hide and the black, mask-like membranes surrounding its eyes—which protect it from desert sandstorms and function much like sunglasses—Krookodile is a patient and violent hunter. Its biological lore emphasizes its terrifying jaw strength; it is said that their bite is powerful enough to crush the body of an automobile without effort. Preferring arid desert environments, Krookodile often buries itself in the sand to ambush unsuspecting prey, never allowing a target to escape once the hunt begins. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its presence as a top-tier desert predator makes it a staple of regional Unovan ecology and competitive play.

* **Abilities:** **Intimidate** (immediately lowers the Attack of opposing Pokémon upon entry, increasing Krookodile's physical survivability); **Moxie** (boosts its Attack stat every time it knocks out an opponent, allowing it to sweep entire teams); **Anger Point** (maximizes Attack instantly if struck by a critical hit).

## Evolution & Biology
Krookodile is the final form of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Sandile**, a small desert-dweller. Sandile evolves into **Krokorok** starting at **Level 29**. The line reaches its peak when Krokorok evolves into **Krookodile** upon reaching **Level 40**. Biologically, it is classified under the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. It is often found carrying **Black Glasses**, which further boost the power of its Dark-type maneuvers. Its biology is perfectly adapted for the harsh sands, utilizing its dark ocular membranes to spot prey through thick dust clouds, making it one of the most efficient apex predators in the Pokémon world.
