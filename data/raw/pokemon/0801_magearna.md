## Identity & Lore
Magearna (Pokedex #801) is the Artificial Pokémon, a mechanical marvel constructed more than 500 years ago by a scientist of uncommon genius. Introduced in Generation VII (Alola), this Mythical Pokémon possesses a metallic, humanoid body that can fold itself into the shape of a Poké Ball—a state it enters while sleeping or when distressed. At its core lies the "Soul-Heart," an artificial life-form created by gathering the life energy of other Pokémon. While Magearna can understand human speech perfectly, it lacks the vocal apparatus to speak itself, communicating instead through its actions and the subtle whirring of its internal gears. In ancient times, it was presented to a king's daughter, and it is known to exist in a vibrant "Original Color" form that reflects its appearance when it was first gifted centuries ago.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 95, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 130, Sp. Def 115, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Setup Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Steel/Fairy type, it possesses one of the most elite defensive profiles in the game. It is **weak to Ground and Fire**. However, it **resists Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Psychic, Rock, Dark, and Fairy**, and takes double-reduced damage (0.25x) from **Bug**. Furthermore, it is completely **immune to Poison and Dragon** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Special Attack and unique utility, key moves include **Fleur Cannon** (its signature high-damage Fairy move), **Flash Cannon** (reliable Steel STAB), **Volt Switch** (for maintaining momentum), and **Draining Kiss** (for simultaneous damage and recovery). It also makes excellent use of **Shift Gear** to boost its Speed and **Trick Room** to capitalize on its naturally low base speed.
* **Abilities:** Soul-Heart (Boosts Magearna's Special Attack stat by one stage every time another Pokémon on the field faints, allowing it to become an unstoppable snowballing threat in doubles or late-game sweeps).

## Evolution & Biology
Magearna is a standalone Mythical Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is a genderless construct belonging to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Despite its mechanical nature, it is deeply empathetic; it can sense the pain and feelings of other Pokémon and will exert itself to help those who are injured. Biologically, its body is primarily a housing for the Soul-Heart; if its mechanical shell is damaged, the Soul-Heart can theoretically be transferred, though the secret of its creation has been lost to time. It has a base experience yield of 270 and a slow growth rate, reflecting the immense power and complexity of its 16th-century engineering.
