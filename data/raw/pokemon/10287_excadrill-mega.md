## Identity & Lore
Mega Excadrill (Pokedex #10287) is the Subterrene Pokémon, representing a powerful Mega Evolution of the Unovan native, Excadrill. Originating from the Unova region (Generation V), this Pokémon is a subterranean powerhouse characterized by its gray, sturdy frame and its transformation into a living drill. Its biology is centered around high-speed excavation; its claws and head-mounted drill have evolved into a refined steel alloy so dense it can penetrate solid iron plates and bore through the thickest bedrock. Often found assisting in the construction of tunnels and mine shafts, Mega Excadrill is both a tireless worker and a ferocious guardian of its underground territory. While Excadrill is known for its base form's efficiency, this Mega Evolution pushes its physical capacity to the limit, turning it into a specialized engine of destruction.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 165, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 65, Speed 103.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Offensive Pivot.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Water, Fighting, and Ground**. It possesses a significant defensive profile, **resisting Normal, Flying, Psychic, Bug, Steel, Dragon, and Fairy**, with a **double resistance (1/4x damage) to Rock**.

* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its world-class Attack stat, Mega Excadrill excels with high-impact physical moves. Key selections include **Earthquake** for massive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Iron Head** to utilize its steel-clad frame and potentially flinch opponents, **Rock Slide** to provide essential coverage against Flying and Fire types, and **Swords Dance** to boost its already terrifying 165 Base Attack to levels that can OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) most defensive walls.
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega abilities can vary, the species is traditionally associated with **Sand Rush** (doubling Speed in a Sandstorm), **Sand Force** (boosting Ground, Rock, and Steel moves in Sand), and **Mold Breaker** (allowing its moves to ignore the defensive abilities of opponents, such as hitting Levitate users with Earthquake).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Excadrill is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It begins its life as **Drilbur**, a smaller mole-like creature. Drilbur matures into **Excadrill** upon reaching **Level 31** through rigorous tunneling and combat experience. The transition to the Mega form is a temporary state triggered during battle, pushing the Pokémon beyond its natural limits. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field (Ground)** egg group, and trainers should note a hatch counter of 20, indicating a moderate amount of effort required for breeding. Despite its heavy steel-plated exterior weighing 60.0 kg, its humanoid shape allows for surprising agility, making it a versatile threat both above and below the surface.
