## Identity & Lore
World Cap Pikachu (Pokedex #10160) is the Mouse Pokémon, a special variant of the iconic Electric-type species originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). This specific form wears the signature "World Cap" associated with the final stages of a journey through the Pokémon World Coronation Series. Characterized by its yellow fur, long ears with black tips, and lightning-bolt-shaped tail, Pikachu is known to congregate in forest habitats. When multiple Pikachu gather, their collective electrical discharge is powerful enough to generate localized lightning storms. While this specific event form is synonymous with high-level competitive spirit, the Pikachu species as a whole is famous for its **Gigantamax form**, which transforms it into a massive, "chunky" powerhouse with the move G-Max Volt Crash.

* **Abilities:** 
    * **Static:** Has a 30% chance to paralyze attackers that make direct physical contact.
    * **Lightning Rod (Hidden):** Grants total immunity to Electric-type moves and raises the Pokémon's Special Attack when hit by one.

## Evolution & Biology
Pikachu-world-cap is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though most special "Cap" variants are biologically locked and cannot evolve. In the standard lineage, the cycle begins with **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+)**. Under normal circumstances, a Pikachu would evolve into **Raichu** (or Alolan Raichu in specific climates) when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy Egg Groups**. Its biology allows it to store electricity in the red pouches on its cheeks, which it recharges while sleeping. For the World Cap variant, its weight remains a light 6.0kg, allowing it to maintain the high agility reflected in its 90 Base Speed.
