## Identity & Lore
Manaphy (Pokedex #490) is the Mythical Seafaring Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). A small, blue, humanoid creature composed primarily of water, Manaphy is deeply connected to the ocean's ecosystems. Lore describes it being born on cold seafloors, possessing an innate instinct to swim vast distances to return to its birthplace. Often referred to in legend as the "Prince of the Sea," it has the unique power to bond with any Pokémon through its signature move, Heart Swap. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it holds a unique distinction as one of the few Mythical Pokémon capable of producing an egg.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 100, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 100, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Setup Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Steel, Fire, Water, and Ice** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** While its stats are perfectly balanced, Manaphy excels as a special attacker due to its signature setup capability. An optimal set includes **Tail Glow** (drastically raising Sp. Atk by 3 stages), **Surf** or **Scald** (reliable STAB), **Ice Beam** (for coverage against Grass and Dragon types), and **Rest** (for full recovery).
*   **Abilities:** **Hydration** (Cures all status conditions at the end of the turn if it is raining). This ability synergizes perfectly with *Rest* and *Rain Dance* teams, allowing Manaphy to heal fully and wake up immediately.

## Evolution & Biology
Manaphy is part of a unique biological anomaly within the Pokémon world. It does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon in a traditional linear chain. However, it is the only Mythical Pokémon capable of breeding; when Manaphy is bred with a Ditto, the resulting egg hatches into **Phione**. Notably, Phione **does not** evolve into Manaphy, making this a one-way biological relationship. Manaphy belongs to the **Water 1** and **Fairy** Egg Groups.
