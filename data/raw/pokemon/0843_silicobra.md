## Identity & Lore
Silicobra (Pokedex #843) is the Sand Snake Pokémon, a specialized ground-dweller first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Characterized by its unique neck pouch, Silicobra is a master of desert survival that swallows large quantities of sand to store for later use. This pouch can hold over 17 pounds of sediment, which the Pokémon forcefully ejects from its nostrils to blind and disorient predators while it retreats into the safety of the earth. Though its appearance is relatively small, its evolution, Sandaconda, is known to possess a powerful Gigantamax form, where its coiled body resembles a massive, swirling tornado of sand. Silicobra is typically found in arid environments and rocky crevices where it can easily blend into the terrain using its muted green coloration.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 52, Attack 57, Defense 75, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 50, Speed 46.
* **Archetype:** Physical Utility Tank. While its base stats are modest as an unevolved Pokémon, its high physical Defense and access to status-inflicting moves make it a durable disruptor in lower-tier competitive formats.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Grass, and Ice** types. It **resists Poison and Rock**, and possesses a total **Immunity to Electric** attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical Attack and utility pool, key moves include **Earthquake** (high-power STAB), **Glare** (a rare 100% accurate paralysis move), **Drill Run** (reliable Ground-type damage), and **Rock Slide** (essential coverage against Flying types).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sand Spit:** A signature ability that automatically triggers a Sandstorm when Silicobra is hit by an attack, disrupting opponents and buffing allied Rock types. 
    * **Shed Skin:** Provides a 30% chance each turn to heal status conditions like burn or paralysis, increasing its longevity.
    * **Sand Veil (Hidden):** Boosts evasion during a sandstorm, making it harder for opponents to land hits.

## Evolution & Biology
Silicobra is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Sandaconda** starting at **Level 36**. Biologically, Silicobra is highly adapted for excavation, utilizing its tilted head and reinforced nasal passages to move through soil. It belongs to the **Field (Ground) and Dragon** egg groups, suggesting a more ancient, draconic lineage than its simple serpentine appearance might imply. Breeders should note a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles, reflecting its status as a relatively common but hardy inhabitant of the Galar and Paldea regions.
