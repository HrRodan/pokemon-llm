## Identity & Lore
Tangrowth (Pokédex #465) is the Vine Pokémon, a massive, shrub-like entity introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its dense covering of blue vines, this biological mass completely obscures its true form. It is an ambush predator that ensnares prey by extending its arms, which are composed of vines. Tangrowth possesses impressive regenerative capabilities; losing its vine-arms to predators or combat causes it no distress, as they grow back quickly. While it typically remains still to mimic a bush, it will actively hunt when provoked. It does not possess any Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 100, Defense 125, Sp. Atk 110, Sp. Def 50, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Mixed Regenerator Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Grass-type**, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice** attacks. It **resists Ground, Rock, Water, Electric, and Grass**.
*   **Move Selection:** With excellent mixed offensive stats favoring Special Attack slightly, and high physical bulk, key moves include **Giga Drain** for STAB and sustainability, **Power Whip** for high physical damage, **Earthquake** for coverage against Fire and Poison types, and **Knock Off** for utility against item-reliant foes. **Sleep Powder** is also a notable tactical option for disabling threats.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Chlorophyll:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during harsh sunlight.
    *   **Leaf Guard:** Prevents status conditions during harsh sunlight.
    *   **Regenerator (Hidden Ability):** Restores 33.3% of maximum HP when the Pokémon switches out, making Tangrowth a premier defensive pivot.

## Evolution & Biology
Tangrowth is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Tangela** specifically when it is **leveled up while knowing the move Ancient Power**. If Tangela does not know this move, it will not evolve regardless of its level. Tangrowth belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group. Its physical durability allows it to thrive in rough environments, though its exceedingly low Special Defense makes it vulnerable to non-contact elemental attacks like Ice Beam or Flamethrower.
