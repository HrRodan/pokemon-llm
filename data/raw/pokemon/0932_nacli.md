## Identity & Lore
Nacli (#932) is the Rock Salt Pokémon, a unique terrestrial species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This cuboid creature is characterized by its sediment-like appearance and was born deep underground within thick layers of rock salt. Historically, Nacli were highly prized and treasured by ancient civilizations; they were known to be remarkably generous, sharing their salt with humans for preservation and seasoning. While it currently lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Nacli serves as the foundation for one of the most resilient defensive lines in the modern competitive landscape, eventually maturing into the gargantuan, temple-like Garganacl.

## Evolution & Biology
Nacli is the first stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Naclstack** starting at **Level 24**, which eventually reaches its final form, **Garganacl**, starting at **Level 38**. Biologically, Nacli belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, reflecting its crystalline and geological composition. Despite its small stature (0.4m), it is surprisingly heavy at 16.0kg due to its dense salt-rock density. Trainers looking to breed Nacli should note its medium-slow growth rate and a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles.
