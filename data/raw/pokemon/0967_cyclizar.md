## Identity & Lore
Cyclizar (Pokedex #967) is the Mount Pokémon, a unique dual-type Normal/Dragon species that serves as a primary mode of transportation for the people of the Paldea region in Generation IX. This sleek, green, lizard-like Pokémon is characterized by a specialized throat sac and a tail that curls into a wheel-like shape, allowing it to carry riders at speeds exceeding 70 mph. Lore from ancient murals suggests that humans have been riding Cyclizar for over 10,000 years, highlighting a deep-seated symbiotic relationship. While Cyclizar does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it occupies a significant biological niche as the contemporary relative of the Paradox Pokémon Koraidon (the "Winged King") and Miraidon (the "Iron Serpent"), representing the present-day anchor between the ancient past and the distant future.

## Evolution & Biology
Cyclizar is a standalone species and is not known to evolve into or from any other Pokémon. Biologically, it is a member of the **Ground** egg group, and its physiology is optimized for endurance and high-speed locomotion. Its body is warm even in cold weather, a trait that makes it a comfortable mount for travelers. Despite its resemblance to the Legendary Paradox duo of Paldea, Cyclizar is far more common and lacks their overwhelming power, though it shares their signature "cradling" posture. It is a highly cooperative Pokémon, often found in grassy biomes or near human settlements where it assists with daily labor and travel.
