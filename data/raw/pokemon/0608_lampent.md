## Identity & Lore
Lampent (Pokedex #608) is the Lamp Pokémon, a dual-type Ghost and Fire spectral entity first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. This ominous Pokémon is widely feared in urban folklore; it is known to wander through cities, specifically hovering near hospitals, waiting for spirits of the fallen to depart so it may fuel its sinister purple flame with life energy. Its appearance resembles a Victorian-style hanging lamp with a black metallic frame, a clear glass glass-like head, and a flickering eerie fire within. While Lampent itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the vital intermediary stage for Chandelure, one of the most powerful Special Attackers in the Unova region.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 40, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 95, Sp. Def 60, Speed 55.
* **Archetype:** Special Wallbreaker / Eviolite Tank. In competitive play, Lampent often utilizes the Eviolite item to bolster its defenses while leveraging its naturally high Special Attack.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Rock, Water, Ghost, and Dark**. Conversely, it possesses a massive list of resistances, including **Fire, Grass, Ice, Poison, Steel, and a double resistance to Bug (0.25x)**. It is also completely **immune to Normal and Fighting** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Special Attack and tactical utility, key moves include **Shadow Ball** for reliable Ghost-type STAB, **Flamethrower** for consistent Fire damage, **Energy Ball** to surprise-hit Water and Ground-type threats, and **Hex**, which deals massive damage if the opponent is afflicted by status conditions.
* **Abilities:** **Flash Fire** (Provides immunity to Fire moves and powers up its own Fire attacks if hit by one); **Flame Body** (Has a 30% chance to burn attackers who make physical contact); **Infiltrator** (Hidden Ability that allows its attacks to bypass the opponent's Substitute, Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil).

## Evolution & Biology
Lampent is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Litwick** starting at **Level 41**, representing a significant growth in spectral power. To reach its final form, **Chandelure**, Lampent must be exposed to the radiation of a **Dusk Stone**. Biologically, Lampent belongs to the **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** Egg Group. It is a slow-growing Pokémon (Medium-Slow growth rate) that requires 20 hatch cycles to emerge from an egg. Despite its cold, metallic exterior, its biological function is entirely tied to the consumption of spirits, which it uses as fuel to keep its lamp-head lit.
