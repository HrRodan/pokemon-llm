## Identity & Lore
Vivillon (Pokedex #666) is the Scale Pokémon, a lepidopteran species first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. It is famous throughout the Pokémon world for its remarkably diverse wing patterns, with 20 known variations including the Meadow, Icy Snow, Continental, and the rare Poké Ball patterns. These intricate designs are determined by the climate and geographic features of its habitat, making it a primary target for dedicated collectors and researchers. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, Vivillon remains unique for its "Powder" move and its role as a global symbol of biodiversity. Its wings scatter colorful scales when it flies, which can be used to repel enemies or calm the spirits of those nearby.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 52, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 50, Speed 89.
* **Archetype:** Set-up Special Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Electric, and Ice**, with a notable **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**. It **resists Fighting and Bug**, and possesses a total **immunity to Ground-type moves**.
* **Move Selection:** Vivillon relies on its access to one of the best boosting moves in the game to overcome its average base stats. Key moves include **Quiver Dance** (to boost Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, and Speed), **Hurricane** (a high-power STAB move), **Sleep Powder** (to create setup opportunities), and **Bug Buzz** (for consistent special damage).
* **Abilities:** **Compound Eyes** is its most competitive ability, boosting the accuracy of moves like Sleep Powder and Hurricane to reliable levels. **Shield Dust** protects it from the secondary effects of damaging moves (like flinching or burns), while its hidden ability, **Friend Guard**, reduces damage taken by allies in multi-battle formats.

## Evolution & Biology
Vivillon is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins life as **Scatterbug**, which evolves into the cocoon-like **Spewpa** starting at Level 9. The process is completed when Spewpa evolves into **Vivillon** starting at Level 12. Interestingly, while the pattern of the wings is determined by the real-world geographic location where the Scatterbug was generated, the evolutionary requirements remain consistent across all forms. Vivillon belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15, making it a relatively fast species to breed for competitive use or collection. Their biology is deeply tied to the atmosphere, as they utilize their wings to monitor air currents and find their preferred floral feeding grounds.
