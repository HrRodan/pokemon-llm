## Identity & Lore
Vibrava (Pokedex #329) is the Vibration Pokémon, a dual Ground/Dragon-type creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resembling a large dragonfly, this green Pokémon represents the transition from the antlion-inspired Trapinch to the draconic Flygon. While it possesses the visual traits of an insect—specifically its "bug-wings" shape—it belongs strictly to the Dragon typing. Vibrava hunts by vibrating its two wings vigorously to generate powerful ultrasonic waves; these waves are strong enough to induce severe headaches in humans and cause prey to faint completely before consumption. It is typically found in rough terrains or desert environments where it can utilize its wings to kick up sand.

## Evolution & Biology
Vibrava is the middle stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Trapinch** starting at **Level 35** and subsequently evolves into the popular **Flygon** starting at **Level 45**. Biologically, this evolution marks a drastic shift from a ground-bound, biting predator to an airborne hunter. It belongs to the **Bug** and **Dragon** Egg Groups.
