## Identity & Lore
Charizard (Pokedex #006) is the Flame Pokémon, an iconic Fire/Flying dual-type introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Residing primarily in rugged mountain habitats, its internal flame is hot enough to melt boulders, and it is known to unintentionally cause forest fires while searching for powerful opponents. Although not a Dragon-type by default, Charizard possesses significant latent potential, capable of undergoing two distinct Mega Evolutions—Mega Charizard X (Fire/Dragon) and Mega Charizard Y (Fire/Flying)—as well as achieving a Gigantamax form capable of unleashing G-Max Wildfire. It stands as the final evolution of the Kanto Fire starter trio and is often associated with the terrifying power of its breath attacks.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 78, Attack 84, Defense 78, Sp. Atk 109, Sp. Def 85, Speed 100.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Sun Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** Charizard suffers from a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**, making it highly vulnerable to Stealth Rock. It is also weak to Water and Electric types. However, it is **immune to Ground** and resists Fire, Grass, Bug, Steel, Fighting, and Fairy types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack and Speed, key moves include **Flamethrower** or **Fire Blast** (primary STAB), **Air Slash** or **Hurricane** (Flying STAB), **Solar Beam** (coverage against Water/Rock types, specifically under harsh sunlight), and **Roost** (for longevity). **Focus Blast** is often used for coverage against Rock and Steel types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Blaze:** Powers up Fire-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Solar Power (Hidden):** Boosts the Sp. Atk stat in harsh sunlight, but HP decreases every turn.

## Evolution & Biology
Charizard is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins as Charmander and evolves into Charmeleon starting at **level 16**, before finally evolving into Charizard starting at **level 36**. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles. Uniquely, despite its draconic appearance and ability to learn moves like Dragon Claw and Dragon Pulse, it does not gain the Dragon typing until it Mega Evolves into Mega Charizard X.
