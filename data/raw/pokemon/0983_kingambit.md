## Identity & Lore
Kingambit (Pokedex #983) is the Big Blade Pokémon, a formidable and regal commander introduced in Generation IX (Paldea). Standing at 2.0 meters tall and weighing 120 kg, it is a humanoid entity clad in obsidian-black armor that resembles a shogun sitting upon a throne of blades. Lore dictates that only a Bisharp that stands above all others in its vast army, proving its dominance by defeating its peers, can undergo the evolution into Kingambit. Unlike its predecessors who are constantly on the move, Kingambit often remains stationary, moving its massive, blade-like hair to maintain a steady, seated posture while directing its Pawniard and Bisharp underlings with tactical precision. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is regarded as one of the most powerful "Boss" Pokémon within the Paldean ecosystem.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 135, Defense 120, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 85, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Sweeper / Late-Game Cleaner.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire and Ground**, and suffers from a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting**. However, it is exceptionally durable, **resisting Normal, Grass, Ice, Flying, Rock, Ghost, Dark, and Steel**, while possessing total **Immunities to Poison and Psychic**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its elite Attack stat and signature capabilities, key moves include **Kowtow Cleave** (a signature Dark-type move that never misses), **Iron Head** (for reliable STAB flinch potential), **Sucker Punch** (essential priority to overcome its low Speed), and **Swords Dance** (to set up for a total team sweep).
* **Abilities:** **Supreme Overlord** (A unique ability that increases Kingambit’s Attack and Sp. Atk for every ally in the party that has been defeated, making it the ultimate "anchor" for a team); **Defiant** (Boosts Attack sharply if any stat is lowered, punishing Intimidate users); **Pressure** (Forces the opponent to use double PP, useful for outlasting defensive walls).

## Evolution & Biology
Kingambit is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bisharp** when the Bisharp defeats three other Bisharp that are holding a Leader's Crest. Bisharp itself evolves from **Pawniard** starting at Level 52. This Pokémon belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg group and has a hatch counter of 20. Biologically, its body is almost entirely composed of sharp edges and tempered steel, and its "throne" is actually a clever manipulation of its own hair and leg structure. Despite its sluggish movement, its sheer physical bulk and the tactical advantage of its abilities make it a centerpiece of competitive Paldean strategies.
