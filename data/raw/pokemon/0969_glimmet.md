## Identity & Lore
Glimmet (Pokedex #969) is the Ore Pokémon, a unique Rock/Poison-type species first discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. This blue, bud-like creature resembles a flower made of minerals, often found clinging to the walls of caves where it absorbs nutrients directly from the rock face. Its striking petals are not organic, but are actually composed of crystallized poison, which it uses for both defense and nutrition. While Glimmet does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolved form, Glimmora, is famously associated with the Paldean Champion Geeta and is deeply linked to the Tera Crystals found within the depths of Area Zero.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 48, Attack 35, Defense 42, Sp. Atk 105, Sp. Def 60, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Special Glass Cannon / Hazard Lead.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground** and is also weak to **Psychic, Steel, and Water**. It maintains resistances against **Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, Bug, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Special Attack, Glimmet excels with moves such as **Power Gem**, **Sludge Wave**, **Dazzling Gleam**, and the high-utility entry hazard **Stealth Rock**.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Toxic Debris:** This signature ability is highly tactical; when Glimmet is hit by a physical move, it automatically scatters Toxic Spikes on the opposing side of the field.
    * **Corrosion (Hidden):** This rare ability allows Glimmet to inflict the Poison status even on Steel and Poison-type Pokémon, which are usually immune to it.

## Evolution & Biology
Glimmet is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into Glimmora starting at Level 35. Biologically, Glimmet is a member of the Mineral Egg Group, reflecting its crystalline and inorganic composition. Its growth rate is medium-slow, and it requires significant care to hatch, with a hatch counter of 30. Despite its delicate appearance, its poisonous minerals make it a dangerous encounter for unprepared trainers exploring Paldea’s subterranean caverns.
