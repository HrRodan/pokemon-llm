## Identity & Lore
Corphish (Pokedex #341) is known as the Ruffian Pokémon, a Water-type crustacean introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Characterized by its hardy vitality, Corphish is a highly adaptable species capable of thriving in polluted or stagnant waters where other Pokémon cannot survive. Its red, armor-plated body possesses powerful pincers that it uses to latch onto prey, refusing to let go until the target is defeated. Lore indicates that Corphish was originally a foreign species brought from overseas that propagated wildly due to its aggressive nature and lack of natural predators in its new habitat.

*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Trick Room Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.

Key moves include **Crabhammer** (high power/crit rate), **Aqua Jet** (to bypass low speed), **Knock Off** (utility and coverage), and **Dragon Dance** (to boost Attack and Speed simultaneously).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Hyper Cutter:** Prevents the Pokémon's Attack stat from being lowered (e.g., by Intimidate).
    *   **Shell Armor:** Protects the Pokémon from critical hits.
    *   **Adaptability (Hidden):** Increases the Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) from 1.5x to 2x, significantly boosting the power of its Water-type moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Corphish is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Crawdaunt** starting at **Level 30**. In terms of breeding, it belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 3** Egg Groups, with a hatch cycle of approximately 15 steps. Its growth rate classification is "fast-then-very-slow," meaning it gains levels quickly early on but requires significantly more experience at higher levels.
