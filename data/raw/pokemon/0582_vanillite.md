## Identity & Lore
Vanillite (#582) is the Fresh Snow Pokémon, a small elemental creature first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). Appearing as a cast-off of snow and ice that resembles a miniature ice cream cone, Vanillite is born from icicles that are struck by the morning sun. This white-colored Pokémon thrives in sub-zero temperatures, exhaling breath that chills the air to -58°F. It uses this frigid temperature to create snow crystals and generate localized snowfall for camouflage or defense. While Vanillite currently does not have any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants, it is recognized for its high special-defense potential within its evolutionary family.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 36, Attack 50, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 60, Speed 44.
* **Archetype:** Special Attacker / Hail Utility.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ice-type, it is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, and Fire**. It possesses only one resistance, which is **Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its highest offensive stat and utility pool, key moves include **Ice Beam** (reliable STAB damage), **Blizzard** (maximum power under snow conditions), **Flash Cannon** (effective coverage against Rock-types), and **Aurora Veil** (essential utility for halving incoming damage for the whole team).
* **Abilities:** **Ice Body** (slowly recovers HP while it is hailing or snowing); **Snow Cloak** (boosts evasion during snowstorms); and its hidden ability **Weak Armor** (lowers Defense but sharply raises Speed when struck by a physical attack, allowing it to potentially outspeed opponents).

## Evolution & Biology
Vanillite is the foundation of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Vanillish** starting at **Level 35**, which eventually matures into the two-headed **Vanilluxe** at **Level 47**. A member of the **Mineral** egg group, Vanillite is known to sometimes carry **Never-Melt-Ice**, a held item that further amplifies its freezing capabilities. Despite its appearance, it is not a food item but a solid block of ice that remains frozen even in the heat of battle through constant cooling of its internal temperature.
