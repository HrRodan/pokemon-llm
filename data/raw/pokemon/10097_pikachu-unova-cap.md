## Identity & Lore
Unova Cap Pikachu (#10097) is the Mouse Pokémon, a unique Electric-type variant that debuted during the Generation VII (Alola) era as a tribute to Ash Ketchum’s journey through the Unova region (Generation V). This specific form is distinguished by its yellow fur and the iconic red, white, and blue Poké Ball-patterned hat worn by its trainer during his travels in the Unova forests and cities. As a species, Pikachu are known for their social nature, often gathering in large groups to discharge electricity; when many congregate, they can generate massive lightning storms that illuminate the sky. While this specific cap-wearing form is a collectible variant, the base species Pikachu is world-renowned for its potential to undergo Gigantamax transformation, becoming a towering entity capable of using the move G-Max Volt Crash to paralyze all opponents.

## Evolution & Biology
Unova Cap Pikachu is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though special event forms like this one are typically unable to evolve. In the natural world, the line begins with **Pichu**, which evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with **High Friendship (220+)**. A standard Pikachu would then evolve into **Raichu** when exposed to a **Thunder Stone**, or into Alolan Raichu if the stone is used within the Alola region. It belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** egg groups. Biologically, its most vital asset is the electric sacs in its cheeks, which are used to store energy and roast berries to a perfect tenderness before consumption.
