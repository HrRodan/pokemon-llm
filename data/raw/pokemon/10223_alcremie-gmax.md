## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Alcremie (#10223) is the towering, multi-tiered G-Max form of the Cream Pokémon, originally discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. Standing at a staggering 30 meters tall, this form transforms Alcremie into a massive, living cream cake adorned with various sweets and berries. According to Galar legend, the cream secreted from its body hardens when subjected to impacts—the stronger the blow, the harder the cream becomes—giving it incredible physical resilience despite its soft appearance. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, this Gigantamax state represents the pinnacle of its power, allowing it to launch high-calorie cream missiles that can cause confusion or euphoria in opponents. In its base form, Alcremie is famous for having dozens of variations based on the "Sweet" held during evolution and the direction and duration of the trainer’s spin.

*   **Abilities:** **Sweet Veil** prevents Alcremie and its allies from falling asleep, making it a hard counter to Spore or Hypnosis strategies. Its Hidden Ability, **Aroma Veil**, protects Alcremie and its teammates from mental effects such as Taunt, Torment, Encore, and Disable, which is invaluable in competitive doubles formats.

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Alcremie is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Milcery** when the trainer gives Milcery a "Sweet" item (such as a Strawberry Sweet or Love Sweet) and then **spins the character's movement stick** in the overworld. The specific time of day, direction of the spin, and duration determine Alcremie's flavor (e.g., Ruby Cream, Salted Cream). The Gigantamax factor is a rare trait that can be found in specific Max Raid Dens or granted to any Alcremie by consuming **Max Soup** in the Isle of Armor. Biologically, it belongs to the **Fairy** and **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** Egg Groups, and it is a female-only species. While its Gigantamax form is massive and weighs 1000 kg, it retains its sweet, docile nature, often decorating its trainer’s head with cream as a sign of deep trust.
