## Identity & Lore
Zubat (Pokédex #041) is the Bat Pokémon, a ubiquitous creature first identified in Generation I (Kanto). This Poison/Flying-type lacks eyes, relying entirely on echolocation to navigate its environment; it emits ultrasonic waves from its mouth to identify obstacles and targets in the pitch black. Zubat are nocturnal and highly social, forming massive colonies in perpetually dark places such as caves and deep forests to avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight, which burns their skin. While often disregarded by travelers due to their high population density in areas like Mt. Moon, the Zubat line possesses significant potential, eventually evolving into the exceptionally fast Crobat.

## Evolution & Biology
Zubat is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line found in the **Flying** Egg Group. It evolves into **Golbat** starting at **Level 22**. The final stage of this chain, **Crobat**, is achieved only when Golbat levels up with **High Friendship** (Happiness). This evolution represents a biological shift from a chaotic flier to a silent, four-winged aerial predator.
