## Identity & Lore
Poochyena (Pokedex #261) is the Bite Pokémon, a Dark-type canine introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Characterized by its gray fur and prominent fangs, this quadrupedal Pokémon is a common sight in the **grasslands** of the Hoenn region. Poochyena is known for its persistent but cautious predatory nature; it chases prey until the victim becomes exhausted, but it will famously turn tail and flee if the prey strikes back aggressively. While it is the base form of the Mightyena line, it does not possess any known Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms. Its omnivorous and scavenging tendencies make it a tenacious survivalist in the wild.
