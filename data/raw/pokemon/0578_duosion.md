## Identity & Lore
Duosion (#578) is the Mitosis Pokémon, a unique Psychic-type entity first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. This Pokémon is characterized by its green, spherical body encased in a thick, translucent gelatinous substance that protects its internal organs. As its genus suggests, Duosion represents a mid-stage of cellular division; it possesses two distinct, fully functional brains. This biological complexity often leads to internal conflict, as the brains occasionally attempt to execute two different actions simultaneously, though they can double their psychic output when they synchronize. While Duosion does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its final evolution, Reuniclus, is widely recognized for its immense psychic power and sophisticated cellular structure.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 40, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 60, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Trick Room Special Sweeper / Eviolite Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark**. Defensively, it **resists Fighting and Psychic**. 
* **Move Selection:** With a massive base Special Attack of 125, Duosion is a terrifying offensive threat, especially when its low Speed is mitigated by **Trick Room**. Its optimal moveset includes **Psychic** (high-powered STAB), **Shadow Ball** (for coverage against Ghost types), **Energy Ball** (to handle bulky Water/Ground types), and **Recover** for reliable longevity.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Overcoat:** Provides immunity to sandstorm damage and powder-based moves (like Spore), making it a valuable asset in weather-based strategies.
    * **Magic Guard:** Prevents all indirect damage, including life orb recoil, entry hazards, and status conditions like Poison or Burn, making it one of the best defensive abilities in the game.
    * **Regenerator (Hidden):** Restores 33% of its maximum HP upon switching out, allowing Duosion to act as a resilient pivot.

## Evolution & Biology
Duosion is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Solosis** starting at **Level 32**. Duosion itself reaches its final form, the powerful **Reuniclus**, when it is leveled up to **Level 41**. In its biological environment, it is known to consume nutrients through its gelatinous outer layer. It belongs to the **Amorphous (Indeterminate)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, suggesting a moderate development cycle. While it typically carries a **Persim Berry** in the wild to snap out of confusion, its primary defensive mechanism remains its thick, protective membrane and its dual-brained psychic prowess.
