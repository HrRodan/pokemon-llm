## Identity & Lore
Mega Aggron (Pokedex #10053) is the Mega Evolved form of the Iron Armor Pokémon, a massive bipedal creature encased in organic steel plating. Originating from the Hoenn region in Generation III, this Pokémon undergoes a dramatic transformation when exposed to an Aggronite Mega Stone, shedding its secondary Rock typing to become a pure Steel-type juggernaut. It is famously territorial, claiming entire mountains as its domain and mercilessly punishing any who violate its environment. Known for its vigilance, Mega Aggron spends its life patrolling its mountainous habitat, repairing the landscape by hauling topsoil and planting trees to restore areas damaged by landslides or combat. Its gray, heavily armored body is nearly impenetrable, representing the pinnacle of defensive biological engineering.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 140, Defense 230, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 80, Speed 50.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Defensive Wall. With a staggering Defense stat of 230, Mega Aggron possesses one of the highest physical bulk ratings in the entire Pokémon world.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Steel type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, and Fire**. However, it boasts an incredible list of resistances, including **Normal, Flying, Rock, Bug, Steel, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy**, and is completely **immune to Poison**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive weight and high Attack, Mega Aggron excels with **Heavy Slam** (which deals maximum damage due to its 395kg weight), **Iron Head** (for STAB damage and flinch chance), **Earthquake** (for essential coverage against Fire and Electric types), and **Stealth Rock** (to provide entry hazard utility). 
* **Abilities:** Filter (Reduces the damage taken from super-effective moves by 25%). This ability, combined with its pure Steel typing and 230 Defense, makes Mega Aggron notoriously difficult to take down even with its weaknesses.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Aggron is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line, followed by a temporary Mega Evolution. It begins as **Aron**, which evolves into **Lairon** starting at Level 32. Lairon then evolves into **Aggron** starting at Level 42. To achieve the **Mega Aggron** form, Aggron must hold an Aggronite during battle. Biologically, it belongs to the **Monster** egg group and has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its aggressive territorial nature, it is a restorative species that cares deeply for its mountain home, often acting as a guardian of the natural ecosystem.
