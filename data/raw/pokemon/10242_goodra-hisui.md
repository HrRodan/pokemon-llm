## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Goodra (Pokedex #10242) is the regional **Hisuian Form** of the Kalos-native Goodra, categorized as the Dragon Pokémon. While its standard counterpart is a pure Dragon-type, this ancient variant from the Hisui region (the precursor to modern-day Sinnoh) has adapted a massive, metallic snail-like shell, granting it a dual **Steel/Dragon** typing. This shell is formed from the minerals in Hisuian waters reacting with the Pokémon’s slimy secretions. Though the JSON mentions it is "very friendly," Hisuian Goodra is often depicted in lore as being deeply melancholic and prone to intense loneliness, often withdrawing into its shell when distressed. As a pseudo-legendary variant, it possesses a massive base stat total, though it currently lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Goodra is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hisuian Sliggoo** starting at **Level 50**, but only when the weather is **raining or foggy** in the overworld. Hisuian Sliggoo itself evolves from **Goomy** (which does not have a regional form) starting at **Level 40**. Biologically, it is a member of the **Dragon** Egg Group. Its massive weight of 334.1 kg is a result of its heavy metallic shell, which it can use to crush obstacles or protect its soft, slimy body from predators. Despite its heavy armor, it remains a "Dragon Pokémon" at its core, retaining the signature high Special Defense characteristic of the Goomy lineage.
