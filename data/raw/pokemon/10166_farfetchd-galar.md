## Identity & Lore
Galarian Farfetch'd (#10166) is the Galarian Form of the Wild Duck Pokémon, a regional variant first discovered in the Galar region. Unlike its Kantonian counterpart, which is a Normal/Flying type, this variant has adapted to the harsh environment of Galar by becoming a pure Fighting-type. It is characterized by its dark, stoic plumage and the massive, thick leek it carries, which is far larger and heavier than the stalks held by its cousins. This leek is treated as a heavy broadsword or a greatsword rather than a light weapon. According to Galarian lore, only the bravest and strongest Farfetch'd can wield these heavy stalks, and they are known for their fearless disposition in battle. While Galarian Farfetch'd itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the only form of Farfetch'd capable of evolving into the noble knight-like Pokémon, Sirfetch'd.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 52, Attack 95, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 58, Sp. Def 62, Speed 55.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker. With a significant base Attack stat and access to high-crit moves, it functions as a heavy hitter that thrives in the early to mid-game.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** types. 
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high Attack stat and the high critical-hit ratio of its signature weapon, key moves include **Close Combat** for massive STAB damage, **Leaf Blade** for high-crit coverage, **Brave Bird** for powerful aerial retaliation, and **Knock Off** to remove opponent items and hit Psychic types.
* **Abilities:** **Steadfast** increases the Pokémon's Speed stat each time it flinches, turning a momentary setback into a momentum shift. Its Hidden Ability, **Scrappy**, is highly prized in competitive play as it allows Galarian Farfetch'd to hit Ghost-type Pokémon with Normal and Fighting-type moves, effectively negating their traditional immunity.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Farfetch'd is part of a two-stage evolutionary line and represents a unique evolutionary path dictated by combat prowess rather than simple experience. It evolves into **Sirfetch'd** only after achieving the incredible feat of landing **three critical hits in a single battle**. This evolution reflects the Pokémon's mastery over its heavy leek. Biologically, it is a hardy avian capable of surviving in grasslands. It belongs to the **Flying and Ground** (Field) Egg Groups, and breeders should note a hatch counter of 20. Its growth rate is categorized as medium, making it a steady companion for trainers navigating the Galar region's gym challenge.
