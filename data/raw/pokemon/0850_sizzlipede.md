## Identity & Lore
Sizzlipede (#850) is the Radiator Pokémon, a fascinating Fire and Bug-type species first discovered in the Galar region during Generation VIII. It possesses a flat, segmented red body reminiscent of a centipede, utilizing the flammable gas stored within its frame to generate intense thermal energy. Its biology is centered around heat regulation and predation; the yellow circular sections on its underbelly are particularly dangerous, reaching temperatures high enough to cause severe burns upon contact. In the wild, Sizzlipede is known to wrap itself around prey, cooking them with its heated belly before consumption. While Sizzlipede itself does not have multiple forms, its evolved form, Centiskorch, is capable of undergoing **Gigantamaxing**, transforming into a massive, towering centipede with a literal furnace for a body.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 65, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 50, Speed 45.
* **Archetype:** Physical Set-up Attacker. While its base stats are modest as an unevolved Pokémon, its access to high-utility physical moves and stat-boosting options allows it to punch above its weight class.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock**, and is also weak to **Water, Ground, and Flying**. Conversely, it highly resists **Grass (1/4x)** and provides standard resistance against **Bug, Steel, Ice, Fighting, and Fairy** types.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its superior Attack stat and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), Sizzlipede excels with moves that provide both damage and utility:
    * **Fire Lash:** A signature physical Fire move that guaranteed lowers the target's Defense.
    * **Lunge:** A powerful Bug-type physical attack that lowers the target's Attack stat, aiding Sizzlipede's lower physical bulk.
    * **Power Whip:** Essential Grass-type coverage to punish the Water, Ground, and Rock-type Pokémon that threaten its weaknesses.
    * **Leech Life:** Provides necessary sustain by draining health from the opponent while dealing significant STAB damage.
    * **Coil (Utility):** Often used to simultaneously boost Attack, Defense, and Accuracy, turning Sizzlipede into a dangerous physical threat.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Flash Fire:** Grants immunity to Fire-type moves and powers up Sizzlipede's own Fire moves when hit by one.
    * **White Smoke:** Prevents other Pokémon from lowering its stats, ensuring its offensive presence remains consistent.
    * **Flame Body (Hidden):** Has a 30% chance to burn attackers that make contact, effectively halving their physical damage output.

## Evolution & Biology
Sizzlipede is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into the formidable **Centiskorch** when it reaches **Level 28**. Biologically, it is a member of the **Bug** Egg Group. Despite its small size of 0.7 meters, its metabolism is highly efficient, converting gas into heat constantly to maintain its predatory edge. In its habitat, it is often found in warm or grassy areas where it can hide and wait for unsuspecting prey to pass by. Breeding Sizzlipede requires approximately 20 hatch cycles (around 5,120 steps) to produce an egg.
