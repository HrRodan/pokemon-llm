## Identity & Lore
Buizel (Pokedex #418) is the Sea Weasel Pokémon, a distinct aquatic mammal introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its brown fur and the yellow flotation sac encircling its neck like an inflatable collar, this creature is adapted for high-speed swimming. It keeps its face above water to search for prey while using its two tails, which spin like a screw or propeller, to propel itself through rivers and coastal waters with great agility. While primarily aquatic, Buizel is also capable of moving effectively on land.
