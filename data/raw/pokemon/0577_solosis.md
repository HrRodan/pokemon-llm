## Identity & Lore
Solosis (Pokedex #577) is the Cell Pokémon, a unique life form first discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. This small, green, spherical Pokémon is encased in a protective special liquid that allows it to survive in even the harshest environments. Despite its microscopic appearance and diminutive size of 0.3 meters, it possesses immense mental fortitude; Solosis is known to drive away attackers by unleashing raw psychic power and can communicate with its trainers and peers using sophisticated telepathy. While Solosis does not currently have a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its final form, Reuniclus, is widely respected as one of the most durable and tactically diverse Psychic-type threats in competitive history.

## Combat Profile

## Evolution & Biology
Solosis is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the split-brained Duosion starting at **Level 32**, which eventually stabilizes into the powerful, limb-forming Reuniclus at **Level 41**. Biologically, Solosis belongs to the **Indeterminate** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, suggesting a medium-slow growth rate. In the wild, they are occasionally found holding a **Persim Berry**, which helps them manage the mental strain of their own developing psychic abilities.
