## Identity & Lore
Houndoom (Pokédex #229) is the Dark Pokémon, a menacing Fire/Dark-type canine introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its sleek black fur, curved ram-like horns, and skeletal external armor, this quadrupedal predator primarily inhabits rough terrain. Its lore is deeply intimidating; legend states that the flames it shoots from its mouth contain toxins, causing burns that inflict pain which never fades. Its eerie howl was once thought to be the call of the grim reaper. While not explicitly listed in its standard forms, this Pokémon possesses the potential to Mega Evolve into **Mega Houndoom** when holding the Houndoominite, gaining significant power and the Solar Power ability.
