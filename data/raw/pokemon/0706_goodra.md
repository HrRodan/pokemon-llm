## Identity & Lore
Goodra (Pokedex #706) is the Dragon Pokémon, a powerful and affectionate pseudo-legendary first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Standing at 2 meters tall and covered in a signature sticky slime, Goodra is famously described as a very friendly Pokémon that expresses its love by hugging its Trainer, often leaving them drenched in mucus. Despite its gooey exterior and gentle disposition, it possesses immense strength, using its retractable horns to deliver blows equivalent to a professional boxer's punch. While the standard form is a pure Dragon-type, a regional variant known as **Hisuian Goodra** exists in the Hisui region, which gains the Steel type and a hardened shell.

## Evolution & Biology
Goodra is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Sliggoo** starting at Level 50, but only when it is **raining or foggy** in the overworld. Sliggoo itself evolves from the diminutive **Goomy** starting at Level 40. As a member of the **Dragon** egg group, Goodra has a slow growth rate and requires significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its slug-like appearance and dependence on moisture, its biology is remarkably sturdy, weighing 150.5 kg, which allows it to utilize weight-based moves like **Body Press** or **Heavy Slam** effectively.
