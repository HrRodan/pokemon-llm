## Identity & Lore
Sandy Cloak Wormadam (Pokedex #413/10004) is the Bagworm Pokémon, first discovered in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). Unlike its pre-evolution Burmy, which can swap its cloak depending on its last battle location, Wormadam undergoes a permanent metamorphosis where its cloak becomes fused to its body. The Sandy Cloak variant is formed when a female Burmy evolves after battling in caves, mines, or on sandy beaches, resulting in a protective shell made of grit and mud. This Pokémon is strictly female; male Burmy evolve into an entirely different species, Mothim. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is one of three distinct biological variations (alongside Plant and Trash Cloak) that allow the species to occupy different ecological niches.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 79, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 59, Sp. Def 85, Speed 36.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Physical Tank. With a significant base Defense of 105, Sandy Cloak Wormadam functions best as a physical wall or entry hazard setter in lower competitive tiers.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Bug/Ground type, it is **weak to Fire, Flying, Rock, Water, and Ice**. It provides strategic value by being **immune to Electric** attacks and **resisting Poison, Fighting, and Ground** moves. Unlike its Plant Cloak counterpart, it lacks a 4x double weakness, making it more stable defensively.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its higher Physical Attack and defensive utility, effective moves include **Earthquake** (powerful STAB), **Bug Bite** (STAB that consumes opponent berries), **Sucker Punch** (essential priority to mitigate low speed), and **Stealth Rock** (critical entry hazard support).
* **Abilities:** **Anticipation** allows the Pokémon to sense if the opponent possesses a "super effective" or "one-hit KO" move, providing valuable scouting data. Its Hidden Ability, **Overcoat**, is highly valued in competitive play as it protects Wormadam from weather-based damage like Sandstorm and Hail, as well as powder-based moves like Sleep Powder and Spore.

## Evolution & Biology
Wormadam is part of a two-stage evolutionary line with a unique gender-based branching path. It evolves from a **female Burmy** starting at **Level 20**. The specific "Sandy Cloak" form is locked in if the Burmy last fought in a sandy or rocky environment before reaching its evolution level. It belongs to the **Bug** egg group. Biologically, Wormadam is a sedentary species; while the Sandy Cloak provides excellent camouflage against desert predators and cave-dwelling threats, its heavy composition results in a very low Speed stat, forcing the Pokémon to rely on its sturdy physical bulk and counter-attacking capabilities to survive.
