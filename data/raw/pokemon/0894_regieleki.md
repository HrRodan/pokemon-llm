## Identity & Lore
Regieleki (Pokedex #894) is the Electron Pokémon, a legendary entity composed of a concentrated cluster of electrical energy. Introduced in the Galar region (Generation VIII) within the Crown Tundra, this yellow-hued humanoid figure is part of the Legendary Titans alongside Regirock, Regice, Registeel, Regidrago, and their creator, Regigigas. Its body is encircled by unique insulating rings that are rumored to have been placed by ancient peoples to restrain and control its overwhelming power; it is believed that if these rings were removed, Regieleki’s latent electrical potential would be unleashed with catastrophic results. As a being of pure electricity, it can generate enough power to light up all of Galar. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its sheer speed and raw energy make it one of the most formidable forces in the legendary pantheon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 100, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 50, Speed 200.
* **Archetype:** Fast Offensive Pivot / Speed Control. Regieleki possesses the highest base Speed of any non-Mega Pokémon in existence, allowing it to outpace almost the entire competitive meta without a Choice Scarf.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground**. It **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel** types. Its pure Electric typing makes it particularly vulnerable to Ground-type switch-ins, which are immune to its primary offensive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its immense Speed and offensive versatility, key moves include **Thunder Cage** (its signature trapping move), **Volt Switch** (for maintaining offensive momentum), **Thunderbolt** (for consistent high-special damage), and **Rapid Spin** (to clear entry hazards while further boosting its already Tier-0 Speed).
* **Abilities:** Transistor (A signature ability that provides a significant power multiplier to all Electric-type attacks, effectively making its base Special Attack feel much higher than the listed 100).

## Evolution & Biology
Regieleki is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not known to evolve into or from any other species. It is a member of the "No Eggs" group, meaning it cannot be bred. In the wild of the Galar region, it is encountered within the Split-Decision Ruins only after the player has captured the original three titans (Regirock, Regice, and Registeel) and solved the circular floor pattern representing its form. Despite its mechanical appearance, it is highly reactive and capable of performing rapid, zigzagging movements that are nearly impossible for the human eye to track. It shares a thematic duality with Regidrago, representing the elemental force of energy as opposed to dragon energy.
