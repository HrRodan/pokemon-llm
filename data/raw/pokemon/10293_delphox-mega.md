## Identity & Lore
Mega Delphox (Pokedex #10293) is the Fox Pokémon, a formidable Fire and Psychic-type being that represents the peak of mystical evolution within the Kalos region (Generation VI). As a Mega Evolution, it amplifies the latent psychic energies of its base form, utilizing its signature branch as a conduit for devastating pyrokinesis. By gazing intently into the flickering flame at the tip of its branch, Mega Delphox enters a transcendent, focused state that allows it to peer into the future, anticipating enemy movements before they occur. This elegant, upright Pokémon is draped in fur reminiscent of a mage's robe, and while it originated in the Kalos region, its presence is felt across the competitive landscape as a premier special attacker.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Delphox is the final stage of a three-part evolutionary line that begins with the Fire-type starter of the Kalos region. It evolves from **Fennekin** starting at **Level 16**, which then becomes **Braixen**. Braixen further matures into **Delphox** starting at **Level 36**. The transition into its Mega Form is achieved through the use of a Mega Stone during battle. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field (Ground)** egg group. Despite its fiery nature, it is classified under the "red" color category and maintains an "upright" bipedal shape to better facilitate the somatic components of its flame-based sorcery.
