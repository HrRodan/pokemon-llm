## Identity & Lore
Ditto (Pokedex #132) is the unique Normal-type Transform Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). An amorphous, purple blob with a rudimentary face, Ditto possesses the extraordinary ability to reorganize its cellular structure to mimic the appearance, cry, and moves of any opposing Pokémon. While it is naturally found in urban habitats, presumably to observe and mimic other life forms, it relies on memory to transform; if it attempts to mimic something it is not currently looking at, it may get the details wrong. While it lacks its own Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Ditto is capable of copying these enhanced states if it transforms into an opponent already utilizing them. It is famously essential to Pokémon ecology and breeding centers due to its flexible genetic code.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 48, Attack 48, Defense 48, Sp. Atk 48, Sp. Def 48, Speed 48.
*   **Archetype:** Situational Revenge Killer / Copycat Utility.
*   **Type Matchups:** In its base form, it is **weak to Fighting** and **immune to Ghost**. (Note: Upon transformation, Ditto adopts the Type Matchups of its target).
*   **Move Selection:** Uniquely, Ditto relies entirely on a single move: **Transform**. Upon use, it permanently copies the target's stats (except HP), type, Ability, and moveset for the duration of the battle. Because its base stats are low, its combat viability relies entirely on copying a stronger opponent.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Limber:** Protects the Pokémon from paralysis.
    *   **Imposter (Hidden):** The defining competitive ability. As soon as the Pokémon enters battle, it automatically transforms into the opponent without wasting a turn using the move Transform. This allows Ditto to function as an immediate counter-attacker or scout.

## Evolution & Biology
Ditto is a standalone Pokémon with no evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other species. Despite not evolving, it holds a critical role in propagation. It belongs to the unique **Ditto Egg Group**, making it the universal breeding partner. It can breed with any Pokémon capable of reproduction (regardless of gender or species), including genderless Pokémon, acting as a genetic surrogate to produce Eggs of the partner's species. It can utilize species-specific held items such as **Metal Powder** (which boosts Defense) and **Quick Powder** (which boosts Speed) while in its untransformed state.
