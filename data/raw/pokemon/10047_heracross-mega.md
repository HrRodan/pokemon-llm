## Identity & Lore
Mega Heracross (Pokedex #10047) is the Mega Evolved form of the Single Horn Pokémon, a powerful bipedal beetle originally discovered in the forests of the Johto region (Generation II). This transformation occurs when a Heracross reacts to a Heracronite Mega Stone, causing its physical form to bulk up significantly and its singular horn to grow into a massive, pointed lance capable of lifting objects 100 times its own weight. While the base species is typically docile and spends its time in deep forests sipping sweet honey, Mega Evolution floods its body with energy, turning it into a formidable combatant. Its blue, chitinous armor hardens to a diamond-like consistency, and it gains additional vent-like structures on its arms to dissipate the intense heat generated by its increased muscle mass. Though it does not have a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution remains one of the most physically imposing transformations in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 185, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 105, Speed 75.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker. With a gargantuan base Attack of 185, Mega Heracross is designed to shatter defensive cores that other Pokémon cannot dent.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Psychic, and Fairy**, and suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Flying**. It maintains strong **resistances to Bug, Fighting, Grass, Ground, and Dark** types.
* **Move Selection:** To maximize its overwhelming physical power and synergy with its ability, the most effective moves include **Pin Missile** (STAB multi-hit), **Close Combat** (high-power STAB), **Rock Blast** (for Flying-type coverage), and **Swords Dance** (to reach astronomical damage levels).
* **Abilities:** Skill Link (This ability ensures that multi-strike moves, such as Pin Missile, Rock Blast, and Arm Thrust, always hit the maximum number of five times, providing high consistent damage and the ability to break through Focus Sashes or Sturdy abilities).

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Heracross is a temporary evolutionary stage. It undergoes Mega Evolution from Heracross during battle when its trainer possesses a Mega Ring and the Pokémon holds a Heracronite. In its standard form, Heracross does not evolve from or into any other species, representing a standalone powerhouse in the **Bug** egg group. Biologically, it is a "Slow" growth rate Pokémon, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Despite its humanoid shape and heavy armor, it remains deeply tied to its forest habitat, where it uses its horn to pry bark off trees or throw rivals to defend its territory. Its high hatch counter of 25 reflects the complexity and durability of its larval development before emerging as a fully-grown beetle.
