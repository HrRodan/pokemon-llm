## Identity & Lore
Oranguru (Pokedex #765) is the Sage Pokémon, a solitary and profoundly intelligent primate first discovered in the lush jungles of the Alola region (Generation VII). Residing deep within the rainforest canopy, this Normal/Psychic-type is known for its distinctive white fur and the fan-like tool it constructs from leaves and its own purple-tinged fur. It possesses intelligence comparable to humans, often seen using man-made items like Poké Balls or providing medicine to injured Pokémon in the wild. While wise, Oranguru is also known for its pride; it will frequently look down upon inexperienced Trainers, making it a partner better suited for veterans who have earned its respect. While it does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms, its role as a forest mediator often positions it as the natural counterpart to the Alolan Pokémon Passimian.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 60, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 110, Speed 60.
* **Archetype:** Trick Room Support / Special Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug and Dark**. Thanks to its unique dual-typing, it possesses a vital **Immunity to Ghost**, which is otherwise a common weakness for Psychic-types. It maintains a neutral relationship with Fighting-type moves, as its Psychic typing negates the standard Normal-type weakness.
* **Move Selection:** Strategically designed for double battles and utility, its kit is headlined by its signature move **Instruct**, which allows a teammate to repeat their last move immediately. To capitalize on its 90 Special Attack and low Speed, essential moves include **Trick Room**, **Psychic** (or **Psyshock** for physical damage based on Sp. Atk), and **Focus Blast** or **Shadow Ball** for significant coverage against Dark and Steel types.
* **Abilities:** **Inner Focus** (Prevents the Pokémon from flinching, crucial for setting up Trick Room); **Telepathy** (Protects the Pokémon from damage dealt by its allies, ideal for Earthquake or Surf strategies); **Symbiosis** (Hidden Ability: Passes its held item to an ally that has consumed theirs).

## Evolution & Biology
Oranguru is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is a member of the **Ground** egg group, and its biology is characterized by its humanoid shape and slow growth rate. In the wild, it is often seen sitting in high places, calmly observing its surroundings and directing other Pokémon with its fan. Its intelligence is so great that ancient Alolan people believed Oranguru were humans who lived in the forest. Breeding requires a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles, and it is known to be a difficult Pokémon to capture, reflecting its discerning and cautious nature.
