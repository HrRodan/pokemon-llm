## Identity & Lore
Luxio (Pokedex #404) is the Spark Pokémon, an Electric-type quadruped introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Distinctive for its blue and black fur and mane, this Pokémon serves as the intermediate stage of the Shinx line. Luxio possesses potent electrical organs; by extending its claws, it can discharge electricity with enough amperage to cause immediate fainting in its prey or enemies. Unlike many solitary predators, Luxio exhibits social behavior, living in small groups where individuals communicate by touching their tails together to transmit electrical pulses.
