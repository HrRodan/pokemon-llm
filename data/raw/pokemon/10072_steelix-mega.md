## Identity & Lore
Mega Steelix (Pokedex #10072) is the formidable Mega Evolved form of the Iron Snake Pokémon. Originating from the Johto region in Generation II, Steelix is theorized to have evolved from Onix after its body was compressed deep underground, resulting in a composition harder than diamond. Upon Mega Evolving, Steelix undergoes a massive physical transformation, reaching a staggering length of 10.5 meters and a weight of 740 kilograms. Its body becomes adorned with crystalline protrusions and spinning metallic fragments that orbit its neck, reflecting its increased magnetic power. Typically found in deep cave systems, Mega Steelix represents the pinnacle of geological endurance, possessing a body reinforced by iron accumulated from years of swallowing soil.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Steelix is the final stage of a three-part progression. It begins as **Onix**, a Rock/Ground type, which evolves into **Steelix** when **traded while holding a Metal Coat**. To achieve its Mega form, Steelix must undergo **Mega Evolution** during battle while holding its specific Mega Stone, **Steelixite**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Mineral** egg group, and its growth is dictated by a medium rate. Despite its sluggish movement speed, its biological structure allows it to withstand pressures that would liquefy most other Pokémon, making it a true titan of the subterranean world.
