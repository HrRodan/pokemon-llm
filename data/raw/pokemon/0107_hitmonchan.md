## Identity & Lore
Hitmonchan (Pokedex #107) is the renowned **Punching Pokémon**, originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. A pure **Fighting-type** with a humanoid physique, it is defined by the red boxing gloves it never removes and its violet tunic. This Pokémon possesses the spirit of a professional boxer; while appearing to do nothing, it fires punches in lightning-fast volleys that are impossible to see with the naked eye. In lore, Hitmonchan is said to possess the spirit of a boxer who was aiming for the world championship, and it requires a break after three minutes of continuous fighting. Primarily found in **urban** environments, it is exclusively male.

This complex evolution method distinguishes it from its counterparts, Hitmonlee (Attack > Defense) and Hitmontop (Attack = Defense).
