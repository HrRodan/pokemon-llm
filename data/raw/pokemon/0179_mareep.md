## Identity & Lore
Mareep (Pokedex #179) is the **Wool Pokémon** introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Predominantly found in **grassland** habitats, this quadrupedal Pokémon is distinguished by its cream-colored fleece, which stores significant amounts of static electricity. As electricity builds within its body, its fleece doubles in volume, and touching it can result in a nasty shock. While Mareep itself is a pure Electric-type, its final evolutionary form, Ampharos, possesses a powerful **Mega Evolution** that gains the Dragon typing.
