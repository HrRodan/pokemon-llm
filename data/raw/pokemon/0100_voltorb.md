## Identity & Lore
Voltorb (Pokédex #100) is the Electric-type **Ball Pokémon** originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Residing primarily in **urban** environments and power plants, Voltorb is an artificial-looking entity with a spherical red and white body that perfectly mimics a standard Poké Ball. This camouflage often deceives travelers, resulting in electric shocks for those who attempt to pick it up. Voltorb feeds on electricity and is known for its highly volatile temperament; even the slightest stimulation can cause it to self-destruct. While the standard form is purely Electric-type, a regional variant known as **Hisuian Voltorb** exists in the ancient Sinnoh region, possessing an Electric/Grass typing and a wooden composition.

## Evolution & Biology
Voltorb is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Electrode** starting at **Level 30**. Voltorb belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group, though it is a genderless species and can only breed with Ditto. Its physiology is inorganic, and its components are not naturally occurring, leading researchers to believe it was created when a Poké Ball was exposed to a powerful energy pulse.
