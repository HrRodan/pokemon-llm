## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Garbodor (#10207) is the Trash Heap Pokémon, representing the pinnacle of industrial waste and environmental toxicity. While the species originated in the Unova region (Generation V), this titanic Gigantamax form was discovered within the Galar region. In this state, Garbodor’s body has swollen into a literal mountain of refuse; discarded toys, rusted ships, and even airplane parts are integrated into its toxic mass. Its flavor text notes that it clenches opponents with its massive left arm and finishes them off with foul-smelling poison gas belched from its mouth. This form is a temporary transformation achieved through Dynamaxing a Garbodor that possesses the "G-Max Factor," allowing it to use its signature move, G-Max Malodor, which poisons all opposing Pokémon.

    * **Stench:** Attacks may cause the target to flinch, capitalizing on multi-hit opportunities.

## Evolution & Biology
Garbodor-Gmax is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Trubbish**, a Pokémon born from the chemical reaction between industrial waste and discarded shopping bags. Trubbish evolves into **Garbodor** upon reaching **Level 36**. The transition into the Gigantamax form is not a permanent evolution but a regional phenomenon triggered by Dynamax energy in specific Power Spots or by consuming Max Soup in the Isle of Armor. Garbodor belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, reflecting its inorganic, sludge-based composition.
