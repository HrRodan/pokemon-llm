## Identity & Lore
Mega Venusaur (Pokedex #10033) is the Mega Evolved form of the classic Seed Pokémon from the Kanto region (Generation I). This transformation occurs when Venusaur is exposed to a Venusaurite Mega Stone. In this empowered state, the flower on its back grows even larger, supported by a sturdier, more muscular frame and new palm-like foliage. Its appearance reflects its lore as a creature that thrives on solar energy; the bloom is said to take on more vivid colors as it absorbs sunlight, often attracting other Pokémon with its sweet scent. While primarily found in the grasslands of Kanto, Mega Venusaur represents the peak of its evolutionary potential, though it should be noted that Venusaur also possesses a distinct **Gigantamax form** discovered in the Galar region, characterized by a flower so large it covers its entire body.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Venusaur is the final temporary stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Bulbasaur**, which evolves into **Ivysaur** starting at Level 16, and then into **Venusaur** starting at Level 32. The transition to Mega Venusaur is a temporary mid-battle transformation rather than a permanent evolution. It belongs to the **Monster and Plant** egg groups, making it a versatile breeder. Biologically, it is a quadrupedal symbiotic organism; the plant on its back shares a neural connection with the Pokémon, allowing it to manipulate vines and spores with precision. Despite its massive weight of 155.5 kg, it remains mobile enough to seek out optimal sunlight to fuel its devastating **Solar Beam** and **Frenzy Plant** attacks.
