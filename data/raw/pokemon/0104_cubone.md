## Identity & Lore
Cubone (Pokedex #104) is the **Lonely Pokémon**, a Ground-type creature originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This small, brown Pokémon is defined by the skull helmet it wears, which lore states belongs to its deceased mother. Because it never removes this helmet, no one has ever seen Cubone's real face. It is typically found in **mountainous** terrain and is known for its mournful cries that echo inside the skull. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is notable for holding the specific item **Thick Club**, which doubles its Attack stat. Cubone possesses a unique evolutionary divergence based on the region; in the Alola region, it evolves into a Fire/Ghost regional variant.
