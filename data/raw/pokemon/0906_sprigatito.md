## Identity & Lore
Sprigatito (Pokedex #906) is the Grass Cat Pokémon, serving as the iconic Grass-type starter for trainers beginning their journey in the Paldea region of Generation IX. This quadrupedal, green feline is characterized by its fluffy fur, which possesses a chemical composition remarkably similar to plant life, allowing it to absorb energy through photosynthesis. Sprigatito is known for its fastidious nature, frequently washing its face to prevent its fur-leaves from drying out and to maintain its ability to release a sweet, therapeutic aroma that can lull foes into losing their will to battle. While Sprigatito does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Meowscarada, is renowned for its signature "Flower Trick" move and its secondary Dark typing. As a Paldean native, Sprigatito is also capable of utilizing the Terastal phenomenon to crystalline its form and enhance its elemental power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 61, Defense 54, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 45, Speed 65.
* **Archetype:** Physical Speed Lead. In its unevolved state, Sprigatito relies on its superior Speed and respectable Attack stat to outpace other basic-stage Pokémon.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It effectively **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its physical Attack stat and utility, Sprigatito excels with moves such as **Seed Bomb** for primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Play Rough** for Fairy-type coverage against Dragons, **U-turn** for tactical pivoting and scouting, and **Sucker Punch** to provide crucial priority against faster, weakened opponents.
* **Abilities:** **Overgrow** (Standard) increases the power of Grass-type moves by 50% when Sprigatito's HP falls below one-third. **Protean** (Hidden) is its most competitive ability, allowing it to change its type to match the move it is about to use, granting it offensive flexibility and shifting its defensive profile mid-turn.

## Evolution & Biology
Sprigatito is the first stage of a three-part evolutionary line. It evolves into **Floragato** upon reaching **Level 16**, at which point it begins to transition into a bipedal stance. The line reaches its peak when Floragato evolves into **Meowscarada** at **Level 36**, gaining the Dark type. Biologically, Sprigatito is a versatile breeder belonging to both the **Ground and Plant Egg Groups**, making it compatible with a wide variety of feline and botanical Pokémon. It has a hatch counter of 20 (approximately 5,120 steps) and follows a medium-slow growth rate, requiring consistent training to reach its full potential as a master magician of the battlefield.
