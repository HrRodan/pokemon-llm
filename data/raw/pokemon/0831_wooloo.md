## Identity & Lore
Wooloo (Pokedex #831) is the Sheep Pokémon, a fluffy quadruped species first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Its most defining characteristic is its incredibly dense, curly white fleece which serves as a biological cushion; the wool is so effective at absorbing shock that a Wooloo can tumble off a high cliff and stand up at the bottom without a single scratch. This Pokémon is deeply integrated into Galarian culture, particularly in farming communities like Postwick, where its wool is prized for high-quality textiles. While Wooloo does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it is famously known as the signature companion of the Galar region rival, Hop. Behaviorally, Wooloo are timid and tend to avoid conflict by rolling away like a ball when they sense a threat, often using their fleece to bounce over obstacles.

## Evolution & Biology
Wooloo is part of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Dubwool** starting at **Level 24**, gaining significantly more mass and impressive horns used for territorial disputes. Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group, with a hatch counter of 15 (approximately 3,840–4,096 steps). Its growth rate is classified as Medium, and it is known for its extreme friendliness, though it is easily spooked by predatory Pokémon like Corviknight. In the wild, they are often seen moving in herds, following a leader or a shepherd to grazing lands across the Galar Route 1 and the Wild Area.
