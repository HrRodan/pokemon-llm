## Identity & Lore
Ludicolo (Pokedex #272) is the Carefree Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Grass creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Visually resembling a bipedal duck or kappa with a pineapple-like body and a large lily pad acting as a sombrero, this Pokémon is usually found near the water's edge. According to biological research, Ludicolo's muscle cells become incredibly energetic when it hears cheerful, festive music, compelling it to dance uncontrollably. It creates a rhythm by snapping its fingers and is known to appear when it hears children singing on hiking outings. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Ludicolo is famous in lore for its upbeat personality and is often associated with the eccentric trainer Miror B. in the Orre region.
