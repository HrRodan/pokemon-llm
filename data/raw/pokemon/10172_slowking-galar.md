## Identity & Lore
Galarian Slowking (Pokedex #10172) is the Royal Pokémon, a unique regional variant originating from the Galar region (Generation VIII). While its Johto counterpart is a Water/Psychic type, the Galarian form underwent a radical transformation due to the chemical reaction between its internal toxins and the Galarica spices it consumed. This process resulted in the Shellder on its head gaining such immense intelligence that it now controls the host, rather than the other way around. Known for its incredible intellect and intuition, Galarian Slowking remains calm and collected in all situations, often chanting mysterious spells that sound like a strange language. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its signature move and unique biological makeup make it a standout compared to the Kantonian Slowbro and Slowking.

## Evolution & Biology
Galarian Slowking is the final stage of a branched evolutionary line. It evolves from **Galarian Slowpoke** when exposed to a **Galarica Wreath**, an item woven from Galarica twigs found on the Frigid Sea. This is distinct from the Johto variant, which requires a King's Rock and trading. Biology-wise, the Shellder's toxins have completely overtaken Slowking's nervous system, granting it psychic powers that rival the most powerful thinkers in the Pokémon world. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20, requiring significant effort to breed for optimal competitive IVs.
