## Identity & Lore
Lucario (Pokedex #448) is the dual-type Fighting/Steel **Aura Pokémon** introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Distinguished by its blue and black fur and the appendages on the back of its head used to sense surroundings, Lucario is capable of detecting and manipulating **Aura**, the invisible life energy of living creatures. This heightened perception allows it to track invisible foes and predict movements, and its high intelligence enables it to understand human speech. While typically calm and collected, it is a formidable warrior. Through the use of Lucarionite, it is capable of **Mega Evolution** into Mega Lucario, a form where its ruthless fighting style and overflowing Aura energy can leave deep black markings on its body.

## Evolution & Biology
Lucario is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Riolu** when leveled up with **High Friendship (Happiness)** during the **Daytime**. It falls into the **Ground** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups. Unlike many Fighting-types, Lucario relies on spiritual energy as much as physical prowess, and its steel typing is derived from its metallic skeletal structure and spikes.
