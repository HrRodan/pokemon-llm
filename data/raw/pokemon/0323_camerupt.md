## Identity & Lore
Camerupt (Pokedex #323) is the Fire/Ground-type **Eruption Pokémon** introduced in Generation III (**Hoenn**). Residing primarily in mountainous regions and volcanic craters, this red, quadrupedal Pokémon is distinguished by the two volcano-like humps on its back. Lore indicates that a volcano physically exists inside its body, circulating magma that reaches temperatures of **18,000 degrees Fahrenheit**. When Camerupt is enraged, these humps erupt, spewing superheated magma. While generally lethargic, it possesses the capability to utilize the Cameruptite to undergo **Mega Evolution** into **Mega Camerupt**, merging its humps into a single active volcano and significantly boosting its offensive power.

## Evolution & Biology
Camerupt is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Numel** upon reaching **Level 33**. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and can occasionally be found holding a **Rawst Berry** in the wild. Its biological cycle is deeply tied to seismic activity, as its body temperature rises with its anger or when it is about to erupt.
