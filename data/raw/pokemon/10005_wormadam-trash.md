## Identity & Lore
Trash Cloak Wormadam (Pokedex #10005) is the Bagworm Pokémon, a unique evolutionary variant originating in the Sinnoh region (Generation IV). Unlike its counterparts that utilize leaves or sand, this specific form is fused with refuse and building materials, a result of a female Burmy evolving after a battle within a building or urban environment. The pink, insulation-like cloak is not merely a covering but has become a permanent, inseparable part of its biological structure. While it lacks Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox iterations, its existence is a testament to the adaptive biology of the Burmy line, which branches into either the moth-like Mothim (if male) or one of three Wormadam cloaks (if female).

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 69, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 69, Sp. Def 95, Speed 36.
* **Archetype:** Defensive Utility Tank. Its primary value lies in its exceptional defensive typing and access to support moves rather than raw offensive pressure.
* **Type Matchups:** It possesses the elite Bug/Steel typing, making it **weak only to Fire**, though it suffers a **Double Weakness (4x)** to it. It boasts a staggering array of resistances, including Normal, Bug, Steel, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy, with a 4x resistance to Grass and a total immunity to Poison.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its balanced offensive stats and utility pool, key moves include **Flash Cannon** for STAB-boosted Steel damage, **Bug Buzz** for Special Bug-type coverage, **Quiver Dance** to patch up its low Speed while boosting its Special bulk, and **Stealth Rock** to provide essential entry hazard support.
* **Abilities:** **Anticipation** allows it to sense dangerous super-effective moves (like Fire-type attacks) or one-hit KO moves upon entering battle. Its Hidden Ability, **Overcoat**, grants it immunity to weather-based damage (like Sandstorm) and powder-based moves (like Spore or Sleep Powder), making it a reliable pivot against status-heavy teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Wormadam is part of a two-stage evolutionary line with a complex branching path. It evolves from a **female Burmy** starting at Level 20. The "Trash Cloak" form is permanently locked in if the evolution occurs after the Burmy has most recently fought in a city, building, or gymnasium. If the Burmy were male, it would instead evolve into Mothim regardless of the environment. As a member of the **Bug Egg Group**, it is known to occasionally carry the **Silver Powder** item in the wild, which enhances the power of Bug-type maneuvers. Its biology is defined by its sedentary nature and its reliance on its reinforced cloak for protection against urban predators.
