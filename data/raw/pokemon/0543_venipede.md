## Identity & Lore
Venipede (Pokedex #543) is the Centipede Pokémon, a dual-type Bug and Poison creature first discovered in the Unova region during Generation V. Characterized by its vibrant red, segmented armor and aggressive temperament, Venipede is a ground-dwelling invertebrate often found in forests and tall grass. According to ecological records, it is remarkably territorial; it uses the sensory feelers on its head and tail to detect vibrations in the air. Its biology is centered around predation defense; its bite injects a potent toxin capable of paralyzing even large bird Pokémon, such as Tranquill or Unfezant, that attempt to prey upon it. While Venipede does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its final evolution, Scolipede, is renowned in the competitive circuit for its devastating speed and physical power.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 30, Attack 45, Defense 59, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 39, Speed 57.
* **Archetype:** Physical Entry Hazard Lead. Despite its status as a base-stage Pokémon, Venipede’s access to rare utility moves and its Hidden Ability make it a viable niche lead in lower-tier competitive brackets.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Flying, Psychic, and Rock** types. Conversely, it highly **resists Fighting and Grass (0.25x damage)**, and provides standard resistance against Poison, Bug, and Fairy types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its higher Physical Attack and utility potential, Venipede excels with **Poison Jab** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Bug Bite** to consume opponent berries, and the hazard-setting duo of **Toxic Spikes** and **Spikes** to pressure the opposing team.
* **Abilities:** Venipede possesses **Poison Point**, which has a 30% chance to poison attackers upon contact, and **Swarm**, which boosts Bug-type moves when health is low. Its most prestigious trait is its Hidden Ability, **Speed Boost**, which increases its Speed stat at the end of every turn, allowing it to outpace most threats if it remains on the field.

## Evolution & Biology
Venipede is the initial stage of a powerful three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the cocoon-like **Whirlipede** starting at Level 22, and eventually reaches its final form, the massive **Scolipede**, at Level 30. Biologically, Venipede is part of the **Bug** egg group and has a medium-slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential. Trainers encountering Venipede in the wild may find it holding a **Pecha Berry** to neutralize its own type-effectiveness or a **Poison Barb** to enhance its toxic strikes. Its physical build is categorized as "armor-shaped," reflecting the hard exoskeleton that provides its respectable base Defense.
