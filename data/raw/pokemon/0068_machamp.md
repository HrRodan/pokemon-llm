## Identity & Lore
Machamp (Pokedex #068) is the Superpower Pokémon, a massive fighting specimen introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its gray skin and four muscular arms, this humanoid titan is capable of executing moves at blinding speeds; lore states it can unleash 1,000 punches in just two seconds. Its physiology is optimized for power over dexterity, as it struggles with delicate tasks but excels in combat within its native mountain habitats. While normally grounded, Machamp gained significant attention in the Galar region with a **Gigantamax form**, where its fists glow with immeasurable energy to unleash the G-Max move *G-Max Chi Strike*.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 130, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 85, Speed 55.

*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy** attacks. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 130 Attack stat and ability synergy, key moves include **Dynamic Punch** (guaranteed confusion), **Stone Edge** (coverage against Flying-types), **Knock Off** (utility against Psychics/Ghosts), and **Bullet Punch** (priority to compensate for low speed).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **No Guard:** Ensures that both Machamp's and the opponent's moves never miss. This is tactically vital for landing low-accuracy, high-power moves like *Dynamic Punch* or *Stone Edge*.
    *   **Guts:** Boosts Attack by 50% if the Pokémon has a status condition (Burn, Paralyze, Poison).
    *   **Steadfast (Hidden):** Boosts Speed by one stage each time the Pokémon flinches.

## Evolution & Biology
