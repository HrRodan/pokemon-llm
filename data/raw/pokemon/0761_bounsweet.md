## Identity & Lore
Bounsweet (Pokedex #761) is the Fruit Pokémon, a diminutive Grass-type species first discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. This purple, berry-like Pokémon is renowned for the "delectable aroma" that wafts from its body, a scent so sweet it has a calming effect on humans, leading many to use it as a living air freshener. However, this fragrance is a double-edged sword in the wild; it frequently lures predators like Toucannon, which often swallow Bounsweet whole. To defend itself, it rotates the calyx on its head to drive away foes, though its frantic spinning often leaves it dizzy. While Bounsweet does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, its final evolution, Tsareena, is known for its formidable "Queenly Majesty" and high-tier competitive presence.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 42, Attack 30, Defense 38, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 38, Speed 32.
* **Archetype:** Pre-Evolution Utility Support. Due to its low base stat total, Bounsweet functions primarily as a support core in Little Cup (LC) formats, focusing on hazard removal and status spreading.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric** types.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its balanced (though low) offensive stats and utility pool, key moves include **Giga Drain** (for STAB recovery), **Energy Ball** (high-consistency special damage), **Play Rough** (physical Fairy-type coverage), and **Rapid Spin** (crucial for clearing entry hazards like Stealth Rock).
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Leaf Guard:** Prevents status conditions during harsh sunlight. 
    * **Oblivious:** Grants immunity to being infatuated, intimidated, or Taunted, ensuring it can execute support moves. 
    * **Sweet Veil (Hidden):** Prevents Bounsweet and its allies from falling asleep, a vital tactical asset against Sleep Powder or Spore users.
* **Held Items:** It is occasionally found in the wild carrying a **Grassy Seed**, which boosts Defense when Grassy Terrain is active.

## Evolution & Biology
Bounsweet is the initial stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Steenee** starting at Level 18. The transition to its final form, **Tsareena**, is unique: Steenee must **level up while knowing the move "Stomp"** (typically learned at Level 28 or via Move Reminder). Biologically, Bounsweet belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20, making it a relatively common sight for breeders. Its growth rate is "medium-slow," requiring patient training to reach its full potential as a regal combatant. Moving with its small legs, it prefers lush, tropical environments where it can photosynthesize and replenish its aromatic oils.
