## Identity & Lore
Mega Banette (Pokedex #10056) is the Marionette Pokémon, representing a tragic and vengeful evolution of a discarded plush doll. Originally introduced in Generation III (Hoenn), this Ghost-type reaches its peak form through Mega Evolution, a transformation that causes the zippers across its body to open, releasing a terrifying amount of cursed energy that was previously suppressed. Its dark lore suggests that it was a lonely toy brought to life by a powerful grudge against the child who threw it away. It inhabits urban environments, lurking in alleys and dark corners, searching for its original owner while sticking pins into its own body to generate energy for laying powerful curses. While it does not have a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution is a staple of its identity, enhancing its eerie, puppet-like appearance with elongated, spindly limbs and numerous additional zippers.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Banette is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line, triggered temporarily in battle when a Banette holds a Banettite Mega Stone. It begins its life as **Shuppet**, which is drawn to feelings of envy and malice. Shuppet evolves into **Banette** starting at **Level 37**. Biologically, Mega Banette is characterized by its zippers, which act as a seal for its spectral essence; should they ever be fully undone, its cursed energy would dissipate. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group and is known for a **Fast** growth rate, allowing it to reach combat maturity quickly. Trainers often find it with a **Spell Tag** held item in the wild, which further boosts its ghostly powers.
