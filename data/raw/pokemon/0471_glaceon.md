## Identity & Lore
Glaceon (Pokedex #471) is the **Fresh Snow Pokémon**, introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. A specialized evolution of Eevee, this pure Ice-type is adapted to sub-zero environments. It possesses the ability to control its body heat, freezing the surrounding air to create diamond dust or lower the temperature to -75 degrees Fahrenheit. As a protective technique, Glaceon can freeze its blue fur instantly, transforming the hairs into sharp, needle-like spines to deter predators. While it appears elegant and composed, it attacks unsuspecting prey by creating flurries of powdered snow.

## Evolution & Biology
Glaceon is a stage-1 Pokémon in the branched evolutionary line of **Eevee**. It evolves from Eevee when leveled up near an **Ice Rock** (found in locations such as Sinnoh's Route 217, Unova's Twist Mountain, or Kalos's Frost Cavern) or when exposed to an **Ice Stone**. It is one of eight possible "Eeveelutions." Glaceon belongs to the **Field** (listed as "ground" in data) Egg Group.
