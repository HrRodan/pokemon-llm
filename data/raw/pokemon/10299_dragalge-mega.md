## Identity & Lore
Mega Dragalge (Pokedex #10299) is the Mega Evolved form of the Mock Kelp Pokémon, a specialized Poison/Dragon-type predator first discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Resembling a tattered piece of aquatic vegetation, this Pokémon uses sophisticated mimicry to drift through the ocean unnoticed until it is within striking distance of prey. Its biology is defined by an incredibly potent toxicity; its venom is concentrated enough to corrode the metal hulls of massive tankers, and it is known to spray this acidic poison indiscriminately at any creature that inadvertently wanders into its kelp-forest territory. While the standard Dragalge is a formidable deep-sea dweller, this Mega Evolution pushes its draconic traits and special offensive capabilities to their absolute peak, transforming it into a living chemical weapon.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 85, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 132, Sp. Def 163, Speed 44.
* **Archetype:** Special Tank / Bulky Wallbreaker. Its immense Special Defense and respectable Physical Defense allow it to trade hits effectively despite its abysmal Speed.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground, Psychic, Ice, and Dragon**. Due to its Poison/Dragon typing, it possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Grass** and resists Fire, Water, Electric, Poison, and Bug. Notably, its Poison typing neutralizes the traditional Dragon weakness to Fairy-type moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive Base 132 Special Attack, it excels with moves such as **Draco Meteor** (massive STAB damage), **Sludge Wave** (primary Poison STAB with a high chance to poison), **Focus Blast** (essential coverage against Steel-types), and **Hydro Pump** (referencing its aquatic origins to hit Ground-types).
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-ability data is restricted, it typically utilizes **Adaptability**, which significantly boosts the power of its Poison and Dragon-type moves from 1.5x to 2x, or **Poison Touch**, which adds a chance to poison targets upon contact.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Dragalge is the final stage of a three-stage progression. It begins its life as **Skrelp**, a Water/Poison type that relies on camouflaging itself as rotting seaweed. Skrelp undergoes a significant biological shift and evolves into the Poison/Dragon-type **Dragalge** upon reaching **Level 48**. The transition to its Mega form is triggered through the resonance between a Dragalgeite Mega Stone and a Trainer’s Key Stone. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 1 and Dragon** Egg Groups. Despite its dragon-like power, it remains deeply tied to its maritime roots, often found in kelp forests where its brown, leaf-like protrusions allow it to remain hidden from predators and prey alike.
