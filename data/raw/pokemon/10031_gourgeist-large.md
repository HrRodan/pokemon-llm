## Identity & Lore
Large Size Gourgeist (Pokedex #711) is the Pumpkin Pokémon, a spectral entity that first appeared in the Kalos region during Generation VI. This specific variant is the "Large" size, characterized by a bulkier frame and a more menacing presence compared to its smaller counterparts. Its body resembles a carved jack-o'-lantern with long, hair-like fronds extending from its head that it uses like arms. According to Kalosian folklore, Gourgeist wander through town streets on the night of the new moon, singing in eerie, haunting voices; those who hear their melody are said to be cursed. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique biology is defined by its four distinct size variations (Small, Average, Large, and Super), which directly influence its base statistics and competitive utility.

## Evolution & Biology
Gourgeist-Large is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Pumpkaboo (Large Size)** when the Pokémon is **traded** to another trainer. A unique biological trait of this species is that its size is determined at birth and is inherited through breeding; a Large Size Gourgeist will produce Large Size Pumpkaboo. It belongs to the **Amorphous** (Indeterminate) Egg Group. Its biology is deeply tied to its Ghost-typing, as it uses the light from its pumpkin body to lure prey or travelers, while its Grass-type nature is evident in its ability to manipulate seeds and vines for tactical advantage.
