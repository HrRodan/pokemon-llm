## Identity & Lore
Kricketune (Pokedex #402) is the Cricket Pokémon, a Bug-type insectoid introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its violin-like appearance and deep red coloration, this Pokémon is famous for its unique musical abilities. It crosses its knifelike arms in front of its chest to resonate sound, composing complex melodies ad lib that vary based on the rhythm of its arm movements. While often found in forests and lush vegetation, it is historically noted for its distinct, resonant cry. Kricketune does not currently possess any Mega Evolutions, Gigantamax forms, or Paradox variants.
