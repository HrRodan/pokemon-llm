## Identity & Lore
Magearna (Original Color) (Pokedex #10318) is a legendary Artificial Pokémon first introduced in the Alola region (Generation VII). This specific form represents its "Original Color," the vibrant red and gold appearance it possessed over 500 years ago when it was first gifted to a king’s daughter in the Azoth Kingdom. Constructed by a scientist of extraordinary genius, Magearna is a clockwork masterpiece that can perceive the feelings and thoughts of other Pokémon. Its body is a vessel for the "Soul-Heart," an artificial soul created by gathering the life energy of Pokémon. While it cannot speak, it is highly intelligent and capable of understanding human language. Though this specific entry is categorized as a "Mega" variant with enhanced power, Magearna is primarily known as a Mythical Pokémon that does not possess a traditional Gigantamax or Paradox form, though its ability to fold into the shape of a Poké Ball is a core part of its biological defense mechanism.

## Evolution & Biology
Magearna is a standalone Mythical Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain. It does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **No-Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, its metallic shell houses intricate gears and the Soul-Heart at its center. Its slow growth rate reflects the complexity of its mechanical and spiritual composition. Despite its artificial nature, it exhibits nurturing behaviors, often tending to injured Pokémon within its habitat. As a humanoid-shaped construct, it weighs a significant 248.1 kg, a testament to the heavy metals used in its 16th-century construction.
