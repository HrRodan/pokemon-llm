## Identity & Lore
Aggron (Pokedex #306) is the **Iron Armor Pokémon**, a massive bipedal beast introduced in **Generation III (Hoenn)**. Known for its intense territorial instincts, Aggron claims an entire mountain as its domain and mercilessly beats any intruders that violate its environment. It is vigilantly protective, constantly patrolling its habitat in search of threats. While primarily gray and clad in thick steel plating, Aggron is deeply connected to the earth, often restoring its mountain territory by hauling topsoil to areas ravaged by landslides or fire. In battle, it is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Aggron, shedding its Rock typing to become a pure Steel-type fortress.
