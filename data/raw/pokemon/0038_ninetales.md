## Identity & Lore
Ninetales (Pokedex #038) is the Fox Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its mystical aura, this quadrupedal Pokémon possesses a sleek coat of golden-white fur and nine distinctive tails, which are said to be imbued with mystic power. Lore indicates that Ninetales is highly intelligent and vengeful; grabbing one of its tails is said to result in a 1,000-year curse. It typically inhabits grasslands. While the standard form is a Fire-type, Ninetales has a prominent regional variant known as **Alolan Ninetales**, which adapts to snowy mountains as an Ice/Fairy type.

## Evolution & Biology
Ninetales is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Vulpix** when exposed to a **Fire Stone**. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group. While the standard Vulpix evolves via Fire Stone, the Alolan variant requires an Ice Stone to evolve.
