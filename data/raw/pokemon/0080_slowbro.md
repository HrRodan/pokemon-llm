## Identity & Lore
Slowbro (Pokedex #080) is the Hermit Crab Pokémon, a lethargic Water/Psychic-type first discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its pink skin and the spiral Shellder firmly clamped onto its tail, Slowbro inhabits the **water's edge**. Its biology is a unique example of symbiosis; the Shellder feeds on Slowbro's leftover scraps, while the host gains the ability to walk upright due to the counterweight. Though typically dim-witted and insensitive to pain, Slowbro is capable of unleashing powerful psychic energy if the Shellder bites down hard. While this profile focuses on the Kantonian form, the species possesses a **Mega Evolution** (Mega Slowbro) where the shell engulfs its body, and a regional variant, **Galarian Slowbro**, which is a Poison/Psychic-type with the Shellder attached to its arm.

## Evolution & Biology
Slowbro is part of a split 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Slowpoke** starting at **Level 37**. Alternatively, Slowpoke can evolve into Slowking when traded while holding a King's Rock. In the Galar region, exposing a Slowpoke to a **Galarica Cuff** triggers evolution into Galarian Slowbro. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups and has a Hatch Counter of 20. The Shellder on its tail is essential to its form; legend states that if the shell falls off, Slowbro will revert into a Slowpoke.
