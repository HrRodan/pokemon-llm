## Identity & Lore
Tapu Fini (Pokedex #788) is the Land Spirit Pokémon and serves as the guardian deity of Poni Island in the Alola region (Generation VII). This purple, shell-clad legendary entity is known for its ability to manipulate water and create a dense, mystical fog that can induce a state of confusion in its enemies, leading to their downfall. Unlike some of its more hot-headed fellow guardians, Tapu Fini is characterized by its aloof and stoic nature; it is said to have a deep distaste for unnecessary conflict and will often hide within its shell to avoid interaction. Its energy is derived from ocean currents, and it is intrinsically linked to the Ruins of Hope. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a Guardian Deity grants it access to a unique Z-Move, "Guardian of Alola," which manifests as a giant titan.

## Evolution & Biology
Tapu Fini is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary line. It does not evolve from or into any other species. Biologically, it is a genderless entity that belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** group, meaning it cannot be bred. Its shell resembles a swordfish or aquatic mammal when closed, which it uses for both defense and as a vessel for its spiritual energy. Despite its slow growth rate and legendary status, it has a hatch counter of 15, though it is exclusively found in the wild within ancient Alolan ruins.
