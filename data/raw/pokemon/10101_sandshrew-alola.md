## Identity & Lore
Alolan Sandshrew (Pokedex #027) is the Mouse Pokémon, a regional variant adapted to the frigid, snowy peaks of the Alola region. While the species was originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I), this specific form emerged after Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains to escape volcanic eruptions. Its body has evolved to trade its traditional hide for a shell of ice that is as hard as steel. It is typically found in high-altitude, rough terrain where it curls into a ball to slide across ice at high speeds. Unlike its desert-dwelling cousins, this variant's claws allow it to grip frozen surfaces, though it lacks the ability to curl as tightly due to its rigid shell. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its unique Ice/Steel typing makes it a distinct biological anomaly in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 50, Attack 75, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 10, Sp. Def 35, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Hail Sweeper. With a high base Defense for an unevolved Pokémon, it can withstand physical blows, but it relies on weather conditions to overcome its poor Speed.
*   **Type Matchups:** It suffers from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fire and Fighting**, and a standard weakness to **Ground**. It is **immune to Poison** and highly resilient, boasting resistances to **Normal, Flying, Bug, Grass, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, and Fairy** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its physical prowess, Alolan Sandshrew’s optimal moveset includes **Icicle Crash** for heavy STAB damage, **Iron Head** to utilize its Steel typing, **Earthquake** for vital coverage against Fire-types, and **Rapid Spin** to clear entry hazards while boosting its mobility.
*   **Abilities:** **Snow Cloak** (Increases evasiveness during snow or hail, making it harder to hit) and **Slush Rush** (A powerful Hidden Ability that doubles its Speed stat during snow, transforming it into a fast offensive threat).

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Sandshrew is the first stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves into Alolan Sandslash when **exposed to an Ice Stone**. This is a departure from the Kanto form, which evolves via natural growth at level 22. Biologically, it belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group. Its physiological shift to an Ice/Steel type has significantly increased its density, resulting in a weight of 40kg, which is significantly heavier than its desert counterpart. In the wild, they are occasionally found holding a **Grip Claw**, an item that aids their ability to cling to frozen cliffsides during blizzards.
