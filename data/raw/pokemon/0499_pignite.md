## Identity & Lore
Pignite (Pokedex #499) is the Fire Pig Pokémon, a dual-type Fire/Fighting starter originating from the Unova region (Generation V). As the evolved form of the Unova Fire starter, Pignite adopts a bipedal, upright stance and develops a muscular, rotund physique characterized by its red and black coloration. Biologically, this Pokémon functions like a living furnace; the more its internal fire flares up, the sharper and faster its movements become during battle. While it is generally confident, it will emit thick smoke when in trouble or distressed. Pignite is a member of the Field Egg Group (listed as Ground in data sources).

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 93, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 55, Speed 55.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Brawler / Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Ground, Flying, and Psychic** types. Due to its dual typing, it boasts a diverse defensive profile, **resisting Fire, Grass, Ice, Steel, and Dark**, and possessing a **double resistance (0.25x) to Bug** type moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its dominant Attack stat and high HP recoil tolerance, key moves include **Flare Blitz** (high-power STAB), **Close Combat** (fighting STAB coverage), **Wild Charge** (to counter Flying and Water threats), and **Head Smash** (for massive damage against flying types). **Flame Charge** is also viable for boosting its mediocre speed.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Blaze:** Powers up Fire-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Thick Fat (Hidden):** Halves the damage taken from Fire- and Ice-type moves, granting Pignite substantial added durability against these common offensive types.

## Evolution & Biology
Pignite is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Tepig** starting at **Level 17**. Upon reaching **Level 36**, it evolves into the massive **Emboar**. While Pignite is significantly heavier than its pre-evolution, weighing 55.5 kg, it utilizes this mass to execute powerful contact moves like Heat Crash.
