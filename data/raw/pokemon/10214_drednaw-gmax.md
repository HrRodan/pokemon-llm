## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Drednaw (Pokedex #10214) is the colossal Gigantamax form of the Bite Pokémon, a formidable Water/Rock-type native to the Galar region of Generation VIII. While standard Drednaw are known for their aggressive temperament and jaws capable of shearing through steel rods, the Gigantamax transformation causes this Pokémon to stand upright on its hind legs, reaching a staggering height of 24 meters. In this state, it can tuck its massive neck into its shell and then rapidly extend it to strike enemies with the force of a hydraulic press. This specific form is capable of using the unique G-Max Move, **G-Max Stonesurge**, which deals massive damage while simultaneously scattering sharp rocks around the battlefield to function as Stealth Rock.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 90, Attack 115, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 48, Sp. Def 68, Speed 74.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Wallbreaker.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Grass**. It is also weak to **Electric, Fighting, Ground, Steel, and Water**. Conversely, it provides a crucial **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Fire** and resists **Normal, Flying, Poison, and Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high physical Attack stat and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), Gigantamax Drednaw excels with **Liquidation** for reliable water damage, **Stone Edge** for high-impact rock strikes, **Jaw Lock** to trap opponents and benefit from ability boosts, and **Swords Dance** to further amplify its wallbreaking potential.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Strong Jaw:** Increases the power of all biting moves (like Crunch or Jaw Lock) by 50%.
    * **Shell Armor:** Protects the Pokémon from receiving critical hits, enhancing its physical bulk.
    * **Swift Swim (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, transforming it from a slow tank into a terrifying rain-swept sweeper.

## Evolution & Biology
Gigantamax Drednaw is the final pinnacle of a two-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Chewtle**, a small but territorial Pokémon, which evolves into **Drednaw** upon reaching **Level 22**. Only specific Drednaw possessing the "G-Max Factor"—typically encountered in Max Raid Battles within the Galar Wild Area—can achieve this Gigantamax form when Dynamaxing. Biologically, it is a quadrupedal reptilian Pokémon with a jagged, serrated shell. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Water 1** Egg Groups, and while it lacks a Mega Evolution or Paradox form, its Gigantamax state serves as its ultimate competitive transformation.
