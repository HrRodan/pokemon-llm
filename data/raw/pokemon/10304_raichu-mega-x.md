## Identity & Lore
Raichu-Mega-X (Pokedex #10304) is the Mouse Pokémon, a powerful and specialized evolution of the classic Kanto Electric-type. Originally discovered in the forests of the Kanto region (Generation I), this variant represents a massive surge in bio-electric capacity. Its signature long, thin tail is not merely for balance; it serves as a critical grounding mechanism to protect the Pokémon from its own devastating high-voltage output, which can reach levels capable of scorching the earth. While Raichu is known for its orange fur and long ears, the Mega-X form suggests a physical metamorphosis that channels electricity into kinetic force. In addition to this Mega form, the species is also known for its Alolan variant, which gains Psychic powers and the ability to surf on its own tail.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 135, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 90, Sp. Def 95, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Sweeper. With a massive base Attack of 135 and a high Speed tier of 110, Raichu-Mega-X is designed to outspeed most opponents and deliver crushing physical blows.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Ground**. It provides valuable **resistances to Electric, Flying, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its elite physical prowess, Raichu-Mega-X excels with high-impact physical strikes and utility:
    1. **Volt Tackle:** A high-recoil signature move that leverages its 135 Attack for maximum damage.
    2. **Thunder Punch:** A reliable, non-recoil alternative for consistent Electric-type physical damage.
    3. **Fake Out:** Excellent for flinching opponents upon entry and securing "chip" damage.
    4. **Brick Break or Knock Off:** Vital coverage for hitting Steel or Ghost types and removing opponent held items.
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-X abilities are often associated with energy redirection, it likely utilizes **Static** (to paralyze attackers on contact) or **Lightning Rod** (to absorb electrical surges and boost its power).

## Evolution & Biology
Raichu-Mega-X is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Pichu**, a baby Pokémon that **evolves into Pikachu when leveled up with High Friendship (220+)**. Pikachu then **evolves into Raichu when exposed to a Thunder Stone**. The transition to Mega-X is a temporary combat-state triggered by a specialized Mega Stone. Biologically, it belongs to the **Ground and Fairy** Egg Groups, showing a surprising ancestral link to smaller, magical creatures and burrowing mammals. It has a medium growth rate and is primarily found in forest habitats where it can safely discharge electricity into the trees and soil.
