## Identity & Lore
Huntail (Pokedex #367) is the Deep Sea Pokémon, a predatory serpent first identified in Generation III (Hoenn). A dweller of the extreme ocean depths, this Water-type went unnoticed by humanity for a long time due to its habitat in the pitch-black abyss. Its biology is perfectly adapted to high-pressure environments, featuring thick blue skin and eyes capable of seeing clearly even in the murky, lightless depths of the sea. While it resembles a deep-sea eel, it swims with a serpentine motion. Huntail uses its fish-shaped tail to lure prey before striking, utilizing its powerful jaws to crunch through shells and bones.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 104, Defense 105, Sp. Atk 94, Sp. Def 75, Speed 52.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Setup Sweeper / Mixed Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Ice, Steel, and Water** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Huntail's viability relies heavily on its access to the premier setup move, **Shell Smash**, which doubles its offenses and speed at the cost of defenses. To capitalize on its high Attack stat (104), its moveset should include **Waterfall** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Sucker Punch** to bypass its naturally low speed with priority, and **Ice Fang** for coverage against Grass and Dragon types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat when it is raining, making Huntail extremely dangerous in Rain Dance teams.
    *   **Water Veil (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn. This is tactically significant for Huntail, as burns typically halve the Attack stat of physical attackers.

## Evolution & Biology
Huntail is part of a split 2-stage evolutionary line originating from Clamperl. It evolves from **Clamperl** specifically when **traded while holding a Deep Sea Tooth**. This evolution method distinguishes it from Gorebyss, which Clamperl evolves into when traded with a Deep Sea Scale. In the wild, Huntail can occasionally be found holding the Deep Sea Tooth item. It belongs to the **Water 1** Egg Group and has a slow-then-very-fast growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach high levels initially.
