## Identity & Lore
Salandit (Pokedex #757) is the Toxic Lizard Pokémon, a distinctive species first discovered in the Alola region during Generation VII. This small, black, quadrupedal lizard is primarily found in volcanic environments like Wela Volcano Park, where it thrives in harsh heat. Salandit is biologically unique for its ability to burn its own bodily fluids to produce a sweet-smelling but lethal poisonous gas. This gas is used to disorient foes and prey; once the target inhales the toxins, Salandit strikes with precision. While Salandit itself does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it is famous for its restrictive evolutionary biology and its role in the social hierarchy of volcanic caves, where males are often seen serving a dominant female Salazzle.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 48, Attack 44, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 71, Sp. Def 40, Speed 77.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper (Early-game/Little Cup).
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from a devastating **Double Weakness (4x) to Ground**, and is also **weak to Psychic, Rock, and Water**. Conversely, it is highly resilient, boasting **quadruple resistances (0.25x) to Grass, Fairy, and Bug**, while also resisting **Fire, Poison, Fighting, Steel, and Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Salandit excels when utilizing its superior Special Attack and Speed. Key moves include **Sludge Bomb** and **Flamethrower** for powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage, **Nasty Plot** to sharply boost its offensive pressure, and **Dragon Pulse** for valuable type coverage against Dragon-types. 
* **Abilities:** **Corrosion** is its signature ability, a game-changing tactical tool that allows Salandit to inflict the Poisoned or Badly Poisoned status on traditionally immune Steel and Poison-type Pokémon. Its Hidden Ability, **Oblivious**, protects it from being infatuated or intimidated by Taunt, ensuring it can execute its utility moves without interruption.

## Evolution & Biology
Salandit is part of a two-stage evolutionary line, but its progression is famously gender-dependent. It evolves into **Salazzle** starting at **Level 33**, but **only if the Salandit is female**. Male Salandit are biologically incapable of evolving, likely due to a lack of nutrients caused by their subservient behavior toward females. Because female Salandit are significantly rarer than males, obtaining its evolved form is a noted challenge for trainers. Biologically, Salandit belongs to the **Monster and Dragon Egg Groups**, and it typically takes about 20 hatch counters (approx. 5,120 steps) for an egg to hatch. In the wild, they are occasionally found holding a **Smoke Ball**, an item that mirrors their natural ability to create distracting gases for a quick escape.
