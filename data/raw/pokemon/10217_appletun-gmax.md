## Identity & Lore
Gigantamax Appletun (Pokedex #10217) is the Apple Nectar Pokémon, a colossal transformation of the species first discovered in the Galar region (Generation VIII). Standing at a towering 24 meters, its body is saturated with a thick, sweet nectar that has been super-concentrated by the power of Gigantamaxing. This nectar is so potent that it emits a powerful, alluring scent capable of drawing in bug Pokémon from miles away. While standard Appletun are known for their pie-like appearance and sedentary nature, this Gigantamax form is draped in an overflowing amount of nectar that has hardened into a protective, delicious shell. It is the counterpart to Gigantamax Flapple; while Flapple represents the tartness and speed of an apple, Appletun embodies the sweetness and bulk of a nectar-filled dessert.

* **G-Max Move:** In this form, its Grass-type attacks transform into **G-Max Sweetness**, which deals massive damage and heals the status conditions of Appletun and its allies.

## Evolution & Biology
Appletun-Gmax is the final Gigantamax stage of a branched three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Applin**, a small dragon-like creature that hides inside an apple. Applin evolves into **Appletun** specifically when exposed to a **Sweet Apple** (exclusive to the Galar region's ecosystem). While recently discovered evolutions like Dipplin and Hydrapple have been found in the Paldea region, the Appletun line remains unique for its symbiotic relationship with sweet nectar. It belongs to the **Plant and Dragon** Egg Groups and is known for its "Slow-then-Very-Fast" growth rate. Biologically, its nectar is not just for defense; it is a primary source of nourishment and a lure for the bug-type Pokémon that it occasionally preys upon.
