## Identity & Lore
Luvdisc (Pokedex #370) is the Rendezvous Pokémon, first discovered in the tropical waters of the **Hoenn** region (Generation III). This flat, heart-shaped fish is strictly aquatic and is famous for its vibrant pink coloration. Luvdisc inhabits shallow seas in the tropics and is biologically compelled to swim after loving couples it spots in the ocean waves, leading sailors to view spotting one as a sign of eternal love. Despite its resemblance to the Unovan Pokémon Alomomola, there is no biological or evolutionary connection between the two species. In the wild, Luvdisc is highly sought after by trainers not for its combat abilities, but because it frequently holds a **Heart Scale**, a rare item used to help Pokémon relearn forgotten moves.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 43, Attack 30, Defense 55, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 65, Speed 97.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Support / Rain Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water-type**, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Ice, Steel, and Water** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Luvdisc possesses negligible offensive stats but high Speed, making it suited for disruption rather than direct damage. Key moves include **Rain Dance** (to trigger its ability), **Charm** (to drastically lower opponent Attack), **Sweet Kiss** (to confuse targets), and **Scald** (for STAB damage and a chance to burn the opponent).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, allowing Luvdisc to outspeed almost any unboosted opponent.
    *   **Hydration (Hidden):** Heals all status conditions at the end of the turn if it is raining.

## Evolution & Biology
Luvdisc is a standalone species and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. Despite persistent rumors regarding its relationship to Alomomola due to their shared heart motif and typing, they are distinct species. Luvdisc belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and hatches relatively quickly.
