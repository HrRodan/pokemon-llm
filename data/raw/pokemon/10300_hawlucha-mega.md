## Identity & Lore
Mega Hawlucha (Pokedex #10300) is the Wrestling Pokémon, a specialized Mega Evolution of the Kalos-native species Hawlucha. Originally discovered in the Generation VI (Kalos) region, this Fighting and Flying-type combatant is renowned for its colorful, luchador-inspired appearance and its unique tactical approach to battle. Despite its relatively small stature of 1.0 meter, Mega Hawlucha possesses refined fighting techniques that allow it to overpower massive opponents like Machamp, Hariyama, and Buzzwole. In its base form, Hawlucha is known for its flamboyant style, often posing gracefully in the air before delivering a finishing blow; upon Mega Evolving, its physical prowess and speed are heightened to a professional championship level. While it does not have a Gigantamax form, its Mega Evolution represents the pinnacle of its aerial wrestling mastery.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 78, Attack 137, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 74, Sp. Def 93, Speed 118.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper. With a massive Base 137 Attack and a blistering 118 Speed, Mega Hawlucha is designed to outspeed most of the unboosted metagame and deliver crushing physical hits.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Psychic, Fairy, Rock, Electric, and Ice**. Conversely, it **resists Fighting, Bug, Grass, and Dark-type moves**, and it possesses a total **immunity to Ground-type attacks**, allowing it to switch safely into Earthquakes.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Attack stat, Mega Hawlucha excels with high-impact physical maneuvers. Key moves include **High Jump Kick** for massive Fighting-type damage, **Brave Bird** for powerful Flying-type STAB, **Swords Dance** to further boost its sweeping potential, and **Iron Head** to provide crucial coverage against Fairy-type threats.
* **Abilities:** While specific Mega-form abilities vary, the base species utilizes **Unburden** (doubling speed when an item is lost), **Limber** (preventing paralysis), and the hidden ability **Mold Breaker** (ignoring opponent's defensive abilities). Upon Mega Evolution, it typically trades the speed of Unburden for the raw stat increases provided by its Mega Stone.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Hawlucha is a temporary transformation of Hawlucha, which is a single-stage evolutionary line with no pre-evolutions or natural further evolutions. The transition to this form is triggered during battle when Hawlucha holds a specific Mega Stone. Biologically, it is a humanoid avian creature that belongs to the **Flying** and **Humanshape** Egg Groups, requiring approximately 20 hatch cycles to produce offspring. It is highly competitive by nature, often living in forest canopies where it hones its "Flying Press" technique. Its green, red, and white plumage serves as both a warning to rivals and a display of its status within the mountainous regions it calls home.
