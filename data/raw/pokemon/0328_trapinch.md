## Identity & Lore
Trapinch (Pokedex #328) is the Ground-type Ant Pit Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). This creature typically inhabits arid deserts and **rough-terrain** environments, where it digs sloped, bowl-like pits in the sand to function as natural traps. Its orange-brown carapace resembles a helmet, shielding it while it waits patiently at the bottom of its burrow for prey to stumble in. Biologically based on the larval form of an antlion, Trapinch possesses disproportionately large, serrated jaws capable of crushing boulders. Despite its insectoid behavior and appearance, it is a precursor to a powerful Dragon-type lineage.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 100, Defense 45, Sp. Atk 45, Sp. Def 45, Speed 10.
*   **Archetype:** Slow Physical Wallbreaker / Trick Room Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Ground-type, it is **weak to Water, Grass, and Ice**. It **resists Poison and Rock** and possesses a total **immunity to Electric-type** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** With a massive Attack stat but abysmal Speed, Trapinch functions best with heavy-hitting physical moves. Its optimal kit includes **Earthquake** (powerful STAB), **First Impression** (high-priority Bug-type damage), **Rock Slide** (coverage against Flying-types), and **Crunch** or **Superpower**.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Hyper Cutter:** Prevents the Pokémon's Attack stat from being lowered (e.g., by Intimidate).
    *   **Arena Trap:** Prevents opposing grounded Pokémon from fleeing or switching out.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden):** Removes additional effects from attacks to increase their base power by 30%.

## Evolution & Biology
Trapinch is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Vibrava** starting at **Level 35**, at which point it gains the Dragon type and the Levitate ability. It reaches its final form, **Flygon**, starting at **Level 45**. Trapinch falls under the **Bug** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, reflecting its biological metamorphosis from an antlion larva into a dragon-like adult.
