## Identity & Lore
School Form Wishiwashi (Pokedex #10127) is the massive, collective manifestation of the Small Fry Pokémon, a unique biological phenomenon first discovered in the Alola region of Generation VII. While an individual Wishiwashi is tiny and fragile, it possesses a specialized ability to send out a distress signal when threatened, moistening its eyes to create a shining light that summons its comrades. Together, they aggregate into this gargantuan "School Form," which is so intimidating that even Gyarados are known to flee from its presence. Measuring over 26 feet in length, this blue, fish-like titan is often referred to as the "Demon of the Sea." Although it does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox counterpart, its "Schooling" transformation serves as one of the most dramatic power shifts in the Pokémon world, turning a weakling into a literal sea monster.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 140, Defense 130, Sp. Atk 140, Sp. Def 135, Speed 30.
* **Archetype:** Mixed Tank / Trick Room Sweeper. Despite its abysmal Speed and low HP pool, its offensive and defensive stats are legendary, rivaling those of Pseudo-Legendary Pokémon.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Water-type**, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its massive equalized offensive stats (140 Atk/140 Sp. Atk), Wishiwashi excels with high-powered coverage:
    * **Hydro Pump:** A devastating STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) special attack to capitalize on its high Special Attack.
    * **Earthquake:** Essential physical coverage to deal with Electric-type threats.
    * **Ice Beam:** A special-categorical move to check Grass-type weaknesses and Dragon-types.
    * **Flip Turn:** A tactical physical pivoting move that allows Wishiwashi to deal damage and switch out before its HP drops too low.
* **Abilities:** Schooling (The Pokémon forms a school when it enters battle at Level 20 or higher, provided its HP is above 25%. If its health falls below this threshold, the school disperses, and it reverts to its weak Solo Form).

## Evolution & Biology
Wishiwashi is a single-stage Pokémon that does not evolve into another species; however, it undergoes a radical **Form Change** governed by its biology. The transition to the School Form occurs automatically at the start of a turn or battle if Wishiwashi is at least **Level 20** and maintains more than **one-quarter of its maximum health**. Biologically, the school is held together by a shared consciousness and a drive for survival. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and has a relatively fast growth rate, though it requires careful management in battle to prevent it from reverting to its vulnerable Solo Form. While it lacks a standard evolution chain, its survival strategy is among the most sophisticated in the marine ecosystems of Alola and Galar.
