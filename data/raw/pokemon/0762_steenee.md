## Identity & Lore
Steenee (Pokedex #762) is the Fruit Pokémon, a vibrant Grass-type originally discovered in the tropical Alola region of Generation VII. This purple-hued, humanoid Pokémon is characterized by the toughened sepals on its head, which have evolved into a hard, protective canopy. These sepals are so resilient that Steenee is notoriously unfazed by the pecking of bird Pokémon, often using its head to counter-attack or play. While Steenee itself does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, it serves as the vital energetic midpoint of its evolutionary line, known for its tomboyish and bouncy personality. Its scent is noticeably more fragrant than its predecessor, Bounsweet, though it no longer lives in constant fear of being eaten by predators.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 52, Attack 40, Defense 48, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 48, Speed 62.
* **Archetype:** Eviolite Utility Support. With its balanced but modest defensive stats and a higher Speed tier than its offensive stats, Steenee functions best in middle-evolution formats as a disruption specialist.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Grass-type, it is **weak to Fire, Ice, Poison, Flying, and Bug**. It effectively **resists Water, Electric, Grass, and Ground** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Steenee utilizes its utility and physical movepool to control the pace of battle. Key moves include **Stomp** (essential for its growth), **Rapid Spin** (to clear entry hazards), **Giga Drain** (for sustain), and **Knock Off** (to remove opponent held items). It can also utilize **Triple Axel** and **Play Rough** for surprising physical coverage.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Leaf Guard:** Prevents the Pokémon from being afflicted by non-volatile status conditions during harsh sunlight.
    * **Oblivious:** Grants immunity to being Infatuated, Taunted, or affected by Intimidate, making it a reliable support choice.
    * **Sweet Veil (Hidden):** A valuable supportive ability that prevents Steenee and its allies from falling asleep, hard-countering moves like Spore and Sleep Powder.

## Evolution & Biology
Steenee is the second stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bounsweet** starting at Level 18. The transition to its final form, the regal **Tsareena**, is unique: Steenee must **level up while knowing the move Stomp** (which it typically learns at level 28 or 29). This evolution represents Steenee "toughening up" and gaining the strength to protect others. Biologically, it belongs to the **Plant** egg group and has a hatch counter of 20, requiring a moderate amount of steps to hatch. It is frequently found carrying a **Grassy Seed**, which boosts its defense when Grassy Terrain is active, reflecting its deep connection to its forest habitat.
