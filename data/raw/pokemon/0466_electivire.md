## Identity & Lore
Electivire (Pokedex #466) is the Thunderbolt Pokémon, a formidable Electric-type introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its bipedal stance, yellow fur with black stripes, and two distinct tails, this Pokémon is capable of generating massive amounts of electricity. Lore dictates that Electivire pushes the tips of its two tails against foes to discharge over 20,000 volts of power. When its electric charge amplifies to its peak, blue sparks violently crackle between the horns on its head. It is often found near power plants, feeding on electric currents. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the fully evolved form of the Elekid line, representing a mastery of physical electrical combat.
