## Identity & Lore
Hypno (Pokédex #097) is the Hypnosis Pokémon, a bipedal, humanoid creature first discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Known for its bright yellow coloring and white fur collar, Hypno is infamous in folklore and biological studies for carrying a pendulum-like device in its hand. It uses a rhythmic swinging motion to induce deep sleep in its prey, allowing it to feast on their dreams. While primarily found in **grasslands**, it often wanders near human settlements, leading to unsettling urban legends regarding its interactions with children. This Pokémon possesses no known Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms.
