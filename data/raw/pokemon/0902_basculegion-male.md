## Identity & Lore
Basculegion-Male (Pokedex #902) is the Big Fish Pokémon, a powerful Water and Ghost-type first discovered in the Hisui region during the Generation VIII era. Standing at 3.0 meters and weighing 110.0 kilograms, this massive fish is distinguished by its green coloration and its haunting, spectral appearance. According to Hisuian lore, a Basculin evolves into this form when it is possessed by the restless souls of its own kind—comrades who perished while attempting the perilous journey upstream. These spirits provide Basculegion with relentless energy, making it a species without equal in the rivers of ancient Sinnoh. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its existence as a regional evolution of the White-Striped Basculin makes it a unique biological anomaly compared to the Red and Blue-Striped variants found in other regions like Unova or Kalos.

## Combat Profile

* **Move Selection:** Basculegion-Male leverages its high HP and physical Attack to overwhelm opponents.

* **Abilities:** **Swift Swim** doubles its Speed in the Rain, transforming it into a dangerous sweeper; **Adaptability** increases the Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB) from 1.5x to 2.0x, providing immense damage output; **Mold Breaker** (Hidden Ability) allows its attacks to ignore the defensive abilities of opponents, such as Sturdy or Unaware.

## Evolution & Biology
Basculegion-Male is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the White-Striped Basculin found in the Hisui region. The evolution is triggered through a unique biological process where the Basculin must sustain at least 294 points of recoil damage (from moves like Wave Crash or Double-Edge) without fainting. This physical strain allows the souls of fallen Basculin to merge with the survivor, granting it a new, spectral form. Biologically, the male variant is identified by its reddish-pink soul-glow and higher physical Attack stat compared to the female counterpart. It belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and is known for its aggressive, relentless nature when swimming against the current or defending its territory.
