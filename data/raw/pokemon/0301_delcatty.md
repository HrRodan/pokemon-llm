## Identity & Lore
Delcatty (Pokedex #301) is the Prim Pokémon, a refined and independent creature introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A quadrupedal feline with purple fur, it is characterized by its carefree disposition; it strictly prioritizes its own comfort, eating and sleeping at random intervals rather than following a set routine. Because it prefers an unfettered existence, Delcatty generally avoids conflict and inhabits peaceful forests. It is the final evolutionary form of Skitty and is often associated with high society and Pokémon Contests due to its elegant appearance.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 65, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 55, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility / Cleric.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Normal** type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses an **immunity to Ghost** type moves. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Speed and slightly higher Attack, Delcatty functions best with a disruption and physical set including **Fake Out** (for immediate flinching), **Double-Edge** (strong STAB damage), **Sucker Punch** (priority coverage), and **Play Rough** (for coverage against Fighting-types). Alternatively, it effectively utilizes **Heal Bell** for team support.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Cute Charm:** Contact with this Pokémon has a 30% chance of inducing infatuation in attackers of the opposite gender.
    *   **Normalize:** A signature mechanics-altering ability that changes the typing of all known moves to Normal-type, granting them Same Type Attack Bonus (STAB) but rendering them ineffective against Ghost-types.
    *   **Wonder Skin (Hidden Ability):** Makes status moves (like Toxic or Thunder Wave) more likely to miss against this Pokémon.

## Evolution & Biology
Delcatty is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Skitty** when exposed to a **Moon Stone**. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** and **Fairy** Egg Groups. Delcatty maintains the playful demeanor of its pre-evolution but adopts a more nocturnal and whimsical lifestyle, often settling in clean, comfortable spots to rest.
