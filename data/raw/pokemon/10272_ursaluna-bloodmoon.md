## Identity & Lore
Bloodmoon Ursaluna (Pokedex #10272) is the Peat Pokémon, a specialized and rare variant of the Ursaluna species first discovered in the Hisui region (Generation VIII). While standard Ursaluna are known for their burly physique and ability to manipulate peat in swampy terrains, the Bloodmoon form is a unique individual that survived a journey across the sea to the Kitakami region in Generation IX. This specific specimen has undergone a distinct physiological change, characterized by a hardened, stony coating of mud and a crimson, moon-like pattern on its forehead. Unlike its Hisuian cousins, this form has adapted to utilize its spiritual and mental energy for devastating special attacks. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its status as a singular, ancient survivor makes it comparable in presence to Paradox Pokémon or Legendary encounters.

## Combat Profile

* **Abilities:** Mind's Eye (This unique ability allows the Pokémon to hit Ghost-types with Normal- and Fighting-type moves; it also prevents its accuracy from being lowered and ignores the target's evasiveness).

## Evolution & Biology
Bloodmoon Ursaluna is part of a three-stage evolutionary line, though the Bloodmoon form itself is currently known as a unique, non-evolving variant of the final stage. The lineage begins with **Teddiursa**, which evolves into **Ursaring** starting at Level 30. In the Hisui region, Ursaring evolves into a standard **Ursaluna** when exposed to a **Peat Block** during a **Full Moon**. The Bloodmoon variant is a specific Ursaring that drifted to the Timeless Woods of Kitakami and aged over centuries, gaining its unique "Bloodmoon" traits through survival and environmental adaptation. It belongs to the **Ground** egg group and is a heavy, quadrupedal organism weighing 290kg, perfectly adapted for endurance and heavy-hitting special resonance.
