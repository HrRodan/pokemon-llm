## Identity & Lore
Unfezant (Pokedex #521) is the Proud Pokémon, a dual-type Normal and Flying avian species first discovered in the Unova region (Generation V). This Pokémon is notable for its extreme sexual dimorphism: males possess elaborate, ribbon-like pink head plumage used to intimidate rivals and attract mates, while females lack this ornamentation but are scientifically recognized for their superior flight endurance. As the final evolution of the Unova region's common bird line, Unfezant is a staple of the territorial skies, often found in forests and meadows. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its role as a versatile aerial scout is well-established in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 115, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 55, Speed 93.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Critical-Hit Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Rock, Electric, and Ice**. It **resists Bug and Grass**, and possesses complete **immunity to Ghost and Ground** moves. Note: Its dual typing neutralizes the traditional Flying-type weakness to Fighting and the Normal-type weakness to Fighting.
* **Move Selection:** With a formidable base Attack of 115, Unfezant excels with high-impact physical maneuvers. Key moves include **Brave Bird** (its strongest STAB option), **Sky Attack** (which synergizes perfectly with critical-hit builds), **Facade** (capitalizing on status conditions), and **U-turn** (providing essential pivot momentum). For utility, **Roost** or **Tailwind** are often employed to manage its longevity and team speed.
* **Abilities:** **Super Luck** increases the critical-hit ratio, making it a dangerous threat when paired with high-crit moves; **Big Pecks** prevents the Pokémon's Defense stat from being lowered; **Rivalry** (Hidden Ability) increases damage against Pokémon of the same gender but reduces it against the opposite gender.

## Evolution & Biology
Unfezant is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Pidove**, a docile city-dwelling bird, which evolves into **Tranquill** starting at Level 21. The cycle completes when Tranquill reaches **Level 32**, evolving into Unfezant. Biologically, Unfezant are highly territorial and proud; males will swing their head plumage aggressively to threaten anyone entering their space. They belong to the **Flying** egg group and have a hatch counter of 15, indicating a moderate breeding cycle. Their growth rate is medium-slow, requiring dedicated training to reach their full physical potential.
