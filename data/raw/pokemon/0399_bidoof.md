## Identity & Lore
Bidoof (Pokédex #399) is the Normal-type Plump Mouse Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Characterized by its stout, brown body and prominent front teeth, Bidoof is widely recognized for its placid demeanor and "nerves of steel," meaning very little can perturb it emotionally. While it appears slow and dull-witted, it is surprisingly agile and active. Biologically, Bidoof must constantly gnaw on logs and rocks to keep its front teeth from growing too long, a behavior that often leads it to construct dams near water. While initially dismissed by trainers for its low base power, Bidoof has achieved a cult status within the Pokémon community, often jokingly referred to as a "deity" or relied upon heavily as a utility support (HM user) in earlier games.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 59, Attack 45, Defense 40, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 40, Speed 31.
* **Archetype:** Little Cup Physical Setup Sweeper / Evasion Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a valuable **immunity to Ghost**. As a pure Normal type, it has no natural resistances.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its Physical Attack and synergy with stat-boosting abilities, key moves include **Swords Dance** (doubles attack sharply), **Hyper Fang** (STAB damage), **Superpower** (Fighting-type coverage), and **Crunch** (Ghost/Psychic coverage).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Simple:** Doubles the effect of stat changes. For example, using Swords Dance raises Attack by 4 stages instead of 2.
    *   **Unaware:** Ignores any stat changes on the opponent when attacking or being attacked.
    *   **Moody (Hidden Ability):** At the end of every turn, one stat rises sharply (by 2 stages) and another falls (by 1 stage), making Bidoof unpredictable and potentially dangerous over time.

## Evolution & Biology
Bidoof is the first stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Bibarel** when leveled up to **Level 15**. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Ground** Egg Groups, allowing it to breed with a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial Pokémon.
