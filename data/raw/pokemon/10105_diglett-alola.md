## Identity & Lore
Alolan Diglett (Pokedex #050) is the Mole Pokémon, a regional Steel/Ground-type variant of the classic Kanto species discovered in the Alola region (Generation VII). While its Kanto counterpart is purely Ground-type, Alolan Diglett evolved to navigate the volcanic, mineral-rich soils of the Alolan islands, resulting in the growth of thin, golden whiskers that are actually made of a flexible metallic substance. These whiskers serve as sensors, allowing it to communicate with others without emerging from the ground. Despite its small stature, measuring only 0.2 meters, its presence is a sign of healthy soil. While Alolan Diglett does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares a biological resemblance to the convergent species Wiglett found in the Paldea region.

## Evolution & Biology
Alolan Diglett is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Alolan Dugtrio** upon reaching **Level 26**. Biologically, Alolan Diglett is categorized under the **Field** (Ground) egg group. It is often found in cave environments or near volcanic regions where the soil is rich in metallic nutrients. In the wild, they are known to occasionally carry **Soft Sand**, which boosts the power of Ground-type moves. Its behavior is primarily subterranean, feeding on plant roots and rarely surfacing, though its metallic whiskers are often visible above the soil line, glistening in the Alolan sun.
