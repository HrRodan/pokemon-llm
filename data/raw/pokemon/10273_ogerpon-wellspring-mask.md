## Identity & Lore
Wellspring Mask Ogerpon (Pokedex #10273) is a legendary Mask Pokémon that debuted in Generation IX within the Land of Kitakami (associated with the Paldea region). This specific form is achieved when Ogerpon dons the Wellspring Mask, altering its primary appearance and elemental affinity to a dual Grass/Water type. Historically, Ogerpon is a misunderstood figure in Kitakami lore, once feared as an "ogre" but later revealed to be a loyal protector. The Wellspring Mask is imbued with the power of a clear spring, allowing Ogerpon to confound its enemies with nimble, fluid movements and powerful kicks. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it features a unique Terastal phenomenon: when Terastallized, it undergoes a transformation known as "Embody Aspect," where its mask grows to a massive size and its stats are significantly bolstered.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 120, Defense 84, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 96, Speed 110.
* **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper / Bulky Offense. 
* **Type Matchups:** Its unique Grass/Water typing provides excellent defensive utility. It is **weak to Flying, Poison, and Bug**. However, it neutralizes common weaknesses; for instance, its Water typing negates the Fire and Ice weaknesses of Grass, while its Grass typing negates the Electric and Grass weaknesses of Water. It **resists Steel and Ground**.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its high physical Attack and signature mechanics, its optimal moveset includes **Ivy Cudgel** (which becomes a high-crit Water-type move in this form), **Horn Leech** (providing STAB damage and health sustain), **Swords Dance** (to boost its sweeping potential), and **Play Rough** (for essential Fairy-type coverage against Dragon types).
* **Abilities:** **Water Absorb** (Provides a complete immunity to Water-type moves, restoring 25% of its maximum HP when hit by one). Upon Terastallizing, its ability shifts to **Embody Aspect**, which grants a dedicated boost to its Special Defense, making it exceptionally difficult to take down with special strikes.

## Evolution & Biology
Ogerpon is a single-stage Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve from or into any other species. Its biology is defined by its mask-based metamorphosis; while its base form is pure Grass-type, the Wellspring Mask grants it the Water-type sub-element. It belongs to the **No Eggs Discovered** egg group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity. Biologically, it is a humanoid creature that stores different elemental energies within its collection of masks. It has a slow growth rate, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential, and is characterized by a high base happiness, reflecting its deep bond with those it trusts.
