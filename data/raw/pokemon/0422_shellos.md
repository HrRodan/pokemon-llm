## Identity & Lore
Shellos (Pokedex #422) is the Sea Slug Pokémon, a pure Water-type introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its unique biological polymorphism, Shellos appears in two distinct geographic forms determined by its birth location relative to the Sinnoh region's Mt. Coronet: the pink **West Sea Form** and the blue **East Sea Form**. While functionally identical in combat, these forms possess distinct horn shapes and coloration patterns. It inhabits ocean shores and shallow waters, where its soft, squishy body can be easily injured, causing it to release a purple, fluid-like substance as a defense mechanism. While it does not possess Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its regional variance is a key subject of study in Pokémon biology.

## Combat Profile

## Evolution & Biology
Shellos is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Gastrodon** starting at **Level 30**. The form Shellos takes (West Sea or East Sea) is permanently retained upon evolution. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Groups, requiring approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch.
