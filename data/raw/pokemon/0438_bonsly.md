## Identity & Lore
Bonsly (Pokedex #438) is the Bonsai Pokémon, a deceptive Rock-type entity introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. While it mimics the appearance of a small, potted plant or bonsai tree to blend into vegetation, its body is composed of hard, brown rock. Despite its crying appearance, Bonsly is not truly sad; it expels excess moisture through its eyes to maintain its body's fluid levels, a necessity given its aversion to water. As a **Baby Pokémon**, it is often found in dry areas where it can camouflage itself against greenery while avoiding dampness. Though native to Sinnoh, it famously appeared early in the Orre region (*Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*) before its official mainline debut.

## Evolution & Biology
Bonsly is the first stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Sudowoodo** when leveled up while knowing the move **Mimic**. As a Baby Pokémon, it belongs to the **No Eggs** group and cannot breed itself; to obtain a Bonsly via breeding, a parent Sudowoodo must hold a **Rock Incense** in the nursery. If the incense is not held, the egg will hatch directly into Sudowoodo.
