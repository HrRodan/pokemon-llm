## Identity & Lore
Excadrill (Pokedex #530) is the Subterrene Pokémon, a formidable Ground and Steel-type originally discovered in the Unova region of Generation V. This bipedal, mole-like creature is defined by its massive, blade-like claws and a matching steel crest on its head, which it can fold together to transform its entire body into a high-speed rotating drill. Highly valued in the construction industry, Excadrill is capable of boring through thick iron plates and creating complex tunnel systems over 300 feet below the surface. While it does not currently possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant, its raw power and unique typing have cemented it as a legendary "pseudo-staple" in competitive play. Its gray and red-marked fur provides camouflage in the dark, rocky caverns and construction sites it calls home.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 110, Attack 135, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 50, Sp. Def 65, Speed 88.
* **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Sand Sweeper. With a massive Attack stat and high HP, Excadrill functions as a primary offensive threat that can capitalize on weather conditions to outpace the entire metagame.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fire, Water, Fighting, and Ground**. It possesses a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Rock** and is completely **immune to Electric and Poison**. It also resists Normal, Flying, Bug, Steel, Psychic, Dragon, and Fairy types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its elite Attack stat, Excadrill utilizes high-impact physical maneuvers and vital utility:
    * **Earthquake:** Its primary Ground-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, dealing massive damage to grounded opponents.
    * **Iron Head:** A reliable Steel-type STAB that offers a 30% flinch chance, which is especially deadly when Excadrill outspeeds the foe.
    * **Rock Slide:** Essential coverage to hit Flying-types that are immune to its Ground moves, forming the famous "Edge-Quake" coverage duo.
    * **Rapid Spin:** A critical utility move that clears entry hazards (like Stealth Rock and Spikes) from the field while simultaneously boosting Excadrill's Speed.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Sand Rush:** Doubles Excadrill's Speed during a Sandstorm, making it one of the fastest threats in the history of the Unova meta.
    * **Sand Force:** Increases the power of Rock, Ground, and Steel moves by 30% in a Sandstorm.
    * **Mold Breaker (Hidden):** Allows Excadrill’s moves to ignore the defensive abilities of others, enabling it to hit Pokémon like Rotom-Wash (Levitate) with Earthquake or bypass Sturdy.

## Evolution & Biology
Excadrill is the final stage of a two-part evolutionary line. It evolves from **Drilbur** once it reaches **Level 31**. Biologically, the transition to Excadrill represents a massive hardening of its claws and snout into specialized steel alloys capable of enduring extreme heat and pressure. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group and is known to be a dedicated worker, often forming symbiotic relationships with humans to clear paths for subways and mines. Despite its relatively short stature of 0.7 meters, its muscular build and 40.4 kg weight allow it to generate enough torque to shatter solid bedrock.
