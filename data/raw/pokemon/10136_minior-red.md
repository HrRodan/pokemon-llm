## Identity & Lore
Minior (Pokedex #10136) is the Meteor Pokémon, a unique celestial being that originated in the Alola region of Generation VII. This specific specimen represents the Red Core form, though Minior are known to appear in seven distinct colors (Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet) depending on the composition of the cosmic dust they consume while living in the ozone layer. Encased in a heavy, rocky exoskeleton known as its "Meteor Form," Minior hurtles toward the planet's surface once its shell becomes too dense to maintain flight. While it lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its biological gimmick is centered around its **Shields Down** ability, which fundamentally alters its physical state during combat.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 100, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 100, Sp. Def 60, Speed 120.
* **Archetype:** Fast Mixed Sweeper / Setup Sweeper.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Water, Electric, Ice, Steel, and Rock**. It possesses a vital **Immunity to Ground** and resists Normal, Fire, Poison, and Flying, while maintaining a **Double Resistance (1/4x) to Bug**.
* **Move Selection:** Minior is a premier user of **Shell Smash**, which lowers its defenses to drastically boost its already high offensive stats. Capitalizing on its balanced offenses, key moves include **Acrobatics** (which doubles in power if Minior is not holding an item, often consumed via White Herb), **Power Gem** for special STAB, **Earthquake** for vital coverage against Steel types, and **Stone Edge** for high-crit physical pressure.
* **Abilities:** Shields Down (The Pokémon stays in its sturdy Meteor Form while above 50% HP, granting it high defenses and immunity to status conditions. Once its HP drops below half, the shell shatters to reveal the Core Form, swapping its high defenses for the high Speed and offensive stats listed above).

## Evolution & Biology
Minior is part of a single-stage evolutionary line and does not evolve into or from any other species. However, it exists in two distinct functional states: the **Meteor Form** (the protective shell) and the **Core Form** (the exposed, star-like center). Despite its lack of evolution, it is a highly sought-after Pokémon for collectors due to its varying core colors and its rare Shiny form, which appears as a black core with multi-colored sparkles. It belongs to the **Mineral** egg group and, being genderless, can only be bred with a Ditto. Its biological cycle is tied to the atmosphere; once its shell is broken and it is exposed to the elements for too long, it will eventually vanish into dust if not returned to its protective casing or a Poké Ball.
