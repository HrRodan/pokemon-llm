## Identity & Lore
Mega Gardevoir (Pokedex #10051) is the Embrace Pokémon, a majestic and protective Psychic/Fairy-type that represents the pinnacle of its evolutionary line's emotional bond. Originally discovered in the Hoenn region of Generation III, this specific form is a Mega Evolution, a temporary state of immense power triggered by a Gardevoirite Mega Stone. In this form, its physical appearance shifts to resemble a gown-clad figure, often compared to a white wedding dress, and the red "heart" plate on its chest splits, signifying its heart is now open and its psychokinetic energy is at its peak. Known for its intense loyalty, Gardevoir is said to be able to see into the future and will expend all its power to create a small black hole to protect its Trainer from harm. While it does not possess a Gigantamax or Paradox form, its Mega Evolution remains one of the most iconic transformations in the Pokémon world.

## Evolution & Biology
Mega Gardevoir is the final, temporary stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Ralts**, which evolves into **Kirlia** starting at Level 20. Kirlia then evolves into **Gardevoir** starting at Level 30. While male Kirlia can alternatively evolve into Gallade when exposed to a Dawn Stone, only Gardevoir can achieve this Mega form during battle. Biologically, it is a humanoid Pokémon that thrives in urban habitats and is highly sensitive to the emotions of people and Pokémon. It belongs to the **Humanshape** and **Indeterminate** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20, indicating a relatively long gestation period. Its slow growth rate reflects the disciplined training required to master its vast psychic potential.
