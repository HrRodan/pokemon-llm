## Identity & Lore
Roserade (Pokedex #407) is the elegant Bouquet Pokémon introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Renowned for its deceptive beauty, this dual-type Grass/Poison Pokémon lures prey near with a sweet, intoxicating aroma before striking ruthlessly with thorny whips concealed within its arms. Its appearance resembles a masquerade ball attendee, with a cape-like growth and a mask of leaves. Each of its hands features a different colored flower—one red and one blue—which contain distinct toxins used to weaken or paralyze opponents. While it has no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Roserade is a staple of the Sinnoh region, often associated with the Gym Leader Gardenia and the Champion Cynthia.
