## Identity & Lore
Floatzel (Pokedex #419) is the agile Sea Weasel Pokémon introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**. Distinguishable by its orange-brown fur and the cream-colored flotation sac that encircles its neck like a life preserver, this Pokémon is perfectly adapted for aquatic life. While it possesses sharp fangs and predatory instincts, Floatzel is celebrated in lore for its benevolent behavior; it frequently assists in the rescue of drowning people, inflating its sac to keep victims buoyant while transporting them to safety. It is typically found near rivers and fishing ports, often interacting with humans in coastal communities.

## Evolution & Biology

Its floatation sac is a highly developed organ that allows it to float indefinitely without expending energy.
