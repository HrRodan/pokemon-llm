## Identity & Lore
Kecleon (Pokedex #352) is the Color Swap Pokémon, a unique Normal-type reptile introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Primarily inhabiting forests, this chameleon-like creature is renowned for its ability to manipulate the pigment in its skin to perfectly blend into its surroundings, leaving only the red zigzag pattern on its belly visible. In the lore of the Hoenn region, wild Kecleon often act as invisible obstacles on travel routes, requiring a device like the Devon Scope to be detected. While it usually uses this camouflage to sneak up on prey or hide from predators, Kecleon's skin color will also shift involuntarily based on its mood, darkening when it is sad or brightening when happy.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 90, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 120, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Specially Defensive Utility Tank / Trick Room Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a base Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and **immune to Ghost**. However, its defensive profile is highly fluid due to its type-changing abilities.
*   **Move Selection:** With a respectable Attack stat and low Speed, Kecleon excels with physical priority moves and utility. An optimal set includes **Knock Off** (item disruption), **Drain Punch** (sustain and coverage), **Shadow Sneak** (priority to bypass low speed), and **Recover** (to leverage its high Special Defense). Other notable options include **Sucker Punch** and **Trick Room**.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Color Change:** A reactive ability that changes Kecleon's type to match the type of the move it was last hit by. This can be used to gain resistance to subsequent attacks of the same type.
    *   **Protean (Hidden Ability):** A highly competitive ability that changes Kecleon's type to the type of the move it is about to use *before* execution. This grants it "Same Type Attack Bonus" (STAB) on every move and allows it to defensively predict and resist incoming attacks.

## Evolution & Biology
Kecleon is a standalone species and does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group. In competitive breeding or acquisition, it has a Medium-Slow growth rate and requires approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch. While it has no evolutionary relatives, it shares a unique biological niche with other camouflage-based Pokémon, relying on stealth rather than raw power to survive.
