## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Avalugg (Pokedex #10243) is the Hisuian Form of the Iceberg Pokémon, first discovered in the ancient Hisui region (modern-day Sinnoh). A dual Ice and Rock-type, it is distinguished from its Kalosian counterpart by a massive, armor-like jaw of stone and a body encased in ice as hard as steel. This ancient variant is significantly heavier, weighing 262.4kg, and is known for its cumbersome frame that effortlessly crushes obstacles in its path. In the lore of *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, a notable Hisuian Avalugg serves as the "Lord of the Tundra" in the Alabaster Icelands. While it currently lacks Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, its physical presence is considered one of the most imposing of any quadruped Pokémon in the Monster and Mineral egg groups.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 127, Defense 184, Sp. Atk 34, Sp. Def 36, Speed 38.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Bulky Wallbreaker. With a monumental Defense stat of 184, it is nearly impenetrable by physical strikes, though it is exceptionally vulnerable to special attacks.
* **Type Matchups:** It suffers from two **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Fighting and Steel**. It is also **weak to Rock, Ground, Water, and Grass**. It possesses **resistances to Normal, Flying, Poison, and Ice**.
* **Move Selection:** Hisuian Avalugg leverages its high Attack and signature moves to dominate the physical field. Key moves include **Mountain Gale** (a high-power Ice-type signature move), **Stone Edge** (high-crit Rock STAB), **Crunch** (benefiting from its Strong Jaw ability), and **Recover** (essential for maintaining its massive HP pool). **Ice Shard** is also a vital utility move to bypass its abysmal Speed.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Strong Jaw:** Increases the power of biting moves like Crunch and Ice Fang by 50%.
    * **Ice Body:** Gradually regains HP during Snow or Hail conditions.
    * **Sturdy (Hidden):** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit from full health, a crucial insurance policy given its many weaknesses.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Avalugg is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Bergmite** starting at **Level 37**, specifically when the evolution occurs within the environmental conditions of the Hisui region. Biologically, its body is a fusion of mineral deposits and permafrost; the shield-like ice on its head and the serrated stone of its lower jaw allow it to plow through snowy mountainsides. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Mineral** Egg Groups. Despite its slow movement, its biological design is optimized for pure endurance in sub-zero climates, often found in deep glacial valleys where it can blend into the landscape as a literal iceberg.
