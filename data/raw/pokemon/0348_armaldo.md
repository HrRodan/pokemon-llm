## Identity & Lore
Armaldo (Pokédex #348) is the Plate Pokémon, a dual-type Rock/Bug fossil species introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Resurrected from the **Claw Fossil**, this prehistoric creature represents the evolutionary peak of ancient arthropods that moved from the ocean floor to live on land. Armaldo possesses a grayish carapace of armor so tough that enemy attacks typically bounce off harmlessly. While it is capable of walking upright on two legs to hunt prey on the water's edge, it remains an expert swimmer, diving into oceans to hunt. Its biology features two enormous, extendable claws capable of exerting enough force to punch directly through a steel slab.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 75, Attack 125, Defense 100, Sp. Atk 70, Sp. Def 80, Speed 45.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Rain Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** Due to the unique synergy of Rock and Bug types, Armaldo takes neutral damage from Ground, Fighting, Fire, and Flying moves. It is **weak to Rock, Steel, and Water**. It **resists Normal and Poison** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 125 Attack stat, Armaldo utilizes high-power STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves like **Stone Edge** and **X-Scissor**. To mitigate its low speed or boost its wall-breaking potential, **Swords Dance** is a critical setup move. For coverage, particularly on Rain teams, **Liquidation** or **Earthquake** are optimal choices to handle Rock and Steel-type threats.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Battle Armor:** A defensive ability that prevents the Pokémon from taking critical hits.
    *   **Swift Swim (Hidden):** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during heavy rain, allowing Armaldo to outspeed faster opponents despite its naturally low base Speed.

## Evolution & Biology
Armaldo is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line found in the ancient Hoenn region. It evolves from **Anorith** starting at **Level 40**. Unlike its pre-evolution which is strictly aquatic, Armaldo has adapted to terrestrial life while retaining the ability to swim. It belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group, reflecting its invertebrate, aquatic origins.
