## Identity & Lore
Skeledirge (#911) is the Singer Pokémon, serving as the final evolution of the Fire-type starter line in the Paldea region (Generation IX). This massive, crocodilian Pokémon is distinguished by its vibrant red scales and the presence of a small, fiery bird perched on its snout. According to Paldean lore, this bird was born when a fireball on Skeledirge’s head gained a soul, and it changes shape in response to Skeledirge’s soulful, gravelly singing. Unlike many other starters from previous generations, Skeledirge currently possesses no Mega Evolution, Gigantamax form, or Paradox variant; however, its unique Fire/Ghost typing and specialized signature move make it a standout among Paldean species. It is often found in urban settings or near trainers, as it is a domestic starter, though its biology suggests a preference for warm, terrestrial habitats where its heavy, quadrupedal body can dominate the terrain.

## Evolution & Biology
Skeledirge is part of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins its life as the diminutive **Fuecoco**, which evolves into **Crocalor** starting at Level 16. The transition to its final form, **Skeledirge**, occurs when it reaches Level 36. Biologically, it is a heavy-set quadruped with a weight of 326.5 kg, making it a formidable presence on the battlefield. It belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group, and with a hatch counter of 20, it requires significant effort to breed for competitive stats. Its "Singer" genus is reflected in its movepool, which includes sound-based attacks like Hyper Voice, Sing, and Disarming Voice, all of which resonate through its fiery throat.
