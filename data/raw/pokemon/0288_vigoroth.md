## Identity & Lore
Vigoroth (Pokedex #288) is the Wild Monkey Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Unlike its evolutionary relatives, this Pokémon is defined by an inability to sit still; it possesses a heart that beats at a rapid pace, forcing it to constantly move to relieve stress. If it attempts to stay still, its agitation reaches a boiling point, driving it into a wild rampage through its **Forest** habitat. Its white fur covers a body built for constant upright motion. Uniquely, Vigoroth is the only member of its evolutionary line that does not suffer from lethargy, acting as a hyperactive bridge between two sloth-like stages.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 80, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 55, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Brawler / Eviolite Setup Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Normal-type, it is **weak to Fighting** and possesses an **immunity to Ghost**. It has no natural resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its solid Speed and Attack, combined with unique access to recovery, its ideal kit includes **Body Slam** (for STAB and paralysis utility), **Slack Off** (for reliable healing), **Bulk Up** (to boost its offensive and defensive stats), and **Play Rough** or **Earthquake** (for coverage against Fighting or Rock/Steel types).
*   **Abilities:** **Vital Spirit** (Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep). This ability is tactically significant as it grants immunity to sleep-inducing moves like Spore or Hypnosis, reflecting its restless nature.

## Evolution & Biology
Vigoroth is the second stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Slakoth** starting at **Level 18** and evolves into **Slaking** starting at **Level 36**. Notably, Vigoroth loses the hindering Truant ability possessed by both its pre-evolution and evolution, making it uniquely consistent in combat compared to its family members. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group.
