## Identity & Lore
Florges (Pokedex #671) is the Garden Pokémon, a majestic pure Fairy-type originally discovered in the Kalos region (Generation VI). Standing 1.1 meters tall, Florges is famous for its symbiotic relationship with nature, claiming exquisite flower gardens as its territory and drawing immense power from the energy emitted by flowering plants. While its base color is white, Florges manifests in five distinct color variants—Red, Yellow, Orange, Blue, and White—determined by the specific flower its pre-evolution, Flabébé, chose at birth. Although it is frequently mistaken for a Grass-type due to its ornate floral crown and plant-based abilities, it remains a pure Fairy-type. In the history of the Kalos region, its evolutionary line is deeply tied to the lore of the Eternal Flower and the king AZ. While Florges does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its incredible Special Defense makes it one of the most resilient non-legendary Fairy-types in existence.

## Evolution & Biology
Florges is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. The cycle begins with **Flabébé**, which evolves into **Floette** starting at Level 19. The transformation into Florges is unique and does not occur through natural growth; it only evolves when Floette is **exposed to a Shiny Stone**. Biologically, Florges is a female-only species and belongs to the **Fairy Egg Group**, with a hatch counter of approximately 20 cycles. It is known to live for hundreds of years, dedicated entirely to the protection of the gardens it inhabits. Despite its lack of Grass-typing, its biology allows it to master moves like Petal Blizzard, Solar Beam, and Aromatherapy, making it an essential guardian for floral ecosystems.
