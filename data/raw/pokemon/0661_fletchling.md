## Identity & Lore
Fletchling (Pokedex #661) is the Tiny Robin Pokémon, a small avian species first discovered in the Kalos region during Generation VI. This red-headed Pokémon is widely recognized for its friendly nature and its habit of sending signals to its peers through beautiful chirps and specific tail-feather movements. Despite its diminutive size and "Tiny Robin" classification, it is known to be surprisingly aggressive in battle once provoked. While Fletchling does not possess a Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox form itself, its final evolution, Talonflame, is legendary in the competitive circuit for its high speed and signature ability. In the wild of Kalos and later regions like Paldea, Fletchling is a common sight in forests and meadows, often serving as a trainer's first introduction to the Flying type.

## Evolution & Biology
Fletchling is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Fletchinder** starting at Level 17, at which point it sheds its Normal typing to become Fire/Flying. Fletchinder further evolves into the apex predator **Talonflame** at Level 35. Fletchling belongs to the **Flying** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15. Its biological development is marked by a "Medium-Slow" growth rate, reflecting the significant power spike it receives upon reaching its final, fiery form. Its anatomy is specifically adapted for high-speed maneuvers, represented by its "wings" shape classification.
