## Identity & Lore
Throh (Pokedex #538) is the Judo Pokémon, a burly Fighting-type introduced in Generation V (Unova). This red-skinned, humanoid Pokémon is easily identified by its robust physique and its distinctive white gi-like garment cinched by a black belt. According to lore, Throh weaves these belts from vines found in the wild; as it tightens the belt, its spirit and physical power surge significantly. A master of grappling, it is known to instinctively travel in groups of five, often seen as the more durable, power-focused counterpart to the agile Sawk. While Throh does not possess a Mega Evolution, Z-Move exclusive, or Gigantamax form, its sheer physical presence and mastery of judo techniques make it a formidable wrestler in the Unova region and beyond.

## Combat Profile

* **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Tank. With a massive HP pool and solid mixed defenses, Throh excels at absorbing hits and retaliating with high-impact throws.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy**. It **resists Bug, Rock, and Dark** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high Attack and low Speed, Throh relies on techniques that manipulate the opponent or capitalize on its strength. Key moves include **Storm Throw** (a signature move that always results in a critical hit), **Circle Throw** (forcing the opponent to switch out), **Knock Off** (to remove held items), and **Earthquake** (for wide physical coverage against Poison, Steel, and Electric types). 
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Guts:** Increases the Attack stat by 50% if afflicted by a status condition; notably, the Attack drop from Burn is ignored.
    * **Inner Focus:** Prevents the Pokémon from flinching and protects it from the stat-lowering effects of the Intimidate ability.
    * **Mold Breaker (Hidden):** Allows Throh to use its moves regardless of the target's defensive abilities (e.g., hitting through Sturdy or Levitate).

## Evolution & Biology
Throh is a single-stage Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. It is part of an all-male species, which correlates with its counterpart Sawk. Biologically, it is extremely heavy for its size (55.5 kg), giving it the low center of gravity necessary for its signature throwing maneuvers. It belongs to the **Humanshape** Egg Group, reflecting its anthropomorphic features. Field reports suggest that Throh can be found holding a **Black Belt** or **Expert Belt**, items that further enhance its prowess in martial combat. With a hatch counter of 20, breeders find it requires a standard amount of care to raise from an egg.
