## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Electrode (Pokedex #101 / #10232) is the Ball Pokémon, a unique regional variant discovered in the ancient Hisui region (Generation VIII), which eventually became modern-day Sinnoh. While its Kantonian relative is known for its metallic surface and resemblance to modern Poké Balls, Hisuian Electrode possesses a wood-like grain and a hole in its head through which it releases electricity. It is an Electric and Grass-type Pokémon that stores an immense amount of electrical energy under high pressure within its body. This volatile state makes it prone to exploding with little to no provocation, often to the distress of nearby travelers or Pokémon. Unlike many other species, Hisuian Electrode does not currently possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, but it stands out as one of the fastest non-legendary creatures ever documented.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 50, Defense 70, Sp. Atk 80, Sp. Def 80, Speed 150.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Pivot / Speed Tier King. Its massive Speed stat allows it to outpace nearly the entire unboosted metagame.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Poison, Bug, Fire, and Ice**. Thanks to its Grass typing, it neutralizes the standard Electric weakness to Ground. It **resists Steel, Grass, and Water**, while providing a 4x resistance to Electric attacks.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its superior Speed and special offensive capabilities, its most effective tools include **Chloroblast** (its signature high-recoil Grass move), **Thunderbolt** for consistent Electric damage, **Leaf Storm** for immediate burst power, and **Volt Switch** to maintain competitive momentum.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Soundproof:** Provides immunity to sound-based moves such as Roar, Bug Buzz, and Boomburst.
    * **Static:** May paralyze opponents that make direct physical contact with its wooden body.
    * **Aftermath (Hidden):** Damages the attacker if Hisuian Electrode is fainted by a contact move, serving as a final act of spite.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Electrode is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Hisuian Voltorb** when exposed to a **Leaf Stone**, a departure from the traditional level-up requirement of its Kantonian counterpart. Biologically, it is categorized within the **Mineral** egg group. Despite its plant-like traits and wooden texture, it retains the spherical, mimicry-based biology of the Voltorb family, blending into environments where ancient wooden Poké Balls were once common. Its high hatch counter of 20 indicates it requires significant care to bring to term from an egg.
