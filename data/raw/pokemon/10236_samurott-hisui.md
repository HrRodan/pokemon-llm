## Identity & Lore
Hisuian Samurott (Pokedex #10236) is the Formidable Pokémon, a regional variant discovered in the ancient Hisui region (the land that would become modern-day Sinnoh). Unlike its Unovian counterpart, Hisuian Samurott is a Water and Dark-type, reflecting a shift from a disciplined warrior to a cold, calculating combatant that favors "dirty" tactics to ensure victory. Its appearance is characterized by dark, jagged armor shells and a wicked, curved blade known as a seamitar. While it originates from the Generation V starter Oshawott, this specific form was introduced during the events of Generation VIII. Although it currently lacks a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Hisuian Samurott’s unique biological adaptation allows it to stand as a fierce rival to other regional powerhouses like Decidueye and Typhlosion. It is known for its chilling glare, which can silence a crowd instantly, and its ability to fell opponents with a single, ruthless swing of its sword-like armor.

## Evolution & Biology
Hisuian Samurott is the final stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It begins as **Oshawott**, which evolves into **Dewott** starting at Level 17. In the Hisui region, Dewott evolves into **Hisuian Samurott** starting at Level 36. This transformation is influenced by the unique environment and spiritual energy of ancient Sinnoh, diverging from the standard Unovian Samurott. Biologically, it is a quadrupedal mammalian Pokémon that belongs to the **Ground** egg group. It has a hatch counter of 20, and its growth rate is classified as medium-slow. Despite its bulky appearance, it is a master of swift, deceptive movements, often striking before an opponent can react to its presence.
