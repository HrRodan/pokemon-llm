## Identity & Lore
Roaming Form Gimmighoul (#10263) is the small, agile variant of the Coin Chest Pokémon, originally discovered in the Paldea region during Generation IX. Unlike its stationary counterpart that hides within stout wooden chests, the Roaming Form is characterized by its diminutive, thin body and its tendency to wander the landscape while carrying a single, precious Gimmighoul Coin on its back. Lore suggests this species was born inside a treasure chest nearly 1,500 years ago; while the chest-bound version leeches life-force from those who attempt to steal its gold, the Roaming Form is much more elusive, often disappearing the moment a human approaches. Though it lacks the defensive utility of a chest, it is noted for its surprising speed and persistence. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolution, Gholdengo, is considered one of the most competitively significant "Golden" entities in the Pokémon world.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 30, Defense 25, Sp. Atk 75, Sp. Def 45, Speed 80.
* **Archetype:** Fast Special Attacker. Its low defensive profile makes it a "Glass Cannon" in lower-tier play, relying on its decent base speed to act before taking a hit.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Ghost-type**, it is **weak to Ghost and Dark**. It possesses crucial **immunities to Normal and Fighting** moves and **resists Poison and Bug** types.
* **Move Selection:** Prioritizing its superior Special Attack and Speed, Gimmighoul-Roaming benefits from high-impact spectral and coverage moves:
    * **Shadow Ball:** A reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move that can lower the target's Special Defense.
    * **Power Gem:** Vital Rock-type coverage to hit Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug types that might otherwise threaten it.
    * **Nasty Plot:** A setup move that sharply raises Special Attack, allowing it to become a legitimate sweeping threat.
    * **Hex:** Pairs excellently with status-inflicting teammates to double its base power against afflicted foes.
* **Abilities:** **Run Away** (Enables a sure getaway from wild Pokémon battles, reflecting its timid and elusive nature in the Paldean wilds).

## Evolution & Biology
Gimmighoul-Roaming is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. Its biological progression is unique among all species: it evolves into **Gholdengo** only after the trainer has collected **999 Gimmighoul Coins** and levels the Pokémon up. These coins are gathered by interacting with Roaming Form Gimmighoul scattered across the world or defeating the Chest Form in battle. Biologically, the Roaming Form is extremely lightweight (1.0 kg) and small (0.1 m), allowing it to hide behind signs, rocks, and ruins. It belongs to the **No-eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group, meaning it cannot be bred in captivity, and its growth rate is notably slow, requiring significant experience to reach its full potential.
