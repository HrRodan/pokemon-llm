## Identity & Lore
Luxray (Pokedex #405) is the Gleam Eyes Pokémon, a distinct electric-type predator introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh). Visually resembling a mature lion or lynx, this blue quadrupedal Pokémon is renowned for its golden eyes, which possess x-ray capabilities, allowing it to see through solid objects to spot prey or detect danger behind walls. In the wild, Luxray uses this ability to track targets while remaining completely hidden. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is a fan-favorite Sinnoh native often associated with the Sunyshore City Gym Leader, Volkner.
