## Identity & Lore
Nincada (Pokedex #290) is the Trainee Pokémon introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). A dual-type Bug/Ground creature, it draws inspiration from the nymph stage of a cicada. Nincada spends nearly its entire life underground in complete darkness, using its sharp claws to carve out the roots of trees to absorb nutrients and moisture. Its gray, armor-like shell protects it while it remains nearly motionless, patiently waiting for the moment it is ready to evolve. While Nincada itself does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is famous for possessing the most unique evolutionary split in the Pokémon world, birthing two separate Pokémon simultaneously under specific conditions.

## Evolution & Biology
Nincada belongs to a unique evolutionary line that creates a divergence based on the trainer's party status. It evolves into **Ninjask** starting at **Level 20**. However, if the trainer has an extra open slot in their party and an unused Poké Ball in their bag at the time of evolution, a **Shedinja** will mysteriously appear in the empty slot, formed from Nincada's shed shell. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles.
