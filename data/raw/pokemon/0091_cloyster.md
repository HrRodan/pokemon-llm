## Identity & Lore
Cloyster (Pokedex #091) is the Bivalve Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Ice creature indigenous to the Kanto region (Generation I). Distinguished by its rock-hard, purple shell, Cloyster inhabits the sea, where it relies on its nearly impenetrable defense for survival. Lore suggests its shell is harder than diamond and can withstand bomb explosions; consequently, no one has ever seen its innards. Defensive by nature, it shifts to an offensive stance when attacked, launching its spikes in quick, successive volleys. While it lacks Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is recognized for its extreme physical durability.
