## Identity & Lore
Sinistcha (Pokedex #1013) is the Matcha Pokémon, a dual-type Grass/Ghost creature first discovered in the land of Kitakami within Generation IX. While it bears a striking resemblance to the Galar region's Polteageist, it is actually a **convergent species**, evolving from Poltchageist rather than being a regional variant. Its body consists of a haunted tea canister filled with matcha; it attempts to blend into tea ceremonies to drain the life-force of unsuspecting drinkers, though its disguise is frequently seen through. Sinistcha exists in two distinct forms based on the authenticity of its pottery: the **Unremarkable Form** and the **Masterpiece Form**, the latter of which is distinguished by a seal of authenticity on the bottom of its canister.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 71, Attack 60, Defense 106, Sp. Atk 121, Sp. Def 80, Speed 70.
* **Archetype:** Bulky Special Sweeper / Support Tank.
* **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Flying, Poison, Bug, Fire, Ice, Ghost, and Dark**. It **resists Ground, Water, Grass, and Electric**, and possesses total **immunities to Normal and Fighting** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Leveraging its elite Special Attack and signature capabilities, Sinistcha excels with **Matcha Gotcha** (a signature Grass move that heals the user), **Shadow Ball** for Ghost-type STAB, **Strength Sap** to neutralize physical attackers while recovering health, and **Nasty Plot** to boost its offensive pressure.
* **Abilities:** 
    * **Hospitality:** Upon entering battle, the Pokémon restores a small amount of its ally's HP—an exceptional tool for VGC and Double Battles.
    * **Heatproof (Hidden):** Effectively halves the damage taken from Fire-type moves and prevents burn damage, significantly mitigating one of its primary elemental weaknesses.

## Evolution & Biology
Sinistcha is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Poltchageist** when exposed to a specific item: the **Unremarkable Teacup** (for Counterfeit Form Poltchageist) or the **Masterpiece Teacup** (for Artisan Form Poltchageist). As a spirit inhabiting a tea vessel, it belongs to the **Mineral** and **Indeterminate (Amorphous)** Egg Groups. Biologically, it is highly territorial over its "tea," often stirring its whisk-like head to generate spiritual energy. Despite its ghostly nature, its physical form is remarkably sturdy due to its ceramic housing, reflected in its high base Defense.
