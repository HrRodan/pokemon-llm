## Identity & Lore
Goldeen (Pokedex #118) is the Goldfish Pokémon, a pure Water-type entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its elegant, red and white scales, this Pokémon is famous for its long, flowing tail fin which billows underwater like a ballroom dress. This distinctive appearance has earned it the nickname "The Water Queen" among enthusiasts. Goldeen prefers the calm habitats found at the water's edge, where it can swim gracefully. While it appears beautiful, it is tempered by a wild nature; it will retaliate fiercely with its horn if its tail is touched.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 45, Attack 67, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 50, Speed 63.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric**. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its significantly higher Attack stat (67) compared to Special Attack (35), Goldeen's optimal moveset avoids special attacks like Hydro Pump. Key moves include:
    *   **Waterfall:** Reliable physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) with a chance to flinch.
    *   **Megahorn:** A high-power Bug-type move for coverage against Grass types.
    *   **Drill Run:** Ground-type coverage that specifically counters Electric-type threats.
    *   **Knock Off:** Utility damage that removes the opponent's held item.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during rain, making it a viable sweeper in weather teams.
    *   **Water Veil:** Prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn, protecting its physical Attack stat from being halved.
    *   **Lightning Rod (Hidden):** Draws in all Electric-type moves to itself to raise Special Attack and grants immunity to Electric damage. While the Special Attack boost is less useful for Goldeen, the Electric immunity is tactically excellent.

## Evolution & Biology
Goldeen is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Seaking** starting at **Level 33**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20. In the wild, Goldeen may occasionally be found holding a **Mystic Water**, which boosts the power of its Water-type moves.
