## Identity & Lore
Charizard (Pokedex #006) is the iconic Flame Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). A powerful, draconic creature with orange scales and large wings, it seeks out strong opponents and breathes fire of such intense heat that it can melt boulders. While generally noble, it is known to unintentionally cause forest fires with its breath. Charizard inhabits rugged mountains and valleys. Though it resembles a dragon, its base form is strictly Fire/Flying; however, it possesses immense latent potential, capable of undergoing Mega Evolution into two distinct forms—**Mega Charizard X** (gaining the Dragon type) and **Mega Charizard Y** (summoning sunlight)—as well as achieving a colossal **Gigantamax** form in the Galar region.

*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sweeper / Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual Fire/Flying type, Charizard possesses a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock** attacks (such as Stealth Rock). It is also weak to Water and Electric moves. Conversely, it is immune to Ground moves and boasts a **Double Resistance (4x) to Grass and Bug**, while also resisting Steel, Fire, Fairy, and Fighting types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its superior Special Attack (109) and Speed (100), an optimal move set includes **Fire Blast** or **Flamethrower** for reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Air Slash** (or Hurricane) for Flying coverage, **Solar Beam** to counter Water and Rock types (ideally used in harsh sunlight), and **Roost** or **Focus Blast** for utility and coverage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Blaze:** Powers up Fire-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Solar Power (Hidden Ability):** Boosts Special Attack by 1.5x during strong sunlight but drains HP at the end of each turn, making it a premier threat on Sun teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Charizard is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Charmeleon** starting at **Level 36**, which is the evolved form of **Charmander** (acquired at Level 16). It belongs to the **Monster** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
