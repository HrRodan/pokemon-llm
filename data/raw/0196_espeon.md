## Identity & Lore
Espeon (Pokedex #196) is the Psychic-type **Sun Pokémon** introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Characterized by its sleek, purple fur and the red gem embedded in its forehead, this quadrupedal creature is one of the distinct evolutions of Eevee, often referred to as an "Eeveelution." Lore states that Espeon utilizes the fine, velvety hair covering its body to sense minute shifts in air currents, allowing it to predict an opponent's next move and even the weather. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is highly regarded for its psychic proficiency and loyalty to its trainer. It is typically found in urban settings or basking in sunlight to recharge its psychic energy.
