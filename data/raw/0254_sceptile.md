## Identity & Lore
Sceptile (Pokedex #254) is the Forest Pokémon, a nimble reptilian creature first introduced in Generation III (Hoenn). Distinguished by the razor-sharp leaves growing on its arms and the yellow seeds on its back, Sceptile is famed for its incredible agility within its natural forest habitat. It moves with such speed that it can leap freely between tree branches, often ambushing foes from above or behind. While primarily a Grass-type, Sceptile possesses a latent draconian heritage, which manifests fully when it undergoes **Mega Evolution** into Mega Sceptile, gaining the Dragon type and the Lightning Rod ability.
