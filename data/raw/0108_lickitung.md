## Identity & Lore
Lickitung (Pokedex #108) is the Licking Pokémon, a Normal-type creature originally discovered in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Characterized by its soft, pink skin and upright posture, this Pokémon is predominantly found in **grassland** habitats. Its most defining biological feature is its prehensile tongue, which measures over twice the length of its body. Lickitung utilizes this tongue much like a chameleon to capture prey and explore its surroundings. Its saliva is sticky and capable of causing a tingling sensation or rashes on those it licks. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it serves as the base form for the formidable Lickilicky.
