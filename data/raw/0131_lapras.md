## Identity & Lore
Lapras (Pokedex #131) is the Transport Pokémon, a gentle and intelligent Water/Ice-type creature originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Residing primarily in the **sea**, this blue, plesiosaur-like Pokémon is renowned for its ability to understand human speech and its willingness to ferry people across bodies of water on its back. Historically, Lapras was overhunted almost to the point of extinction due to its docile nature, though recent reports suggest populations are recovering. While it generally does not evolve, in the Galar region, it is capable of achieving a special **Gigantamax** form, where its shell develops a musical ring resembling a choir.
