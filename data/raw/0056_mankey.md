## Identity & Lore
Mankey (Pokedex #056) is the Pig Monkey Pokémon introduced in **Generation I (Kanto)**. This Fighting-type creature is characterized by its spherical, furry body, pig-like nose, and nimble limbs. Renowned for its volatile temperament, Mankey resides primarily in **mountainous habitats** where it lives in colonies. Its anger threshold is remarkably low; it can transition from docile to a thrashing rage in an instant, often without provocation. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the first stage of a prestigious lineage that culminates in the Paldean-native Annihilape.

## Combat Profile

*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure **Fighting-type**, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy** attacks. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and decent Speed, key moves include **Close Combat** (high-power STAB), **U-turn** (for pivoting momentum), **Gunk Shot** (coverage against Fairy-types), and **Ice Punch** (coverage against Flying-types).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Vital Spirit:** Prevents the Pokémon from falling asleep.
    *   **Anger Point:** Maxes out the Attack stat if the Pokémon takes a critical hit.
    *   **Defiant (Hidden):** Sharply boosts the Attack stat when a stat is lowered by an opponent, making it an excellent counter to Intimidate users.

## Evolution & Biology
Mankey is the first stage of a notable **three-stage evolutionary line**. It evolves into **Primeape** upon reaching **Level 28**. In later generations (specifically Generation IX), Primeape can further evolve into the Ghost/Fighting-type **Annihilape** after using the move **Rage Fist** 20 times. Mankey belongs to the **Field (Ground)** Egg Group.
