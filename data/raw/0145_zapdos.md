## Identity & Lore
Zapdos (Pokedex #145) is the Legendary **Electric Pokémon** introduced in Generation I (**Kanto**). As one of the three **Legendary Birds** (alongside Articuno and Moltres), this avian entity is revered for its control over electricity. Lore states that Zapdos lives inside thunderclouds and is capable of manipulating lightning; it is said to appear from the clouds while dropping enormous lightning bolts, causing crackling sounds and snapping noises as it flies. Visually, it possesses jagged, yellow plumage resembling lightning bolts. While the Kanto variant is Electric/Flying, a regional variant known as **Galarian Zapdos** exists, which adopts a Fighting/Flying typing and distinct terrestrial behavior.
