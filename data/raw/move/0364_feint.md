## Identity & Mechanics
**Feint** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user deceptively telegraphs a different strike before delivering a lightning-fast blow that catches the opponent off guard. This move is specifically designed to punish defensive positioning, piercing through magical and physical barriers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and successfully hits even if the target is using protective moves like **Protect**, **Detect**, **Spiky Shield**, **Baneful Bunker**, **King’s Shield**, or **Obstruct**. Upon hit, it immediately nullifies the protection effect for the remainder of the turn, allowing the user's allies to land their attacks.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but it possesses a high **Priority of +2**, allowing it to outspeed most standard priority moves like Quick Attack or Sucker Punch.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Anti-Defense Utility / Priority Finisher.
* **Usage:** While its base power is extremely low, Feint is a premier technical choice in **Doubles and VGC** formats. Its ability to "break" a Protect allows a partner Pokémon to land a powerful "nuke" on a target that thought it was safe. In Singles, it serves as a niche finisher to bypass priority-bracket competition due to its +2 speed. It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static. It cannot be copied by Mirror Move or called by Metronome.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (102 learners), primarily found among nimble fighters and cunning predators.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Lucario**, **Scizor**, and **Pikachu**. Its presence on **Mega Pinsir** (via Aerialate) once turned it into a niche priority Flying-type move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Fighting and Bug-type Pokémon like **Breloom**, **Heracross**, and **Lokix** to provide indispensable utility in breaking through stall-heavy tactics or finishing off Focus Sash users.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through **level-up** or **Egg Moves**; it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its presence on a moveset a deliberate teambuilding choice rather than a filler move.
