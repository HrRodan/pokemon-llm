## Identity & Mechanics
**Magnet Bomb** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user harnesses electromagnetic forces to launch a specialized metallic projectile that adheres to the target. By utilizing magnetic homing, the bomb bypasses defensive maneuvers, ensuring the attack connects even in low-visibility conditions or against highly elusive opponents.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and is guaranteed to hit, ignoring all accuracy and evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy ∞%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reliability Option / Evasion Counter.
* **Usage:** Magnet Bomb serves as a niche "never-miss" move, similar to *Swift* or *Aerial Ace*. In competitive play, its low base power (60) usually makes it inferior to **Iron Head** (80 Power + Flinch chance) or **Heavy Slam**. However, it provides a hard counter to "Evasion Cheese" strategies (e.g., Double Team or Minimize users). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **ball/bomb move**, meaning it is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof** (e.g., Chesnaught). Despite being a "bomb," it is a Physical contact-free attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **narrow** distribution, learned by only **5** Pokémon across the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily associated with the **Magnezone** evolutionary line and **Probopass**, who utilize their magnetic bodies to fire the projectiles. 
* **Coverage Utility:** The Mythical Pokémon **Genesect** is the most notable competitive user; while Genesect often prefers Special attacks, Magnet Bomb provides a perfectly accurate Physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for Shift Gear or Choice Band sets.
* **Acquisition:** Magnet Bomb is notably rare as it is **not available via TM or TR** in any generation, restricted almost entirely to the level-up movepools of inorganic Steel-type Pokémon.
