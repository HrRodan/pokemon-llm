## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Flare** is a Physical (or Special) Fire-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII**.
* **Description:** Exclusive to the Dynamax phenomenon of the Galar region, the user manifests its inner heat into a colossal, exploding pillar of solar energy. This move scours the battlefield, intensifying the atmospheric temperature to create a prolonged period of blistering heat.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage on a single target and immediately summons **Harsh Sunlight** (Sun) to the battlefield for five turns (eight if the user holds a Heat Rock).
* **Secondary Effect:** The resulting Sun weather increases the power of Fire-type moves by 50% and decreases the power of Water-type moves by 50% for its duration.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power Varies (100–150 based on the base move), Accuracy [—]% (Bypasses Accuracy), PP 10.
* **Role:** **Offensive Weather Setter / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Max Flare is a central pillar of Generation VIII competitive play (VGC and BSS). Unlike the status move *Sunny Day*, Max Flare allows a Pokémon to maintain offensive pressure while setting the weather. It is frequently used to overwrite an opponent's Rain or Sandstorm to disrupt their strategy. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy and evasion checks. If used against a target using *Protect* or *Detect*, it still deals 25% of its total damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among any Pokémon capable of using a damaging Fire-type move while Dynamaxed.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Cinderace:** Often uses its signature *Pyro Ball* as a base to launch a 140-Power Max Flare, benefitting from *Libero* STAB.
    * **Charizard:** Highly synergistic with its *Solar Power* ability, as Max Flare sets the Sun required to trigger a massive Special Attack boost.
    * **Groudon:** In restricted formats, it uses Max Flare to maintain its weather advantage against Primal-like threats or Kyogre.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Fire Pokémon like **Dragapult** (via *Fire Blast*) or **Garchomp** (via *Fire Fang*) to lure in and incinerate **Steel-type** walls like Ferrothorn or Corviknight.
* **Acquisition:** Automatically becomes available to any Pokémon with an equipped Fire-type attacking move upon Dynamaxing.
