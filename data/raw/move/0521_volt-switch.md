## Identity & Mechanics
**Volt Switch** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user discharges a burst of high-voltage electricity at the target to create a distraction, immediately rushing back to its Poké Ball to switch places with a teammate. This tactical maneuver allows the trainer to deal damage while simultaneously seizing momentum.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage, then the user switches out of battle. The trainer then chooses a replacement from the party. The switch-out effect will not trigger if the move is negated (e.g., hitting a Ground-type, a Pokémon with Volt Absorb, or if the target protects). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Effect chance: N/A).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Pivot Move** / **Momentum Generator**.
* **Usage:** Volt Switch is a cornerstone of competitive play, functioning as the Electric-type equivalent to *U-turn* and *Flip Turn*. It is used to "chip" away at the opponent's HP while pivoting into a counter. A "Slow Volt Switch" (using the move with a low-Speed Pokémon) is a common strategy to allow a fragile sweeper to enter the field safely without taking damage. Unlike *U-turn*, Volt Switch can be completely blocked by **Ground-types**, which prevents the user from switching out.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based Special attack. It bypasses and ends the effects of *Ingrain*.

It has a very wide distribution (112 learners), making it one of the most common utility moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Rotom (all forms)**, **Zapdos**, **Tapu Koko**, and **Magnezone**. In modern formats, the legendary **Miraidon** and the Paradox Pokémon **Regieleki** utilize it for high-speed scouting.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-pure Electric types like **Magearna** (Steel/Fairy), **Iron Treads** (Ground/Steel), and **Forretress** (Bug/Steel) to provide those bulky Pokémon with a way to escape unfavorable matchups while maintaining pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (TM72 in many gens, TM048 in Gen 9) across almost every generation since its debut.
