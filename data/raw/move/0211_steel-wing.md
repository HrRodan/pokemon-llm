## Identity & Mechanics
**Steel Wing** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user spreads its wings and stiffens them like tempered steel before slamming into the target with a powerful slicing or bludgeoning motion. This metallic coating not only reinforces the attack but can occasionally bolster the user's own physical resilience.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to raise the user’s Defense stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 90%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Mid-tier Coverage / Utility.
* **Usage:** Steel Wing primarily serves as a vital **Coverage** option for Flying-types to answer their natural weaknesses. While its 90% accuracy makes it slightly unreliable compared to 100% accuracy moves, and its 70 Power is outperformed by **Iron Head** (80 BP), it is often the only Steel-type physical move available to bird-like Pokémon. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (118 learners), almost exclusively consisting of Pokémon with wings (Birds, Dragons, and Insects).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) users include **Skarmory**, **Corviknight**, and **Scizor**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Steel Flying-types and Dragons such as **Dragonite**, **Salamence**, and **Aerodactyl** specifically to lure and hit **Fairy-type** checks like Clefable or Sylveon.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has been available as a **TM** (TM47 in older gens, TM51 in others) or **TR** in nearly every generation since its debut.
