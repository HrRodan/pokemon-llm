## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Darkness** is a Dark-type Max Move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** A powerful Dark-type attack used by Dynamaxed Pokémon. The user gathers overwhelming shadows and malevolent energy, erupting it beneath the target to crush their defenses. This move transforms from any offensive Dark-type move known by the Pokémon upon Dynamaxing.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and lowers the target's **Special Defense** stat by one stage. It bypasses accuracy checks and hits through protection moves (dealing 25% of its original damage). 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target's **Special Defense** by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales: 100–150 based on base move], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Wallbreaker / Special Defense Crusher.
* **Usage:** While the JSON lists this instance as Physical, Max Darkness scales its damage class based on the base move (Physical base moves become Physical Max Darkness; Special base moves become Special Max Darkness). Its primary competitive value lies in its **secondary effect**—lowering Special Defense. This makes it a devastating tool for **Special Attackers** like Hydreigon or Yveltal, as each hit makes the next one even more powerful. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Dynamax Mechanic, Bypasses Accuracy, Stat-Lowering.
