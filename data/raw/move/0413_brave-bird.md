## Identity & Mechanics
**Brave Bird** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user tucks in its wings and dives from a great height, charging the target at terminal velocity. This high-impact aerial assault generates massive kinetic force, resulting in a devastating collision that damages both the target and the attacker. It is the premier high-power Physical Flying-type move, characterized by its "high-risk, high-reward" nature.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive regular damage. The user sustains recoil damage equal to 1/3 (33.3%) of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Recoil only).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Brave Bird is the gold standard for Physical Flying-type offense. It is preferred over **Drill Peck** due to its significantly higher base power, despite the recoil penalty. In competitive play, it is often paired with the **Reckless** ability (which boosts recoil moves) or **Gale Wings** (which provides priority). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Grass, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among avian and winged Pokémon (74 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to "regional birds" and powerful fliers including **Staraptor** (utilizing the Reckless ability for extreme damage), **Talonflame** (historically dominant with Gale Wings priority), and **Corviknight** (using it as a reliable, high-damage STAB option on defensive sets). 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-traditional fliers such as **Blaziken** and **Sirfetch'd** to provide vital coverage against Fighting-type mirrors and Grass-type walls. It is also utilized by Legendaries like **Ho-Oh** and **Galarian Zapdos**.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** or **TR** (Technical Record) in Sword/Shield, Scarlet/Violet, and other recent iterations, making it easy to teach to physical attackers with wings.
