## Identity & Mechanics
**Copycat** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user mimics and executes the move used immediately before it by any Pokémon on the field. This versatile imitation technique allows the user to turn an opponent's strategy against them or chain its own moves. It is a reactive, tactical tool that relies on turn-order sequencing and prediction to succeed.
* **Effect:** Executes the last successfully used move. It cannot copy itself, moves that force switching (like Roar or Whirlwind), or specific "Call Moves" (like Metronome or Assist). If no move has been used yet in the battle, Copycat will fail.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Inherits the effects of the copied move).
* **Targeting:** User (Self-targeting to initiate the call).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Wildcard.
* **Usage:** Copycat is a high-skill ceiling move used primarily for **niche disruption** or **priority-based combos**. In competitive play, its most famous application involves the ability **Prankster** (notably on Riolu), allowing the user to copy a high-power move or a field effect like **Trick Room** with increased priority. It serves as a check to opponents who rely on predictable high-damage nukes or hazards. Unlike *Mirror Move*, which only copies the target's move, Copycat can copy a teammate's move in Doubles, enabling powerful "double-casting" strategies.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type status move, it deals no direct damage, but the resulting move inherits its own type effectiveness.
* **Attributes:** This is classified as a **Call Move**. It ignores *Substitute* if the copied move does. It cannot be used by *Sleep Talk* or *Metronome*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (65 learners), primarily found among Pokémon known for mimicry, playfulness, or high intelligence.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Lucario** (and Riolu), **Mimikyu**, and **Maushold**. It is a signature-style move for the **Eevee** evolutionary line (Sylveon, Umbreon, etc.) and the **Clefairy** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Sudowoodo** or **Mr. Rime** to mirror high-damage STAB moves from opponents that they would otherwise lack the coverage to hit effectively. In lower tiers, **Riolu** is a notorious user due to the Prankster + Copycat + Roar/Phazing interaction (in older generations) or Priority Trick Room.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up or as an **Egg Move**. It is generally not available as a TM/TR, making its distribution more exclusive to specific evolutionary families.
