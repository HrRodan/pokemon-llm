## Identity & Mechanics
**Rolling Kick** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user executes a swift, spinning kick, utilizing centrifugal force to strike the opponent. The momentum of the rotation is designed to catch the target off-balance, often leaving them staggered and unable to retaliate.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30%** chance to make the target **flinch**, preventing their move for the turn if the user moves first.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 85%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Niche Flinch Utility.
* **Usage:** Rolling Kick is largely considered a sub-optimal choice in competitive formats. Its **low accuracy (85%)** is a significant liability for a move with only **60 Base Power**, especially when compared to more reliable Fighting-type options like *Brick Break* (75 Power, 100% Accuracy) or *Low Sweep*. It is primarily utilized in "In-Game" playthroughs during the early-to-mid levels before more powerful moves like *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick* are learned. 
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like *Rough Skin* or *Iron Barbs* and items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (5 total learners), making it one of the rarer Fighting-type moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with the "Hitmons," it is most notably used by **Hitmonlee** and **Hitmontop**. It is also part of the natural level-up set for the **Machop** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** The Mythical Pokémon **Marshadow** and the baby Pokémon **Elekid** are among the few non-standard Fighting-type learners, though Marshadow almost always opts for its signature *Spectral Thief* or higher-tier Fighting moves.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is restricted almost entirely to level-up learnsets; it has **never been a TM or TR**, further limiting its presence in the competitive meta.
