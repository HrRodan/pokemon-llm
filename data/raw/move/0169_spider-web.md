## Identity & Mechanics
**Spider Web** is a status Bug-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user spins and casts a sticky, intricate web of silk around the target, physically anchoring them to the battlefield. This specialized Bug-type technique prevents the opponent from fleeing wild encounters or switching out to a teammate during a trainer battle. It is a signature "Trapping" move designed to isolate and eliminate high-value targets.
* **Effect:** Prevents the target from switching out or fleeing. Unlike many status moves, it ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring the trap is set. The effect ends if the user leaves the field, though the trap can be transferred via Baton Pass. The target can only escape using specific pivoting moves like U-turn, Volt Switch, Flip Turn, or by holding a Shed Shell.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to trap).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Trapping Utility / Setup Enabler.
* **Usage:** Spider Web is functionally identical to *Mean Look* and *Block*. Its primary competitive niche is "Trap-and-Kill" or "Trap-and-Setup" strategies. By preventing a switch, the user can force a favorable matchup, set up entry hazards (like Sticky Web), or prepare a "Perish Trap" combo (though the current learners lack Perish Song). It is specifically used to prevent "Check-and-Counter" rotations.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is blocked by Pokémon with the **Good as Gold** ability or those behind a **Substitute** (in certain generations).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Blocked by Magic Coat/Magic Bounce; Not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (7 learners), restricted almost exclusively to arachnid-based Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by its original thematic users, **Ariados** and **Galvantula**, as well as the Generation VII water-spider **Araquanid**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as "coverage." Instead, it defines the utility kit of the few Pokémon that learn it. **Araquanid** may use it to trap a foe it can then wall with its high Special Defense and Water Bubble-boosted resistances.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available as a TM or TR, making it a "Natural" or "Egg Move" exclusive to specific biological lines. In early generations (Gen 2), it was a hallmark move for the Spinarak line in the Johto region.
