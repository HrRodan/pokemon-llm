**## Identity & Mechanics**
**Devastating Drake (Special)** is a Special Dragon-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** The user gathers its draconic spirit and channels the immense power of a Z-Crystal to strike the target with a gargantuan, energy-based draconic force. This move manifests as a massive, soaring dragon of pure energy that crashes into the opponent, obliterating defenses through sheer mythical scale.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be activated if a Pokémon knows a Special Dragon-type move and is holding **Dragonium Z**. The power and specific effects of the move scale based on the original base move (e.g., a base move like *Draco Meteor* results in a significantly higher Power than *Dragon Pulse*).
* **Secondary Effect:** Like most Z-Moves, it bypasses the effects of *Protect* and *Detect*, dealing 25% of its total damage through the shield.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

**## Competitive Profile**
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** In the Generation VII competitive meta, this move serves as a one-time "delete button" to bypass traditional counters. Unlike *Draco Meteor*, which lowers the user's Special Attack by two stages, the Z-Move version provides massive damage **without the stat penalty**, allowing a Special Sweeper to maintain momentum. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power is determined by the base Special move (e.g., 130 BP *Draco Meteor* becomes a 195 BP *Devastating Drake*).

**## Distribution & Notable Users**
This move is available to any Pokémon capable of learning a Special Dragon-type move when equipped with **Dragonium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Kommo-o:** Often used its unique Z-Move, but frequently ran Dragonium Z for a Special nuke before its signature crystal was available.
    * **Hydreigon:** A premier user that utilizes this to break through bulky neutral targets or opposing Dragons.
    * **Latios/Latias:** Often equipped this to lure in and OHKO threats that would otherwise survive a standard *Dragon Pulse*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Naganadel** or **Dialga** to provide a high-accuracy, high-damage burst that ignores the negative side effects of their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Dragonium Z** crystal, typically obtained in the Alola region after completing the trial at Vast Poni Canyon.
