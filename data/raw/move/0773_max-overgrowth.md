## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Overgrowth** is a variable-category **Grass**-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region) as a signature mechanic of the Dynamax phenomenon.
* **Description:** A colossal manifestation of nature's power where the user summons massive, thorny vines and explosive floral growth to crush the target. This surge of life energy is so potent that it instantly transforms the battlefield into a lush **Grassy Terrain** for five turns.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and replaces the current battlefield terrain with Grassy Terrain. While active, Grassy Terrain heals grounded Pokémon by 1/16th of their max HP each turn and boosts the power of Grass-type moves by 30%.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to set **Grassy Terrain**. It also reduces the power of moves like Earthquake, Bulldoze, and Magnitude by 50% for grounded Pokémon.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 90–150], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Field-Controlling Nuke** / **Terrain Setter**.
* **Usage:** Primarily used to override an opponent's terrain (such as Psychic or Electric Terrain) while dealing massive damage. Because it **bypasses accuracy checks**, it is a guaranteed hit unless the opponent is using Protect (which still allows for 25% chip damage). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Power scales based on the base move used; for example, using Leaf Storm results in a 140 BP Max Overgrowth.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move has a **universal distribution** among any Pokémon capable of learning a Grass-type move when they are under the effects of Dynamax.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Rillaboom:** Frequently uses Max Overgrowth to reset its own Grassy Terrain or to hit for massive STAB damage alongside its *Grassy Surge* ability.
    * **Venusaur:** A terrifying threat in Sun teams (under G-Max or standard Dynamax), using Max Overgrowth to secure KOs on bulky Water-types like Suicune or Fini.
    * **Kartana:** Utilizes this move as a physical nuke to break through defensive walls while gaining passive recovery from the terrain.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Grass Pokémon like **Garchomp** or **Tyranitar** (via moves like Trailblaze or Solar Beam in specific formats) to disrupt opposing terrain-based strategies or to provide team-wide healing.
* **Acquisition:** Dynamax-exclusive; only accessible during a Dynamax transformation in Generation VIII.
