## Identity & Mechanics
**Foresight** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user focuses its mind to identify the opponent's true form, seeing through illusions and ghostly intangibility. By predicting the target's movements, the user negates any evasive maneuvers and allows spectral entities to be struck by physical force.
* **Effect:** Resets the target’s evasion stat to neutral and prevents the target from raising its evasion while it remains on the field. Most notably, it identifies Ghost-type Pokémon, allowing them to be hit by **Normal** and **Fighting-type** moves.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. This move ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers to ensure it never misses.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy), PP 40.
* **Role:** Utility / Counter-Meta.
* **Usage:** Foresight serves as a niche tech choice primarily used to bypass the Ghost-type's immunity to Fighting-type moves. While largely outclassed in modern competitive play by the ability **Scrappy** (which provides the same effect passively), Foresight was historically used by Fighting-types to ensure their powerful STAB moves could land on switch-ins like Gengar or Misdreavus. It also acts as a hard counter to "Evasion-stalling" strategies involving Double Team or Minimize. It enables **Normal** and **Fighting** moves to deal neutral damage to **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses Protect/Detect in certain earlier generations depending on the specific game engine, though generally blocked by standard protection.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), often found on Pokémon with keen senses or martial arts prowess.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by Fighting-type specialists like **Machamp**, **Hitmonlee**, and **Lucario** to threaten Ghost-types. It is also a signature part of the flavor for the **Hoothoot/Noctowl** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Swampert** or **Decidueye** in specialized playthroughs or lower-tier formats where specific Ghost-type walls need to be broken without switching out.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up; it has rarely been available as a TM, making its distribution limited to its natural learner set. Note: This move was removed from the movepool in Pokémon Sword & Shield (Generation VIII).
