## Identity & Mechanics
**Ember** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user attacks the target by exhaling or launching small, flickering flames and glowing sparks. As a fundamental pyrotechnic technique, it represents the most basic manipulation of fire energy, often serving as the primary offensive tool for young Fire-type Pokémon. This move is essential for early-game progression and provides a thematic introduction to the Burn status mechanic.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10%** chance to inflict a **Burn**, which periodicially damages the target and halves its Physical Attack stat.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Progression Tool.
* **Usage:** While highly reliable due to its perfect accuracy, Ember is strictly a "stepping stone" move. In competitive play, it is almost entirely outclassed by **Flamethrower** (higher power), **Fire Blast** (nuke potential), or **Lava Plume** (higher burn chance). It sees niche use only in the earliest stages of "Little Cup" (LC) formats or during a casual playthrough. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Grass, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses effects that specifically target physical contact; benefits from **Flash Fire** boosts and **Sunny Day** weather conditions.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (89 learners), primarily concentrated among Fire-type species.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fire-type starters across all generations, including **Charmander**, **Cyndaquil**, **Chimchar**, and **Fuecoco**. It is also a base move for legendaries like **Entei** and **Heatran**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally found in the early level-up pools of non-Fire types such as **Bagon** and **Salamence**, providing them with a temporary special fire option before they access stronger physical coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned via leveling up; it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, as it is intended to be replaced by mid-game by more powerful options.
