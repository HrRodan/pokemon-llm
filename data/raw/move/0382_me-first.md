## Identity & Mechanics
**Me First** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user focuses its senses to anticipate the opponent's next strike, intercepting the attack with a preemptive execution of that very same move. By stealing the target's momentum, the user unleashes the copied attack with significantly heightened intensity. This move relies heavily on superior speed and psychological anticipation to turn an opponent's offensive strength against them.
* **Effect:** If the user moves before the target and the target has selected a damaging move, the user copies that move and executes it with a **50% power increase (1.5x multiplier)**. The move fails if the target moves first, selects a status move, or if the copied move is a specialized attack that cannot be mimicked.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The power boost is an inherent part of the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Counter-Offense / High-Risk Nuke.
* **Usage:** Me First is a high-skill ceiling move used primarily on extremely fast "Glass Cannons." It serves as a devastating **Check** to Dragon-types or Ghost-types, as copying their STAB moves (which are often super effective against themselves) with a 1.5x multiplier results in an immediate OHKO. It is often compared to **Mirror Move** or **Copycat**, but is more aggressive due to the priority requirement and power boost. It deals **Super Effective** damage based on the type of the move copied, making it a versatile but unpredictable tool.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks (the move itself always "hits," but the copied move follows its own accuracy check). It cannot be called by Assist, Metronome, or Sleep Talk.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (39 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon known for high speed or tactical versatility.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Mewtwo**, **Pheromosa**, and **Lucario**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Absol** or **Stantler** to punish predictable offensive threats, particularly in lower-tier competitive brackets. 
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up or as an Egg Move; it has never been a widely available TM/TR, making its presence on a team a niche surprise factor.
