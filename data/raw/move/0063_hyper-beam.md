## Identity & Mechanics
**Hyper Beam** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy into a concentrated sphere before unleashing a massive, blinding beam of pure destructive force at the target. This cataclysmic discharge of energy is so taxing that the user must spend the following turn cooling down and recovering its stamina.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. If the move hits, the user is forced to "recharge" on the next turn, preventing it from attacking, using items, or switching out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Recharge is a mandatory mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Finisher.
* **Usage:** Hyper Beam is the quintessential "all-or-nothing" move. While its raw power is among the highest in the game, the recharge turn leaves the user completely vulnerable to being "setup bait" or an easy Revenge Kill. In modern competitive play, it is generally outclassed by more consistent options like **Tri Attack** or **Boomburst**, unless utilized by Pokémon with abilities like **Pixilate** or **Refrigerate** which change its type and grant a power boost, turning it into a specialized nuke. Historically, in Generation I, the recharge turn was skipped if the move secured a knockout, making it a premier competitive threat.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types. **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** High-crit ratio is not inherent, but it is considered a "beam" move for certain visual mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution, with **735** Pokémon capable of learning it, making it one of the most accessible TMs in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Dragonite**, **Porygon-Z** (which leverages *Adaptability* for massive damage), and **Mewtwo**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Sylveon** or **Mega Gardevoir** (via *Pixilate*) to transform it into a 190+ Power Fairy-type nuke, or on **Mega Salamence** (via *Aerilate*) for a Flying-type variant.
* **Acquisition:** It has been a staple **TM (TM15 in most games)** or **TR** in every single generation, typically sold at Department Stores or Game Corners as a high-tier reward.
