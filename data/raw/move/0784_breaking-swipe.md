## Identity & Mechanics
**Breaking Swipe** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user swings its powerful tail, claws, or body in a wide, sweeping arc to lash out at all nearby foes. This disruptive maneuver not only deals damage but also rattles the opponents' physical momentum, effectively dampening their offensive pressure. In a retrieval context, this move is characterized as a "Physical Snarl" or a spread-damage debuffing tool.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and guaranteed to lower the target's Attack stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Attack.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Doubles/VGC).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Crowd Control / Support.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Breaking Swipe is a premier utility move in Double Battles (VGC). Its ability to hit both opponents and reliably drop their Attack makes it an "Intimidate" alternative that bypasses certain "Clear Body" or "White Smoke" interactions if the user can land the hit. It is often preferred over **Dragon Claw** in defensive or balance-oriented builds to increase team longevity. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (93 learners), primarily granted to Pokémon with reptilian or draconic features.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Rayquaza**, **Garchomp**, **Koraidon**, and **Baxcalibur**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon Pokémon like **Tyranitar**, **Charizard**, and **Rhyperior** to provide physical mitigation and neutral chip damage against non-Fairy opponents.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in Gen VIII and Gen IX, making it a staple customization option for most Physical attackers.
