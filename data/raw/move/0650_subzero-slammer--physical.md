## Identity & Mechanics
**Subzero Slammer (Physical)** is a Physical Ice-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Harnessing the absolute zero temperatures of Alola’s Z-Power, the user dramatically drops the local climate to create a catastrophic glacial environment. The user then strikes the target with the full force of a mountain-sized iceberg or a flash-freeze impact. This move is a specialized "Z-Upgrade" of a base physical Ice-type move, characterized by its extreme biting cold and crushing physical pressure.
* **Effect:** This move is a one-time powerful attack that can only be used if the Pokémon holds an **Icium Z** and knows a physical Ice-type move. It bypasses accuracy checks to always hit the target (unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig). Its base power is determined by the power of the original move (e.g., *Icicle Crash* becomes a 160 BP move).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Z-Moves generally do not carry the secondary effects of their base moves).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used to secure a OHKO (One-Hit Knock Out) on defensive threats that might otherwise survive a standard Ice-type attack. It is particularly effective for physical attackers who rely on moves with shaky accuracy, such as *Icicle Crash*, as the Z-Move version is guaranteed to land. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ground, Flying, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power scales with the base move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Distribution is universal among Pokémon that can learn at least one physical Ice-type move and have access to the **Icium Z** crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Kyurem-Black:** Famous for using this move to circumvent its lack of a reliable physical Ice-type STAB, turning *Freeze Shock* into a 200 BP nuke or *Icicle Spear* into a reliable hit.
    * **Weavile:** Utilizes its high Attack and Speed to delete opposing Dragon and Flying types instantly.
    * **Mamoswine:** Uses it to break through physical walls like Ferrothorn or Landorus-T after chip damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Dragonite** or **Gyarados** (running *Ice Punch* or *Ice Fang*) to lure in and surprise-KO 4x Ice-weak checks like Gliscor or opposing Dragon-types.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Icium Z** Key Item, found in Mount Lanakila. This mechanic was retired in later generations.
