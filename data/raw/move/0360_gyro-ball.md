## Identity & Mechanics
**Gyro Ball** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user rapidly rotates its body, generating intense centrifugal force and momentum before slamming into the target. This high-speed spin converts the user's lack of agility into destructive kinetic energy; the more the target outpaces the user, the more devastating the impact becomes. It is the signature offensive tool for heavy, sluggish combatants.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on a comparison of the target's current Speed to the user's current Speed. The base power is calculated using the formula: `1 + 25 × (Target Speed / User Speed)`, with a maximum power cap of **150**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable/Max 150], Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Speed-Punishing Nuke / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Gyro Ball is a cornerstone move for Pokémon with naturally low Speed stats, often used in conjunction with a **0 Speed IV** and a Speed-lowering nature (like Brave or Relaxed) to maximize damage. It serves as a direct counter to "Fast Sweepers." While **Iron Head** is preferred for its flinch chance on faster Pokémon, Gyro Ball is the superior choice for "Wallbreakers" and "Tanky" Steel-types who operate under **Trick Room** or possess abysmal base speed. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (167 learners), primarily found among Steel, Rock, and Ground types.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Ferrothorn**, which uses it to punish fast Fairy and Ice types. It is also a primary STAB move for **Stakataka** (the hardest-hitting user due to its extremely low speed) and **Bronzong**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy Pokémon like **Forretress**, **Steelix**, and **Aegislash** to capitalize on their low speed tiers. Even non-Steel types like **Snorlax** or **Avalugg** may occasionally carry it to check fast threats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** (TM74 or TR52 depending on the generation) across almost all regions since its debut.
