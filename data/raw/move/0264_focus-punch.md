## Identity & Mechanics
**Focus Punch** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its mind and body to unleash a devastatingly powerful blow. This move requires total concentration; the user "charges" at the start of the turn and executes the punch at the very end. However, if the user takes direct damage from an opponent before the move is unleashed, their focus is shattered, causing them to flinch and the move to fail. It is the quintessential "high-risk, high-reward" physical strike.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage but fails if the user is hit by a damaging move during the turn of execution. It has a decreased priority of -3.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The move itself fails if the user is damaged).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Due to its negative priority and failure condition, Focus Punch is almost never used "naked." It is most famously paired with the move **Substitute** (the "SubPunch" strategy), allowing the user to hide behind a doll to absorb a hit while safely charging the punch. It serves as a massive nuke to punish an opponent's predicted switch. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning its power is further amplified by the **Iron Fist** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (292 learners), as many Pokémon with hands or the ability to punch can learn it via TM.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Breloom** (the gold standard for SubPunching due to Spore/Poison Heal), **Machamp**, and **Iron Hands**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Tyranitar**, **Dragonite**, or **Aggron** to lure in and demolish Steel or Rock-type counters on a predicted switch-in.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM01** in Generations III and IV, and returned as **TM058** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
