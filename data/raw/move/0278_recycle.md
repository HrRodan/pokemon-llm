## Identity & Mechanics
**Recycle** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user meticulously reconstructs or retrieves a held item that has been previously consumed, destroyed, or spent during the course of the battle. By scouring the immediate environment, the user restores its lost utility, allowing for the repeated use of powerful consumable items like Berries, Gems, or Focus Sashes.
* **Effect:** The user recovers the last item it consumed. The move will fail if the user is currently holding an item, or if the previous item was lost via moves like *Knock Off*, *Thief*, *Covet*, *Trick*, or *Switcheroo*. An item can be recycled indefinitely, provided it is consumed again between each use of the move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Sustainability Engine.
* **Usage:** Recycle is primarily used to create "infinite" recovery loops or to maintain specific defensive buffs. It is most devastating when paired with the **Gluttony** ability and a "pinch Berry" (like a Figy or Iapapa Berry), allowing a Pokémon to restore 33–50% of its health repeatedly. It is also the cornerstone of the infamous "Leppa Berry" stall strategy, which allows a Pokémon to restore its own PP indefinitely.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and is unaffected by Type Matchups, though it can be blocked by *Taunt*.
* **Attributes:** This move is bypassed by *Magic Coat* and *Magic Bounce* as it targets the user. It is not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (128 learners), primarily found among Psychic, Normal, and artificial/mechanical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Snorlax** and **Alolan Muk**, both of whom utilize the move alongside the Gluttony ability for massive HP restoration. **Porygon2** and **Blissey** also occasionally run it in stall-oriented builds.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Klefki**, which utilizes its *Prankster* ability to give Recycle priority, ensuring it can restore a Sitrus Berry or Focus Sash before taking a finishing blow. **Appletun** and **Hydrapple** also use it to capitalize on their high natural bulk and Berry-related abilities.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as TM67 during Generation IV (Sinnoh/Johto) but has since become more exclusive to level-up learnsets and specific Move Tutors in later generations.
