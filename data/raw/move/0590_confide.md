## Identity & Mechanics
**Confide** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user approaches the target and whispers a distracting secret, breaking their focus and causing them to lose their fighting spirit. This mental disruption manifests as a decrease in the target's ability to manifest special energy. Because it is a **sound-based move**, it resonates through barriers, effectively bypassing the effects of **Substitute**.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Special Attack stat by one stage (-1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The stat reduction is the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks) | PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Debuff.
* **Usage:** Confide is a niche utility move primarily used to neuter Special Attackers. Its most significant competitive trait is its classification as a **sound move**, allowing it to affect Pokémon behind a **Substitute**, unlike many other status moves. It is often compared to **Snarl**, which deals damage while lowering Special Attack, or **Eerie Impulse**, which lowers Special Attack by two stages but has limited distribution. Confide is often selected for its perfect accuracy and universal availability in earlier generations.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move; it fails against Pokémon with the **Soundproof** Ability but ignores Substitute. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Confide has an extremely wide distribution, with a staggering **944 learners**, as it served as a "Universal TM" (TM100) in Generations VI and VII.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on defensive stalwarts and pivots like **Clefable**, **Chansey/Blissey**, and **Mew**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by Pokémon like **Incineroar** or **Tyranitar** in specific VGC or doubles formats to weaken special-offense threats that rely on Substitute for protection. 
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available via **TM100** in *X/Y, Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, Sun/Moon,* and *Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon*. However, its availability has been significantly restricted in later generations (Gen VIII+), making it a rare legacy move in modern competitive formats.
