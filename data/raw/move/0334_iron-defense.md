## Identity & Mechanics
**Iron Defense** is a Status Steel-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user chemically or physically hardens its body's surface to the density of tempered steel, creating a metallic sheen that acts as impenetrable armor. This transformation significantly bolsters the user's structural integrity, allowing them to withstand massive physical impacts and crushing blows that would otherwise cause critical damage.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user’s Defense stat by two stages (+2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —- %, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Wallbuilding / Sweeper Enabler.
* **Usage:** Primarily used by defensive tanks to become "unbreakable" against physical attackers. In modern competitive play, it is most frequently paired with **Body Press**, a move that calculates damage based on the user's Defense rather than Attack, turning this defensive setup into an offensive "Nuke." It is often preferred over *Acid Armor* due to its significantly wider distribution. While it provides no protection against Special moves, it effectively halves physical damage taken after a single use.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Can be stolen by **Snatch** or bounced back by **Magic Coat**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (290 learners), making it a staple utility move for heavy-set Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Corviknight** (as part of an Iron Defense + Body Press set), **Metagross**, **Zamazenta**, and **Registeel**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Steel Pokémon like **Toxapex**, **Garganacl**, and **Slowbro** to reinforce their roles as premier physical walls and to counter physical sweepers.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) across multiple generations, including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet.
