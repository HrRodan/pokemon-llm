## Identity & Mechanics
**Acid** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user exhales or sprays a stream of highly corrosive, digestive fluid at the target. This caustic liquid is designed to melt through organic tissue and armor alike, weakening the target’s durability over time. In multi-battle formats, this move acts as a spread attack, drenching all adjacent opponents in toxins.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to lower the target’s **Special Defense** by one stage (Note: In Generations I-III, this move lowered the physical Defense stat).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Niche Spread Chip.
* **Usage:** In a competitive context, Acid is largely outclassed by **Sludge Bomb** (higher power and poison chance) or **Sludge Wave** (superior spread damage). Its primary value is found in the early levels of a playthrough or as a low-cost spread move in specific restricted formats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses effects like Bulletproof (as it is not a "bomb" or "ball" move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (35 learners), primarily concentrated among acidic plants, tentacled sea creatures, and draconic Poison-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Victreebel**, **Vileplume**, and **Tentacruel** as a natural level-up move. It is also an early-game staple for the Ultra Beasts **Nihilego** and **Naganadel**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Eelektross** and **Seismitoad**, providing them with a way to hit Fairy-type threats before they access more powerful TM options.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is rarely available as a TM or TR in modern generations, making its distribution strictly tied to the natural movepools of Poison-type Pokémon.
