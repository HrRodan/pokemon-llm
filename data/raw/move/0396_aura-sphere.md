## Identity & Mechanics
**Aura Sphere** is a Special Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user looses a blast of aura power from deep within its body. This projectile is composed of concentrated spiritual energy that homes in on the target's essence. Because it tracks the opponent's life force, the attack is physically impossible to dodge, making it a "never-miss" move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move bypasses all accuracy and evasion checks, meaning it will hit even if the user’s accuracy has been lowered or the target has increased its evasion (e.g., through Double Team or Minimize).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy --%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Aura Sphere is the reliable alternative to the notoriously inaccurate *Focus Blast*. While it has lower raw power, its perfect accuracy makes it the preferred choice for Special Attackers that cannot afford a "miss" in crucial turns. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a "Pulse" and "Ball/Bomb" move. It receives a 50% power boost from the ability **Mega Launcher** (effectively making it 120 Power) and is neutralized by the ability **Bulletproof**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (59 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with high spiritual or martial themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically associated with **Lucario**, which often uses it as its primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. Other major users include **Mewtwo**, **Togekiss**, and the Paradox Pokémon **Iron Valiant**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Blastoise** and **Clawitzer** (leveraging Mega Launcher) to provide essential coverage against Steel and Dark-type threats that would otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in modern titles, including Pokémon Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet.
