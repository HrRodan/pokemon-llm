## Identity & Mechanics
**Beat Up** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user summons its allies to swarm the target in a coordinated assault. This move visualizes the entire active party surrounding the opponent to deliver a series of quick, brutal strikes, making it a "gang-up" style attack that punishes teams with healthy, battle-ready members.
* **Effect:** The move strikes once for every Pokémon in the user's party that does not have a major status condition (Burn, Paralyze, Sleep, Freeze, Poison) and has not fainted. In modern generations, each hit's Power is calculated based on the Base Attack stat of the Pokémon "performing" that specific hit ($Base Attack / 10 + 5$).
* **Secondary Effect:** This move uniquely ignores the target's stat stages (evasion/defense boosts) and the standard damage randomization factor. It is also one of the few moves that can **bypass the Wonder Guard ability**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Multi-hit Utility / Ability Activator.**
* **Usage:** While its damage is inconsistent in Singles due to party attrition, it is a cornerstone of specific **Doubles (VGC) archetypes**. Its most famous application is the "Beat Up + Justified" combo, where a fast user (like Whimsicott) targets an ally with the **Justified** ability (like Terrakion or Lucario). Since each hit is Dark-type and deals low damage, it triggers the ability multiple times, instantly granting the ally a +4 or +6 Attack boost. It is also excellent for breaking **Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and Multiscale**.
* **Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types. 
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; does not trigger Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet on every hit.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (66 learners), primarily found among Dark-types and aggressive, pack-oriented Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Weavile**, **Bisharp**, and **Houndoom** for STAB-boosted multi-hit pressure. 
* **Strategy/Utility Users:** **Whimsicott** is the most notorious user of this move in competitive history, using its *Prankster* ability to execute a priority Beat Up on teammates. **Maushold** and **Dragapult** are also notable modern users that utilize the move for unique damage scaling or coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Available as **TM37** in Pokémon Sword and Shield and has historically been an Egg Move for many species.
