## Identity & Mechanics
**Surf** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user summons a massive tidal wave and crashes it down upon the battlefield, inundating everything in its path. This deluge is one of the most iconic aquatic techniques, representing a powerful surge of water that can wash away opponents. In overworld gameplay across earlier generations, it was the primary HM move used for aquatic navigation.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent Special damage. If the target is currently in the first turn of the move **Dive**, Surf deals double damage (180 Base Power).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Targets all other Pokémon on the field (adjacent foes and allies in Double/Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Surf is the gold standard for Water-type Special attackers who prioritize accuracy over raw power. While **Hydro Pump** offers higher damage (110 BP), its 80% accuracy makes it risky. Conversely, while **Scald** (80 BP) provides a 30% burn chance, Surf is preferred on offensive builds that need the extra damage to reach specific KOs. In Double Battles, it acts as a powerful **Spread Move**, though it requires a partner with the *Telepathy* or *Water Absorb* ability to avoid friendly fire. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses effects that only protect against single-target moves (in Doubles).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (285 learners), being historically available to nearly every Water-type and many diverse non-Water species.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on Water-type staples like **Blastoise**, **Greninja**, **Kyogre**, and **Swampert**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Water Pokémon such as **Nidoking**, **Dragonite**, **Snorlax**, and **Heliolisk** to provide high-accuracy Special coverage against Ground and Fire-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Historically famous as **HM03**; it remains widely available as a **TM or TR** in every subsequent generation, making it one of the most accessible moves in the franchise.
