## Identity & Mechanics
**Moongeist Beam** is a Special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user calls upon lunar power to emit a sinister, spectral ray of light that pierces the target. This eerie beam of energy is infused with the void of the night sky, allowing it to bypass the mystical protections of the opponent. 
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and ignores the effects of the target's Ability that would otherwise hinder or negate the move. This "Mold Breaker" property allows it to strike through defensive shells and supernatural evasions.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but it uniquely ignores Abilities such as **Disguise**, **Multiscale**, **Sturdy**, **Levitate**, and **Shadow Shield**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Ability-Ignoring Nuke.
* **Usage:** As a signature move, it serves as the premier Ghost-type STAB option for its users, vastly outclassing Shadow Ball. Its ability to ignore **Mimikyu's Disguise** and **Dragonite's Multiscale** makes it an elite tool for bypassing "one-hit" protection mechanics that usually stop sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a "beam" move, but it notably does not have a "recharge" turn, making it highly spammable despite the low PP.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 learner in base data).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Legendary Pokémon **Lunala**. It is also the primary tool for **Dawn Wings Necrozma** (the fusion of Necrozma and Lunala), which can also upgrade this move into the Z-Move *Menacing Moonraze Litany*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its exclusive nature, it is never seen as a coverage move on non-Ghost types; it defines the offensive presence of the Pokémon that wields it.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned naturally by Lunala upon leveling up or evolving from Cosmoem.
