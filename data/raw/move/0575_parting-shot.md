## Identity & Mechanics
**Parting Shot** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user hurls a final, menacing threat or a demoralizing insult at the target before quickly retreating back into its Poké Ball. This psychological maneuver intimidates the opponent, dampening their offensive capabilities while allowing a teammate to enter the fray under safer conditions.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack and Special Attack stats by one stage each and then forces the user to switch out for another Pokémon in the party. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower both offensive stats.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Defensive Pivot** / **Momentum Generator**.
* **Usage:** Parting Shot is a premier utility move, often considered the defensive counterpart to *U-turn* and *Volt Switch*. While it deals no damage, its value lies in the "double-drop" to the opponent's offenses. This effectively "cushions" the incoming Pokémon, making it significantly easier for a teammate to set up or survive a hit. It is particularly dangerous when used by Pokémon with the **Prankster** Ability or those that utilize **Intimidate** to stack stat drops. It is countered by Pokémon with *Clear Body*, *Mirror Armor*, or those holding a *Clear Amulet*.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** blocked by *Protect* (in terms of the switch-out effect in some contexts), but if the stat reduction is blocked (e.g., by *Substitute* or *Magic Bounce*), the user will generally fail to switch out.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 learners), making it a high-value asset for those who possess it.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Incineroar:** The premier user in VGC/Doubles; it cycles *Intimidate* and *Parting Shot* to neuter physical attackers completely.
    * **Grimmsnarl:** Often uses *Prankster* to priority-debuff an opponent before pivoting into a sweeper.
    * **Silvally:** Uses the move to maintain momentum in various elemental forms.
    * **Pangoro:** One of the original thematic users of the move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Munkidori** and **Pecharunt** (Generation IX) to provide tactical pivots for Poison-based team archetypes.
* **Acquisition:** Historically rare; it is not a standard TM/TR in most generations, often requiring specific leveling or being part of a specialized move pool for Dark-types and "menacing" Pokémon.
