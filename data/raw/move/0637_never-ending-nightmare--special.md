## Identity & Mechanics
**Never-Ending Nightmare (Special)** is a Special Ghost-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** This move represents the ultimate manifestation of spectral power, accessible only to those wielding a **Ghostium Z** crystal. The user manifests a deep, terrifying abyss of darkness, dragging the target into a realm of eternal shadows where vengeful spirits assault them. As a Z-Move, it carries immense thematic weight, often serving as a cinematic finisher that bypasses standard evasion.
* **Effect:** This is an upgraded version of a base Special Ghost-type move (such as Shadow Ball or Hex). Its power is determined by the base move it is derived from (e.g., a Shadow Ball-based Never-Ending Nightmare has **160 Power**). It ignores accuracy checks and bypasses the damage-nullifying effects of *Protect* or *Detect*, though it deals reduced damage (25%) through such barriers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. (Z-Moves typically lose the secondary effects of their base moves in favor of raw power).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **One-time Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats (SM/USUM) to delete a specific threat that would otherwise wall a Special Attacker. Unlike the standard Shadow Ball, this move provides the sheer force necessary to OHKO bulky **Psychic** or **Ghost** types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; ignores accuracy modifiers; hits through protection for chip damage.
