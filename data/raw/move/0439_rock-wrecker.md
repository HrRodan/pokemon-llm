## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Wrecker** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user exerts immense physical strength to launch a colossal, mountain-sized boulder at the target. The sheer force of the projectile causes massive kinetic impact, but the exertion is so great that the user is momentarily immobilized. This move is the Rock-type thematic equivalent to Giga Impact or Frenzy Plant.
* **Effect:** Inflicts heavy damage on the target. If the move hits, the user must spend the next turn "recharging." During the recharge turn, the Pokémon cannot attack, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Rock Wrecker is often considered a "last-resort" move or a situational nuke. In standard competitive play, it is generally outclassed by **Stone Edge** or **Rock Slide** because the mandatory recharge turn allows opponents to safely switch in a counter or use the turn to set up (Entry Hazards, Dragon Dance, etc.). However, it sees niche use in specialized strategies or when converted into a **Z-Move (Continental Crush)** or **Max Move (Max Rockfall)** to bypass the recharge penalty while maintaining massive base power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range Physical attack; does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature-style move for only 3 Pokémon across two evolutionary lines.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Rhyperior**, for whom it serves as a thematic signature move. It is also learned by **Crustle** and its pre-evolution **Dwebble**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its hyper-exclusive distribution, it is never seen as a coverage option on non-Rock-type Pokémon. 
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned exclusively through leveling up by its specific users, making it one of the rarer moves in the franchise.
