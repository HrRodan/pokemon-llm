## Identity & Mechanics
**Morning Sun** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto region).
* **Description:** The user bathing in the first rays of the sun, gathering solar energy to revitalize its body and restore health. This move is a weather-dependent recovery tool, drawing power directly from the environmental light levels to dictate the potency of its healing.
* **Effect:** The user restores a portion of its maximum HP based on the current weather conditions. 
    * **Clear/No Weather:** Restores **50%** of max HP.
    * **Harsh Sunlight:** Restores **66.7% (2/3)** of max HP.
    * **Rain, Sandstorm, or Snow/Hail:** Restores only **25%** of max HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self-healing).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Weather-Dependent Recovery / Sustain.
* **Usage:** Morning Sun serves as the primary recovery tool for several high-tier threats that lack access to more consistent moves like *Recover* or *Soft-Boiled*. While it provides a massive HP boost under Sun (synergizing perfectly with **Sun Teams** and **Protosynthesis** users), it is inherently risky in a competitive meta dominated by "Weather Wars." A sudden switch to a Sandstream (Tyranitar) or Drizzle (Pelipper) user can effectively halve the move's healing output, turning a reliable heal into a wasted turn.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a "Healing Move," meaning it is blocked by *Heal Block* and its effects are boosted by the *Triage* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic, Fire, and Light-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Espeon:** Iconic user that relies on Morning Sun to maintain longevity as a Magic Bounce utility pivot or Calm Mind sweeper.
    * **Solgaleo / Necrozma-Dusk-Mane:** Crucial for these bulky Steel/Psychic Legendaries to maintain their "Wallbreaker" or "Tank" status in the Ubers tier.
    * **Volcarona (Larvesta):** Often runs Morning Sun on bulkier "Quiver Dance" sets to punish passive switches and setup indefinitely.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Paradox Pokémon like **Slither Wing** and **Iron Moth**, who utilize the move to take advantage of the Sun they often reside in to act as durable offensive pivots.
* **Acquisition:** Generally acquired through Level-Up or as an Egg Move. Unlike *Rest*, it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making it a rare and valuable asset for the specific Pokémon that learn it.
