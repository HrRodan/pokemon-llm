## Identity & Mechanics
**Covet** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user approaches the target with an endearing, pleading demeanor, acting "cutely" to lower the opponent's guard. While the target is distracted by this display, the user nimbly snatches their held item. This move is a primary tool for **item theft** and **disruption**, combining low-power physical contact with high utility.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. If the target is holding an item and the user is not, the user steals the item. The theft is permanent in-game but lasts only for the duration of the match in competitive play. Damage is dealt even if no item is stolen.
* **Secondary Effect:** Item theft (100% chance if conditions are met). Pokémon with the **Sticky Hold** ability or those holding "un-thievable" items (like Mega Stones, Z-Crystals, or Plates on a Pokémon with **Multitype**) are immune to the theft.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Utility / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Covet is the Normal-type counterpart to the move *Thief*. While its damage is mediocre, it is used strategically in "itemless" sets—often involving the use of a consumable item like a **Focus Sash** or **Berry**—allowing the user to "re-arm" themselves by stealing from the opponent. It is particularly effective at removing crucial items like **Leftovers**, **Choice Specs**, or **Eviolite** from defensive walls.
* **Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types and does **not** hit any type for Super Effective damage. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** and cannot hit **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Static*.
