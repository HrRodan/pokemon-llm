## Identity & Mechanics
**Scary Face** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user assumes a terrifying expression or glares intensely at the target, instilling a deep sense of fear that hinders their ability to move. This psychological pressure causes the target to recoil and stiffen, resulting in a dramatic drop in their agility and reaction time.
* **Effect:** Sharply lowers the target's Speed stat by two stages (-2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% success rate barring protection or accuracy checks).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Speed Control / Utility.
* **Usage:** While often overlooked in favor of damaging speed control (like *Icy Wind* or *Electroweb*), Scary Face is a potent **Speed Nuke**. Because it reduces Speed by two stages, it effectively halves the target's Speed immediately, allowing even very slow "Wallbreakers" to outspeed fast "Sweepers." In the VGC (Doubles) format, it is a niche but effective tool for neutralizing "Booster Energy" or "Choice Scarf" users. Unlike damaging moves, it does not trigger certain items like *Weakness Policy*, but it is blocked by *Substitute*.
* **Attributes:** As a Normal-type Status move, it can target **Ghost-types** successfully. It is blocked by abilities like *Clear Body*, *White Smoke*, and *Full Metal Body*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (429 learners), found across nearly all biological archetypes, from intimidating predators to spectral entities.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by apex predators such as **Tyranitar**, **Garchomp**, **Salamence**, and **Charizard**. It is also a staple in the movepools of "Box Art Legendaries" like **Groudon**, **Miraidon**, and **Koraidon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on bulky disruption Pokémon like **Incineroar** or **Grimmsnarl** to provide immediate speed tier manipulation without needing to investment in offensive stats. It is also common on **Dracovish** (in previous formats) to ensure it moves first to maximize *Fishious Rend* damage.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in most recent generations (TM26 in Sword/Shield, TM006 in Scarlet/Violet).
