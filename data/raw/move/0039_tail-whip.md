## Identity & Mechanics
**Tail Whip** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user wags its tail cutely or distractingly to make opposing Pokémon less wary. This rhythmic movement charms or misleads the target into lowering its guard, resulting in a reduction of its Physical Defense. It is a staple early-game move for many Pokémon with tails, focusing on psychological distraction rather than brute force.
* **Effect:** Lowers the Defense stat of all adjacent opponents by one stage (-1 Defense). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The stat reduction is the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (In Double Battles, it hits both foes simultaneously without affecting the ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game Utility / Niche Doubles Support.
* **Usage:** In single-player campaigns, it serves as a basic tool to help Physical attackers breakthrough bulky opponents during the early levels. In competitive play, it is almost entirely outclassed by moves like **Screech** (which lowers Defense by two stages) or **Leer** (which is identical in effect but distributed to different Pokémon). However, its ability to hit both opponents in Doubles makes it a very niche choice for certain support sets to soften the field for a **Physical Sweeper** partner.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal direct damage. However, it facilitates increased damage against all types except those with abilities like **Clear Body**, **Hyper Cutter**, or those behind a **Substitute**.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses "King's Rock" flinch chances.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (146 learners), primarily found on mammalian or reptilian Pokémon with prominent tails.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Pikachu**, **Blastoise**, **Eevee** (and its various Eeveelutions), and **Meowscarada**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for "coverage," it is found on heavy-hitting physical Legendaries like **Glastrier** and **Melmetal**, where it can technically be used to force a switch or punish a defensive wall, though high-base-power attacks are usually preferred.
* **Acquisition:** Tail Whip is almost exclusively learned via **Level-up** at very low levels (usually Level 1-10). It is historically not available as a TM or TR, making it a "natural" move for most of its learners.
