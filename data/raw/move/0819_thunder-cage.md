## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunder Cage** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user discharges a massive amount of electrical energy that manifests as a physical cage of high-voltage bolts, encircling the opponent. This move crackles with intense static energy, preventing the target's escape while subjecting them to continuous electrical shocks.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and traps the target for four to five turns. While trapped, the target cannot switch out (unless using a pivoting move like U-turn) and takes 1/8th of its maximum HP as damage at the end of each turn (1/6th if the user is holding a Binding Band).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to induce the **Trapping** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Trapping Utility / Wallbreaker Support.**
* **Usage:** Thunder Cage is a high-utility signature move. Compared to the standard **Thunderbolt** (90 Power / 100 Accuracy), Thunder Cage sacrifices raw power and reliability for the immense tactical advantage of preventing the opponent from switching. It is used to "trap and remove" specific threats, allowing the user to chip away at defensive walls that cannot escape. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. As a Special Electric move, it benefits significantly from the **Transistor** ability, which boosts its effective damage output.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, serving as a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Regieleki**. It is the cornerstone of many Regieleki sets, allowing it to trap bulky Water-types or neutral targets and wear them down with residual damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is exclusive to Regieleki, it is not seen as coverage on other Pokémon. However, Regieleki uses it to punish predicted switches; if a Ground-type switches into a Thunder Cage, it takes no initial damage but can still be pressured by Regieleki's teammates if the Ground-type is forced to stay in or if Regieleki pivots out.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned strictly by leveling up the legendary titan Regieleki.
