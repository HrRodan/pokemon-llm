## Identity & Mechanics
**Darkest Lariat** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user violently spins their body with arms outstretched, utilizing centrifugal force to strike the target with a powerful clothesline. This dark-energy-infused physical assault is performed with such momentum that it slices through the opponent's defensive preparations.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage while completely ignoring the target's stat modifiers. This includes ignoring boosts to the target's Defense and Evasion. Note that it does *not* ignore the user's own Attack drops or the target's screens (Reflect).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Setup Tool.
* **Usage:** While often compared to *Knock Off* for its utility or *Crunch* for its potential Defense drops, Darkest Lariat serves as a specialized **counter-measure against defensive setup**. It is the premier choice for bypassng "Iron Defense" or "Cosmic Power" boosters that would otherwise wall physical attackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (21 total learners), originally serving as the signature move of Incineroar.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by its original master **Incineroar**, as well as powerful physical attackers like **Urshifu (Single Strike Style)** and **Zarude**, who benefit from its reliability.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a high-impact coverage option on non-Dark Pokémon such as **Rillaboom**, **Melmetal**, and **Snorlax** to punish Ghost-type switch-ins or bulky Psychic-types.
* **Acquisition:** While it began as a signature move, it became more accessible in Generation VIII as **TR93**, allowing a wider variety of muscular or "heavy-hitter" Pokémon to adopt it into their movepools.
