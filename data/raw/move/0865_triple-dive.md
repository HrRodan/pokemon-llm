## Identity & Mechanics
**Triple Dive** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user performs a series of three perfectly synchronized dives, impacting the target with high-pressure splashes of water in rapid succession. This multi-strike animation reflects the agile, serpentine nature of its primary users, delivering three distinct physical blows in a single turn.
* **Effect:** Triple Dive is a multi-strike move that hits the target exactly three times. Each hit has its own independent check for critical hits.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Each hit processes individual contact effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30 (per hit / 90 total), Accuracy 95%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable Multi-Strike STAB / Shield Breaker.
* **Usage:** With a combined base power of 90, Triple Dive serves as a specialized alternative to moves like Liquidation. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to bypass **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, and break through **Substitutes** or **Disguise** (Mimikyu), as the subsequent hits will damage the target after the protection is removed. However, its 95% accuracy introduces a slight risk of missing entirely compared to 100% accuracy options. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**, meaning it is affected by items like Rocky Helmet and abilities like Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move for its primary user (1 learner total).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Wugtrio**, the "Garden Eel" Pokémon of the Paldea region. It is the core STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for Wugtrio, synergizing with its high speed to pressure frailer leads.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is currently not seen on non-Water Pokémon for coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally through leveling up by its signature user.
