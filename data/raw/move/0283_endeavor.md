## Identity & Mechanics
**Endeavor** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user puts forth every ounce of its remaining strength to bring the opponent down to its level. In a burst of desperate energy, it deals precise damage to ensure the target's current HP matches the user's current HP. This move is highly thematic, representing a "last stand" effort in battle.
* **Effect:** Inflicts fixed damage to reduce the target's HP until it is equal to the user's current HP. If the target's HP is already equal to or lower than the user's, the move fails. While it is a Normal-type move, it ignores standard type effectiveness (resistances) but is blocked by Ghost-type immunity.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** HP Equalizer / Revenge Utility.
* **Usage:** Endeavor is the cornerstone of the infamous **"F.E.A.R." strategy** (Focus Sash, Endeavor, Quick Attack, Rattata). It is most effective when the user is at 1 HP, instantly stripping a full-health "Wall" or "Sweeper" of nearly all its life. Unlike Super Fang, which halves HP, Endeavor can potentially deal hundreds of points of damage in a single turn if the user is near fainting. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **None** (Normal type), but its fixed-damage nature makes it a potent threat against any non-Ghost-type HP-tank.
* **Attributes:** This move makes contact. It is hindered by its extremely low PP, making it vulnerable to Pressure users or prolonged stalls.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (371 learners), appearing frequently across various biological archetypes.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Rattata** (the original F.E.A.R. user), **Swellow**, and **Staraptor**. It is also a staple on **Aron** and **Aggron** sets utilizing the "Sturdy" ability to ensure they survive at 1 HP.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Cottonee** or **Whimsicott** (leveraging Prankster for priority) and **Pachirisu** to neutralize threats that they cannot otherwise damage significantly.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a Move Tutor or Level-up move, it has become more accessible as a **TM** in recent titles like *Scarlet & Violet*.
