## Identity & Mechanics
**Karate Chop** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user delivers a sharp, downward chop with the edge of their hand aimed at the target's vital points. This martial arts strike is executed with precision, designed to bypass defenses by landing a focused blow. In Generation I, it was originally a Normal-type move, but was reclassified to Fighting-type in subsequent generations to better reflect its thematic nature.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move possesses a **High Critical Hit Ratio**, meaning the user's critical hit stage is increased by one level (effectively a 12.5% chance to crit in modern mechanics without other modifiers).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The high crit rate is an inherent property of the move).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 25 (Max 40).
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** While Karate Chop offers high reliability and an increased crit chance, it is generally considered a "Starting Move" or "Leveling Move." In competitive play, it is almost entirely outclassed by higher-base-power Fighting moves like **Close Combat**, **Brick Break**, or **Drain Punch**. However, its niche lies in its high crit rate, which allows it to occasionally bypass a target’s defensive stat boosts (Bulk Up, Iron Defense). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (11 learners), primarily localized to Pokémon with humanoid or martial-artist physiologies.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically associated with the **Machop line (Machamp)** and the **Mankey line (Primeape)**, often serving as their primary Fighting STAB during the early levels. It is also utilized by **Hawlucha** and **Sawk**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Interestingly, it is learned by baby Pokémon **Elekid** and **Magby**, providing them with rare Fighting-type physical coverage in their base forms to deal with Rock or Steel types.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is **not available as a TM or TR** in modern generations, making its distribution strictly limited to those who learn it naturally or through breeding.
