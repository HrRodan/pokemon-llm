## Identity & Mechanics
**Acid Downpour (Special)** is a Special Poison-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** Through the power of the **Poisonium Z** crystal, the user creates a localized, catastrophic deluge of highly corrosive chemicals. The user gathers its Z-Power and floods the battlefield with a toxic, acidic swamp that dissolves the target's defenses. This move represents the absolute pinnacle of Poison-type offensive energy.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that deals massive damage. Its power is calculated based on the base Poison-type move used to trigger it. Unlike standard moves, it bypasses accuracy checks and ignores evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Z-Moves generally focus on pure damage output). If the target uses Protect or Detect, the move still deals 25% of its original damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1 (Uses Z-Crystal).
* **Role:** **High-Voltage Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Acid Downpour is the primary tool for Poison-type Special attackers to secure KOs on bulky **Fairy** or **Grass** types that might otherwise survive a Sludge Bomb. Because it never misses, it is a reliable way to shut down evasive threats or "force" a breakthrough against defensive cores. It is the definitive counter-measure against the Alolan "Tapu" Guardians (Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini).
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy** and **Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Damage is mitigated by Protect but not negated.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn any Special Poison-type move, provided they hold a **Poisonium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Nihilego:** Often used it to immediately threaten and OHKO Tapu Fini or other specially defensive Fairy-types.
    * **Gengar:** Utilized it to amplify its high Special Attack into a one-time nuke that few non-Steel types could switch into.
    * **Naganadel:** Used its high speed and STAB Acid Downpour to sweep through teams after a Beast Boost.
    * **Salazzle:** Frequently used it to bypass its own fragility by deleting a threat before it could retaliate.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Silvally-Poison** or specific coverage users to provide a surprise "nuke" against problematic Fairy-type walls like Clefable.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Poisonium Z** Crystal, obtained in Alola after completing the trial at the Shady House in Po Town.
