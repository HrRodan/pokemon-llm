## Identity & Mechanics
**Dynamic Punch** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user gathers all its power into a single, devastating punch aimed at the opponent. While the attack is notoriously difficult to land due to its erratic nature, the sheer force of the impact causes a massive concussion, leaving the target completely disoriented. This move is characterized by high physical impact and is classified as a punching move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to cause the Confusion status condition if it hits.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Confuse the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 50%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Status Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Due to its abysmal 50% accuracy, Dynamic Punch is rarely used in standard competitive play unless paired with the ability **No Guard**, which bypasses accuracy checks. In this specific niche, it becomes a terrifying "Stallbreaker" and "Confusion-Locker," forcing switches and disrupting enemy tempos. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and a **Punching** move, meaning its power is increased by 20% when used by a Pokémon with the **Iron Fist** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (141 learners), primarily among humanoid and muscular Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** The most iconic user is **Machamp**, which utilizes the **No Guard** ability to make Dynamic Punch 100% accurate, making it a staple of its moveset. Other notable STAB users include **Conkeldurr** (Iron Fist boost), **Poliwrath**, and **Golurk** (another No Guard user).
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on high-attack threats like **Tyranitar**, **Dragonite**, and **Snorlax** in earlier generations (Gen 2) to punish Steel and Normal-type switch-ins, though it has largely been replaced by more reliable options like Superpower or Close Combat in modern formats.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as **TM01** in the Johto region (Gold/Silver/Crystal). In later generations, it is often taught via Move Tutors or inherited through breeding.
