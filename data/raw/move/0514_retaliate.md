## Identity & Mechanics
**Retaliate** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user lunges at the opponent with a strike fueled by vengeful rage, seeking to avenge a fallen comrade. When an ally has been knocked out just moments before, the user’s determination manifests as a massive surge in kinetic force, effectively doubling the impact of the blow. This move is a staple for "Revenge Killer" archetypes who enter the field immediately after a teammate faints.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If a friendly Pokémon fainted on the previous turn, the base power of this move is doubled.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70 (140 when triggered), Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Revenge Killer.
* **Usage:** Retaliate serves as a powerful but situational burst tool. Compared to **Facade**, which relies on the user being status-afflicted, or **Double-Edge**, which inflicts recoil, Retaliate offers a massive 140 BP hit with no drawback—provided it is used the very turn the user switches in following a teammate's KO. Because of its extremely low PP (5), it is rarely a primary attacking move and is instead used as a tactical "one-shot" nuclear option to regain momentum.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and **Ghost** types are immune. It does not deal Super Effective damage to any type.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (244 learners), making it a common sight across various tiers.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Stoutland** (its thematic Gen 5 user), **Slaking** (which utilizes its astronomical Attack stat to fire off a 140 BP nuke), and **Snorlax**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon like **Kingambit**, **Zacian-Crowned**, and **Urshifu** as a way to punish opponents immediately after a teammate falls, bypassing the need for setup.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM67** in Gen 5 and 6, and **TR39** in Generation 8 (Sword/Shield).
