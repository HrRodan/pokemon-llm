## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Whip** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user violently lashes the target by whirling thick vines, tentacles, or whip-like appendages with immense force. It is a high-impact physical strike that emphasizes raw destructive power over precision, often used by Pokémon with botanical or flexible anatomical features.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive regular damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 85%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Power Whip serves as the Physical Grass-type equivalent to moves like Hydro Pump or Fire Blast. It is chosen over more reliable options like *Seed Bomb* (80 BP) or *Leaf Blade* (90 BP) when a Pokémon needs the raw power to secure One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) against bulky threats. The 85% accuracy introduces a significant risk of missing during crucial turns, but its 120 base power makes it one of the strongest non-recoil Physical Grass moves in the game. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (49 learners), primarily concentrated among plant-like or tentacled Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a staple STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for **Ferrothorn**, **Tangrowth**, **Venusaur**, and **Tsareena**. It is particularly terrifying on **Zarude** and **Ogerpon**, where it functions as a primary offensive tool.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Grass Pokémon such as **Gyarados**, **Seismitoad**, and **Goodra** to provide essential coverage against bulky Water and Ground types (like Gastrodon or Quagsire) that would otherwise wall their main attacks.
* **Acquisition:** While it was initially more exclusive, it became much more accessible in Generation VIII as **TR72**, allowing various physical attackers to adopt it for type coverage.
