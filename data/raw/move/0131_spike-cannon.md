## Identity & Mechanics
**Spike Cannon** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user launches a rapid-fire barrage of sharp, jagged spikes or needle-like protrusions from its body at the target. This projectile-based attack bombards the opponent with multiple hits in quick succession, designed to overwhelm defensive barriers and puncture through protection.
* **Effect:** This is a multi-hit move that strikes the target 2 to 5 times in a single turn. Each individual hit has its own check for a Critical Hit.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it excels at breaking **Substitute**, **Focus Sash**, and the **Sturdy** ability by hitting through them.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20 (Per hit), Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Multi-hit Physical Attacker / Sash-breaker.
* **Usage:** Spike Cannon is a niche "Consistency Option" among multi-hit moves due to its 100% accuracy. While it lacks the raw power of *Double-Edge* or the coverage of *Icicle Spear*, it provides a reliable way to chip away at opponents. It is most effective when paired with the **Skill Link** ability, which forces the move to always hit the maximum 5 times, resulting in a 100-base power attack. It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, while **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Non-Contact** move, allowing the user to strike multiple times without triggering damage from *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Iron Barbs*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (6 total learners), primarily limited to aquatic or shelled Pokémon with spiny carapaces.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Cloyster** and **Omastar**. It is also found in the movepools of **Toxapex**, **Corsola**, and **Mareanie**.
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Cloyster**, it serves as a reliable Normal-type nuke when boosted by *Shell Smash* and *Skill Link*, though it is frequently dropped in favor of *Rock Blast* and *Icicle Spear* for better Type Matchup coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Very restricted; it is not available as a TM or TR in modern generations and must be learned via level-up by its specific evolutionary lines.
