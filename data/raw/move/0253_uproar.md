## Identity & Mechanics
**Uproar** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user erupts into a continuous, cacophonous shouting match that lasts for multiple turns. This auditory onslaught creates a chaotic environment where the sheer volume of the noise makes it physically impossible for any Pokémon on the battlefield to slumber.
* **Effect:** The user is locked into using this move for 2–5 turns. While the Uproar is active, all Pokémon currently asleep are woken up immediately. Furthermore, no Pokémon can fall asleep (including through the use of the move Rest) until the effect ends.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to induce the "No Sleep" field effect and lock-in).
* **Targeting:** Random Opponent (in Doubles/Triples); Single Opponent (in Singles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Continuous Special STAB / Anti-Sleep Utility.
* **Usage:** Uproar is often used as a niche "Anti-Sleep" tech or a reliable STAB option for Pokémon with the **Soundproof** or **Punk Rock** abilities. While it has solid power, the lock-in mechanic is a double-edged sword, as it prevents the user from switching or selecting a different move, making them bait for **Ghost-type** switch-ins or **Protect** stalling. It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move. It bypasses *Substitute* and is boosted by the ability *Punk Rock*, but is completely nullified by the ability *Soundproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (393 learners), making it one of the more common Special Normal-type moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Exploud**, which often pairs it with the *Scrappy* ability to hit Ghost-types; **Toxtricity**, which receives a 30% damage boost via *Punk Rock*; and **Porygon-Z**, which utilizes it for a high-damage *Adaptability*-boosted STAB.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Special attackers like **Hydreigon**, **Gengar**, or **Primarina** as a way to bypass Substitutes or to prevent an opponent from using *Spore* or *Sleep Powder* strategies.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available as a **TM/TR** in modern generations, including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet.
