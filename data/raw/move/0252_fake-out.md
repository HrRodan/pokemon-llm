## Identity & Mechanics
**Fake Out** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user catches the target off-guard by clapping its hands together or performing a sudden, startling action immediately upon entering the battlefield. This psychological pressure forces the opponent to hesitate, resulting in a guaranteed flinch. Because it relies on the element of surprise, the move fails if not used on the very first turn the Pokémon is active.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and causes the target to flinch. It has a **Priority Bracket of +3**, allowing it to outspeed almost all other attacking moves, including Extreme Speed (+2). It can only be successfully executed on the first turn the user is on the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to cause the target to **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Priority Utility / Lead Disruptor / Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** Fake Out is a cornerstone of competitive play, particularly in **VGC (Doubles)**. Its primary function is to "waste" an opponent's turn, allowing a partner Pokémon to set up (e.g., Trick Room, Tailwind) or to safely KO a threat. It is also used to break **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, and **Multiscale** abilities, ensuring a follow-up attack can secure a knockout. While it deals neutral damage to most types, it is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** and cannot hit **Ghost** types (unless the user has the Scrappy ability).
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (84 learners), primarily found among agile, primate-like, or "trickster" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** **Incineroar** is arguably the most famous user, using Fake Out to facilitate its role as the ultimate pivot. Other top-tier users include **Rillaboom**, **Iron Hands**, and **Grimmsnarl**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon like **Weavile** (Ice/Dark) and **Mienshao** (Fighting) to provide immediate pressure and safely scout the opponent's item or speed tier. 
* **Acquisition:** While it was not a TM/TR for many years, it became a TM in Generation IX, significantly increasing its accessibility for many Physical attackers. Traditionally, it was a highly sought-after **Egg Move** for many competitive archetypes.
