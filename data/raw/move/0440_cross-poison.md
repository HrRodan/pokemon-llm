## Identity & Mechanics
**Cross Poison** is a physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user delivers a high-speed, precision slashing attack in a cross-shaped pattern using venomous claws, blades, or stingers. This jagged strike is designed to puncture vital points, making it highly effective at bypassing defensive positioning to land critical hits while simultaneously secreting toxins into the target's bloodstream.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage).
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to leave the target with the Poison status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Crit-Based Physical STAB / Reliability Option.
* **Usage:** While it has lower raw power than *Poison Jab* (80 BP) or the devastating *Gunk Shot* (120 BP), Cross Poison is favored by Pokémon that utilize the **Sniper** ability or high-crit builds (e.g., Scope Lens sets). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types, making it a vital tool for checking prominent Fairy-type walls. 
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Its "slashing" nature allows it to benefit from the **Sharpness** ability in recent generations.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (37 total learners), primarily found among predatory insects, bats, and toxic brawlers.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Drapion** (who leverages the *Sniper* ability for massive critical damage), **Crobat**, and **Toxicroak**. It is also a signature-style move for the Legendary Pokémon **Eternatus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon such as **Scizor**, **Scyther**, and **Gliscor** to provide vital coverage against Fairy-type switch-ins that otherwise resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** It has historically been an Egg Move or level-up move, but it gained wider accessibility as a **TR (TR73)** in Generation VIII.
