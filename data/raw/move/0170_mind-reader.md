## Identity & Mechanics
**Mind-Reader** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user senses the target's inner thoughts and movements, predicting their every action to ensure total synchronization. By sharpening its mental focus, the user eliminates any chance of the opponent evading the subsequent strike. This move is functionally identical to the Steel-type move *Lock-On*.
* **Effect:** After using Mind-Reader, the very next move the user directs at the same target is guaranteed to hit, regardless of accuracy or evasion modifiers. This effect allows the user to strike Pokémon in semi-invulnerable states (such as those using **Dig**, **Fly**, or **Dive**). While it does not perfectly bypass **Protect** or **Detect**, it grants a small mathematical chance to break through based on the accuracy of the following move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the "Mind-Reader" status condition can be transferred to a teammate via **Baton Pass**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Ignores Accuracy/Evasion), PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Gimmick Accuracy Support / OHKO Setup.
* **Usage:** Mind-Reader is primarily utilized in "Sure-Hit" strategies to bypass the low accuracy of devastating moves. Its most infamous application is the **Mind-Reader + Sheer Cold** combo, which guarantees a One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) if the user is at a higher or equal level than the target. Outside of OHKO gimmicks, it is rarely seen in high-level competitive play because it takes two turns to execute one attack, often resulting in a loss of momentum or allowing the opponent to switch out to reset the effect. It deals **Neutral** utility to all types but is blocked by Pokémon with the **Soundproof** ability in some specific mechanical contexts (though technically not a sound move).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; fails if the target switches out.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (24 total learners), primarily found among Pokémon with heightened sensory or psychic themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Articuno** (and **Articuno-Galar**) to facilitate guaranteed **Sheer Cold** or **Blizzard**. It is also a signature-style move for **Poliwrath**, **Breloom**, and **Medicham**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Fighting-types like **Poliwrath** or **Hitmonlee** to ensure a hit with the high-damage but low-accuracy **Dynamic Punch**, guaranteeing a Confusion proc alongside heavy damage.
* **Acquisition:** Generally limited to Level-up learning or Egg Moves; it is not available as a TM or TR in recent generations, making its distribution strictly native to specific evolutionary lines.
