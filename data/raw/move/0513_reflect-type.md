## Identity & Mechanics
**Reflect Type** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user reflects the target’s elemental essence, undergoing a molecular shift to perfectly mimic the opponent's current typing. This allows the user to adapt dynamically to the battlefield, gaining the defensive resistances and offensive STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) of the Pokémon it is facing.
* **Effect:** The user's typing is permanently changed to match the target's current typing for as long as the user remains active on the field. This includes dual-typing.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. This move bypasses accuracy checks (it cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Anti-Meta Counter-play.
* **Usage:** Reflect Type is a niche tactical tool used primarily to flip the script on offensive threats. By copying the type of a "check" or "counter," the user often gains resistances to the opponent's primary attacks. For example, a Psychic-type using this on a Steel-type suddenly gains a resistance to the Steel and Dark moves that would otherwise threaten it. It is distinct from moves like *Conversion* or *Camouflage* because it is reactive and depends entirely on the opponent's composition.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it deals no direct damage. However, it allows the user to gain **Super Effective** coverage using the target's own STAB types against future opponents or the target itself if the target is weak to its own type (e.g., Dragon or Ghost).
* **Attributes:** This move is not blocked by *Protect* or *Detect* in certain generations, and it can be reflected by *Magic Coat*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow and exclusive distribution, learned by only 15 Pokémon across all generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably utilized by **Latias** (and Mega Latias), **Mew**, and **Gengar**. Latias frequently uses it in competitive singles to shed its weaknesses to Pursuit and Dragon-type moves by copying the typing of an incoming Steel-type or Fairy-type.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Tentacruel** and **Starmie** (via Staryu) to provide unique defensive pivoting options, allowing them to wall attackers they would normally be weak to. **Stunfisk (Galarian)** also utilizes it to leverage its unique Ground/Steel base before shifting.
* **Acquisition:** Reflect Type is not a TM or TR move; it is almost exclusively learned through **Level Up** or as an **Egg Move**, making its presence on a team a deliberate and often surprising teambuilding choice.
