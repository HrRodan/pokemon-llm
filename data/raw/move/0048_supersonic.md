## Identity & Mechanics
**Supersonic** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user emits high-frequency, ultrasonic sound waves that resonate at a pitch undetectable to the human ear but devastating to a Pokémon's equilibrium. This acoustic assault disorients the target, clouding their focus and inducing a state of deep confusion. As a **Sound-based move**, it interacts specifically with certain abilities and can bypass substitutes in modern generations.
* **Effect:** Causes the target to become **Confused**. While confused, the target has a 33% chance (in Gen VII+) to hurt itself with a 40-power physical Typeless attack instead of executing its intended move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the status condition).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 55%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Low-Accuracy Disruption / Niche Utility.
* **Usage:** Supersonic is generally considered a high-risk, low-reward option. In competitive play, it is almost entirely outclassed by **Confuse Ray**, which has 100% accuracy, or **Swagger**, which has 85% accuracy. Its primary use case is in early-game "nuisance" strategies or on Pokémon that lack better disruption options. It deals **Neutral** utility to all types, but as a sound move, it is completely negated by the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute; blocked by Soundproof). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (83 learners), primarily among bat-like, aquatic, or mechanical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic on the **Zubat line (Zubat, Golbat, Crobat)**, **Tentacruel**, and the **Magnemite line**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on heavy-hitters like **Swampert**, **Noivern**, and **Exploud** as a thematic disruption tool, though it is rarely chosen over more reliable offensive or setup moves.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up. It is notably absent from the TM/TR lists of recent generations, making it a "natural" move for specific biological archetypes (bats, birds, and sea creatures).
