## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Mid-tier Coverage / Utility Biting Move.
* **Usage:** Thunder Fang is often chosen by physical attackers who lack access to the stronger *Wild Charge* or wish to avoid its recoil damage. While its base power is modest, it is categorized as a **Biting Move**, meaning its power is increased by 50% (to 97.5) when used by Pokémon with the **Strong Jaw** ability. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is affected by abilities or items that trigger upon touch (like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet). It also benefits from any "Strong Jaw" or "Fang" related modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (119 learners), primarily found among predatory or beast-like Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) by **Luxray**, **Manectric**, and **Boltund** (who maximizes its damage via Strong Jaw). It is also a signature part of the movesets for legendary beasts like **Raikou**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on high-tier physical threats like **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, **Salamence**, and **Zacian-Crowned**. These Pokémon use it as a reliable coverage option to hit Water-type walls or Flying-type mirrors that would otherwise resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** It is highly accessible, appearing as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in both the Galar (Sword/Shield) and Paldea (Scarlet/Violet) regions.
