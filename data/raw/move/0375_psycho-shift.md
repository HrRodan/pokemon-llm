## Identity & Mechanics
**Psycho Shift** is a **Status Psychic-type** move introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** The user employs powerful psychic suggestion and mental projection to transplant its own physiological ailments onto the opponent. This move effectively "cures" the user by forcing its current status condition—such as a Burn, Paralysis, or Poison—directly onto the target's body through telepathic displacement.
* **Effect:** If the user is currently afflicted by a major status condition (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep) and the target is not, the user's status condition is removed and simultaneously inflicted upon the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The move's primary function is the status transfer itself).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Utility / Status Control.**
* **Usage:** Psycho Shift is primarily used in specialized "Orb" strategies. A Pokémon holding a **Flame Orb** or **Toxic Orb** can intentionally trigger a status condition on themselves to activate abilities (like Marvel Scale) or prevent other statuses, then use Psycho Shift to "pass" that detrimental burn or poison to an opponent, effectively crippling physical attackers or stalling walls. While it provides a 100% accurate way to inflict status, it is risky and requires the user to be status-afflicted first. It is blocked by **Dark-type** Pokémon due to their immunity to Psychic-type moves.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal direct damage, but as a Psychic move, it cannot affect **Dark-type** targets.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Magic Coat** in some generations but is generally reflected; does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (21 total learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic and Bird-like Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Sigilyph** (which synergizes perfectly with its *Magic Guard* ability to avoid Orb damage), **Cresselia**, and **Latias/Latios**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Noctowl** or **Galarian Articuno** as a niche utility option to punish opponents who attempt to status them, or to bridge the gap between defensive utility and offensive pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available via **Egg Move** or **Move Tutor** (notably in Gen IV and Gen VI/VII), and is occasionally found as a specialized technical move for Psychic types. It is not a standard TM.
