## Identity & Mechanics
**Air Slash** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user manipulates atmospheric pressure to create a razor-sharp blade of compressed air, launching it with enough velocity to slice even the sky itself. This rapid, gust-based strike often disorients the opponent, potentially preventing them from acting.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and possesses a significant chance to cause the target to flinch.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to Flinch the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Utility (Flinch-hax).
* **Usage:** Air Slash is the gold standard for Special-attacking Flying types who value consistency over the raw power and low accuracy of *Hurricane*. It is most famously paired with the Ability **Serene Grace**, which doubles the flinch chance to 60%, creating a "Para-Flinch" strategy when the opponent is paralyzed. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is classified as a **Slicing** move in later generations, receiving a 1.5x damage boost from the Ability **Sharpness**. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (168 learners), serving as the primary Special Flying STAB for a vast majority of avian and elemental Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Togekiss** (the premier Serene Grace flinch-trapper), **Charizard** (reliable Special STAB), and **Shaymin-Sky**, which uses its high speed to effectively shut down opponents via flinching.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Flying Pokémon like **Volcarona**, **Sigilyph**, and **Iron Moth** to provide essential coverage against Fighting and Bug-type threats that might otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in most modern generations, including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet.
