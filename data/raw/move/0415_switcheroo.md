## Identity & Mechanics
**Switcheroo** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user performs a high-speed sleight-of-hand maneuver, trading its held item with the opponent's faster than the eye can follow. This deceptive tactic is designed to disrupt the opponent's strategy by stealing their vital equipment while burdening them with a detrimental or useless item.
* **Effect:** The user and the target permanently swap held items. The move succeeds even if one participant is not holding an item. However, it fails if either Pokémon is holding Mail, or possesses the abilities **Multitype** (Arceus) or **Sticky Hold**. Items cannot be recovered via Recycle after a swap.
* **Secondary Effect:** If a Pokémon receives a **Choice item** (Band, Scarf, or Specs) via Switcheroo after it has already moved that turn, the move it just performed becomes its locked Choice move. 
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility / Disruptor / Choice-Lock Strategy.
* **Usage:** Switcheroo is the Dark-type equivalent to the move **Trick**. It is primarily used by "Choice-item Tricksters" to cripple defensive walls (like Blissey or Toxapex) by forcing a Choice Scarf or Choice Band onto them, effectively neutralizing their ability to use diverse utility moves. It also serves as a way to reclaim a lost advantage by stealing a Life Orb or Leftovers from an opponent.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage. However, as a Dark-type move, it is blocked by the ability **Good as Gold** and, starting in Gen VII, fails against Dark-type targets if used by a Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails against targets behind a Substitute (in most generations) or protected by Crafty Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), primarily found among mischievous, fast, or Dark-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely utilized by **Whimsicott** and **Klefki** (who benefit from the Prankster ability to swap items with priority), as well as **Infernape** and **Greninja**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Linoone** or **Persian-Alola** to disrupt specialized sets or to unload a "junk" item (like a used-up Berry or a Choice item) onto a physical or special sweeper.
* **Acquisition:** Unlike Trick, which is a common TM/Tutor move, Switcheroo is rarely a TM and is usually learned via level-up or Egg Moves, making its distribution more niche than its Psychic-type counterpart.
