## Identity & Mechanics
**Recover** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy or cellular structure to rapidly regenerate damaged tissue and restore vitality. This move is a cornerstone of defensive play, representing a Pokémon's ability to mend wounds instantly during combat to maintain longevity against sustained assaults.
* **Effect:** Heals the user for 50% of its maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Utility / Sustain.
* **Usage:** Recover is considered the gold standard for reliable healing. In competitive formats, it is the lifeblood of **Stall** and **Balance** archetypes, allowing defensive walls to negate damage taken from "chip" or entry hazards. Unlike *Rest*, it does not induce sleep, and unlike *Roost*, it does not temporarily remove the user's Flying-type resistances. However, in Generation IX, its PP was significantly reduced to 5, making it more susceptible to **Pressure** stalling and long-term depletion. It is primarily used to check offensive threats by out-lasting their limited high-power move PP.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; blocked by **Taunt**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (80 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic, Water, and high-bulk Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include the legendary **Mewtwo** and **Lugia** (who utilizes it to reset its *Multiscale* ability), as well as defensive stalwarts like **Toxapex**, **Gastrodon**, and **Alakazam**.
* **Utility Users:** Frequently seen on modern meta-threats like **Gholdengo** and **Garganacl** to transform them into "unbreakable" late-game win conditions. It is also a staple on **Porygon2** when equipped with Eviolite.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up; it is rarely available as a TM/TR in recent generations, making it a "privileged" move for specific defensive archetypes.
