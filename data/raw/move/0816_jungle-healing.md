## Identity & Mechanics
**Jungle Healing** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user taps into deep botanical energy and becomes one with the natural jungle environment. It releases a wave of restorative power that wraps around the user and its allies in mystical vines, purifying their bodies of toxins and closing wounds. This move is a powerful "cleric" tool that combines health regeneration with status cleansing.
* **Effect:** Restores **25% of the maximum HP** of the user and all active ally Pokémon. Additionally, it **cures any non-volatile status conditions** (Burn, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, and Freeze) affecting the user and its allies.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The healing and curing are primary effects).
* **Targeting:** User and Allies (Spread support).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Sustain / Cleric.
* **Usage:** Jungle Healing is an incredibly efficient support move, acting as a superior hybrid of *Life Dew* and *Heal Bell/Aromatherapy*. In Double Battles (VGC), it provides massive value by keeping a teammate healthy and clearing crippling status effects like Burn on physical attackers or Paralysis on speed-reliant sweepers. While it does not deal damage, it counters **Status-heavy** team compositions and provides **Super Effective** defensive utility against stall tactics.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses Protect if used by an ally in some contexts, but generally targets the user's side of the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the **Signature Move** of the Mythical Pokémon Zarude.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Zarude** and its alternate form, **Zarude-Dada**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a Signature Move, it is not seen as coverage on other Pokémon. However, it allows Zarude to function as a "Bulky Pivot" or "Support Tank," keeping itself and its teammates alive while threatening opponents with its high Attack stat.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; Zarude learns this move naturally upon reaching Level 90.
