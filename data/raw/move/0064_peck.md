## Identity & Mechanics
**Peck** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user delivers a quick, sharp strike by jabbing the target with a beak, horn, or pointed snout. This move represents a basic aerial assault, utilizing the Pokémon's natural anatomy to inflict contact-based damage. It is a fundamental avian maneuver characterized by its simplicity and precision.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target. It lacks any additional utility or complex mechanics, functioning as a straightforward offensive tool.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for status or stat changes).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** Peck is almost exclusively used during the early stages of a playthrough. In competitive formats, it is strictly outclassed by more powerful Flying-type options such as **Drill Peck**, **Brave Bird**, or **Dual Wingbeat**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass**, **Fighting**, and **Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or Iron Barbs and is affected by items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, with **88** different Pokémon capable of learning it through natural growth or evolution.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic early-game birds like **Fearow**, **Corviknight**, and **Talonflame** rely on this move for initial training. It is also a staple for bird-like starters such as **Blaziken**, **Empoleon**, and **Decidueye**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Interestingly, Peck is learned by several non-Flying Pokémon that possess sharp appendages, such as **Nidoking**, **Seaking**, and **Mamoswine**. In the early game, these Pokémon can use Peck to bypass defensive Bug or Grass types before they gain access to their primary Ground or Water STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Peck is almost universally learned via **Level Up**. It has historically never been available as a **TM or TR**, making it an innate "natural" move for Pokémon with pointed features.
