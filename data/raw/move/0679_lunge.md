## Identity & Mechanics
**Lunge** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** The user propels its entire body forward in a sudden, violent thrust to strike the target with maximum momentum. This aggressive maneuver is designed to overwhelm the opponent, jarring them so severely that their physical combat prowess is diminished.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and provides a guaranteed debuff to the opponent's offensive capabilities.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s Attack stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility Attacker / Defensive Debuffer.
* **Usage:** Lunge is a highly efficient "Consistency Option" for physical Bug types. It is often preferred over X-Scissor because it shares the same base power but includes a guaranteed secondary effect. In competitive play, it is used to "soften" physical wallbreakers, allowing the user or a teammate to survive incoming hits. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (83 learners), primarily found among arthropod-based Pokémon and aggressive physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Buzzwole**, **Pheromosa**, **Araquanid**, and **Centiskorch**. It is also a staple for the Generation IX threat **Lokix**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Surprisingly learned by non-Bug types like **Heatran**, **Toxapex**, and **Malamar**. On defensive Pokémon like Toxapex, it serves as a niche tool to neuter physical attackers on the switch.
* **Acquisition:** While it originated as a level-up move for many Bug-types, it is widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
