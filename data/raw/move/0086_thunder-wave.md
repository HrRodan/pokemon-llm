## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunder Wave** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user launches a weak but precise jolt of electricity that overloads the target's nervous system. This low-voltage discharge is designed not to cause physical damage but to disrupt motor functions, leaving the opponent twitching and immobile.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Paralysis** status condition on the target. Paralysis reduces the target's Speed by 50% and grants a 25% chance for the target to be "fully paralyzed," preventing it from moving that turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to inflict status, barring accuracy/immunities).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 90%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Speed Control / Utility.
* **Usage:** Thunder Wave is a cornerstone of competitive play, acting as the premier form of **Speed Control**. By halving an opponent's speed, it allows slower "Wallbreakers" to outspeed and "Check" faster threats. It is often paired with flinch-inducing moves (like Iron Head or Air Slash) to create the notorious **"Para-flinch"** strategy, significantly reducing the opponent's odds of successfully attacking. It is ineffective against **Ground-type** Pokémon and, since Generation VI, **Electric-type** Pokémon are also immune.
* **Comparison:** While **Glare** has 100% accuracy and hits Ground-types, its distribution is much narrower. **Nuzzle** is preferred on certain Pokémon as it deals chip damage and bypasses *Taunt*, but has lower distribution than the universal Thunder Wave.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Magic Coat" in certain generations; blocked by "Substitute" and "Limber" ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (358 learners), making it one of the most common utility moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Pikachu** and **Raichu**, but heavily utilized by defensive stalwarts like **Blissey**, **Ferrothorn**, and **Clefable** to punish fast switch-ins.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon such as **Gyarados**, **Dragonite**, and **Togekiss** to compensate for their middling speed tiers or to support the team.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has been available as **TM45**, **TM73**, or **TR08** across almost every generation, including the Kanto, Galar, and Paldea regions.
