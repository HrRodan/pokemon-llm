## Identity & Mechanics
**Synchronoise** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user releases an odd, resonating shock wave that vibrates at a frequency matching its own biological and elemental makeup. This psychic pulse permeates the battlefield, only dealing damage to targets that share at least one elemental type with the user.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage to all adjacent Pokémon that share a type with the user. If the target does not share a type with the user, the move fails to deal damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Spread move in Doubles/Triples, though restricted by the type-matching mechanic).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Niche Mirror-Match Counter.
* **Usage:** While boasting a massive 120 Base Power (rivaling Hydro Pump or Moonblast), Synchronoise is considered highly situational and generally unviable in standard competitive play due to its restrictive mechanic. It is primarily used in **Mirror Matches** or by dual-type Pokémon to snag surprise KOs on specific threats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types (when used by a Psychic-type user against a target of the same type).
* **Attributes:** This is a Sound-based move in later generations, meaning it bypasses *Substitute* but is blocked by the *Soundproof* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (22 total learners), primarily found among Psychic types and certain Normal-type "sound-themed" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with **Sigilyph**, **Beheeyem**, and **Noctowl**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** In rare niche scenarios, it is seen on **Exploud** or **Chatot** (Normal types) to hit other Normal types in lower-tier formats, though it fails to hit anything for super-effective damage in those cases. **Magearna** also has access to it, though it rarely opts for it over more reliable Fairy or Steel STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Synchronoise is not a TM/TR move and is exclusively learned via Level Up or Egg Move by a select group of Pokémon. Notably, the move was removed from the movepool of most Pokémon in Generation VIII and beyond.
