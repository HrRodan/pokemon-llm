## Identity & Mechanics
**Frenzy Plant** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user summons a massive, tangled thicket of enormous roots and thorny vines from the earth to violently thrash the target. This overwhelming display of natural force is so taxing that it leaves the user completely exhausted and unable to act momentarily.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. However, the user must spend the next turn "recharging," during which it cannot attack, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The recharge turn is a mandatory negative mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Frenzy Plant is the Grass-type equivalent of *Hyper Beam* or *Blast Burn*. In competitive play, it is generally considered a high-risk option because the recharge turn allows the opponent a "free turn" to set up or switch in a counter. It is often compared to **Leaf Storm**; while Leaf Storm lowers Special Attack, it allows the user to switch out, making it the more flexible choice. Frenzy Plant is most effectively used as a final finishing move or as a base for a powerful **Z-Move (Bloom Doom)** or **Max Move (Max Overgrowth)** to bypass the recharge penalty. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by Iron Barbs or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow and exclusive distribution (13 total learners), limited almost entirely to **Grass-type Starter Pokémon** through specialized Move Tutors.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Venusaur**, **Sceptile** (who can leverage its high Special Attack), and **Serperior**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While primarily a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for starters, the Mythical Pokémon **Mew** can learn it, though it rarely runs it over more flexible coverage options. Modern starters like **Meowscarada** and **Rillaboom** also have access, though they often prefer physical moves.
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught by an "Ultimate Move" Tutor in various regions (e.g., Cape Brink in Kanto, Route 228 in Sinnoh). In the most recent generations (Scarlet/Violet), it has been modernized as a **TM** available in the late game or via the Indigo Disk DLC.
