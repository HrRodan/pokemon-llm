## Identity & Mechanics
**Searing Shot** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user releases a devastating inferno of scarlet flames that radiates outward, torching everything in the immediate vicinity. This intense combustion generates enough heat to melt steel and leave opponents scorched. It is visually characterized by a massive explosion of red and orange energy emanating from the user.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent special damage to all adjacent targets. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a high **30% chance** to inflict a **Burn** on each target hit.
* **Targeting:** **Spread Move** (Targets all other Pokémon in Double or Triple Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Premium STAB / Spread Attacker.**
* **Usage:** Searing Shot is one of the most efficient Fire-type moves in the game. It serves as a direct upgrade to *Flamethrower* (90 Power, 10% Burn) and a more reliable alternative to *Fire Blast* (110 Power, 85% Accuracy). Its 30% burn rate is comparable to *Scald*, making it a significant defensive threat that can cripple physical attackers. In doubles, it acts as a powerful spread move, though it requires a teammate with *Protect* or the *Flash Fire* ability to avoid friendly fire.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Steel, Grass, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **non-contact** and does not bypass substitutes unless the user has specific abilities (e.g., Infiltrator, though the primary user does not).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, being the **Signature Move** of a single Mythical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Victini**. It is often paired with Victini’s *Victory Star* ability to ensure it never misses, even under accuracy-lowering conditions.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to Victini, it is not seen as coverage on other types. On Victini, it provides a more reliable Fire-type STAB than *V-create* when a player wants to avoid the defensive stat drops associated with the latter.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned naturally by Victini at Level 1 (or via Move Reminder).
