## Identity & Mechanics
**Freeze-Dry** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user rapidly cools the target to absolute zero, causing internal moisture to crystallize instantly. This specialized thermal shock is designed to compromise the cellular structure of even aquatic organisms, making it uniquely devastating against those typically resistant to cold.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. In a unique mechanical exception, this move deals **Super Effective** damage against **Water-type** Pokémon. This effect persists even if the move's type is changed via abilities like Pixilate or Galvanize.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to leave the target Frozen.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Precision Coverage / Anti-Meta Utility.
* **Usage:** While it has lower raw power than *Ice Beam* (90) or *Blizzard* (110), Freeze-Dry is considered one of the most valuable moves in competitive play. It provides perfect "role compression" by allowing an Ice-type to hit **Water/Ground** (Swampert, Quagsire), **Water/Flying** (Pelipper, Gyarados), and **Water/Dragon** (Dracovish, Kingdra) types for 4x damage—targets that usually wall Ice-types.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ground, Flying, Dragon,** and **Water** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not blocked by Bulletproof or Sound-based interactions.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (26 total learners), primarily restricted to pure or primary Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Iron Bundle** (where it is a staple STAB move), **Kyurem** (all forms), and **Articuno**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically vital for **Lapras** and **Aurorus** to win "mirror matches" against other Water-types. It is a signature tactical choice for **Mamoswine** to punish physical walls like Rotom-Wash.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned through leveling up or as an Egg Move; it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its presence on a team predictable but difficult to switch into.
