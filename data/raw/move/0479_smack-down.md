## Identity & Mechanics
**Smack Down** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user hurls a heavy stone or projectile at the target with enough force to knock airborne entities out of the sky. This move is specifically designed to ground opponents, forcing them to interact with the battlefield's surface regardless of their natural biology or magical elevation.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and grounds the target. This removes any Ground-type immunity provided by the **Flying type**, the **Levitate** ability, or moves like **Magnet Rise** and **Telekinesis**. It also immediately cancels the semi-invulnerable state of moves like **Fly** or **Bounce**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the "Grounded" status upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Tech Move (Ground-Immunity Breaker).
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Smack Down is a specialized "lure" or setup tool. It is primarily used to bypass the "EdgeQuake" (Stone Edge + Earthquake) resistance. By grounding a Flying-type or Levitate user (like Corviknight or Rotom-Wash), the user can follow up with a devastating STAB Earthquake on the next turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Considered a **Projectile** move (blocked by Bulletproof).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (186 learners), making it a common utility option for Physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on **Landorus-Therian**, **Tyranitar**, and **Gigalith** to deal with airborne checks. It is also a staple for **Primal Groudon** in restricted formats to ensure its Ground-type moves hit everything.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally carried by non-Rock types like **Greninja**, **Toxapex**, and **Inteleon** as a niche tech choice to punish switch-ins from Flying-type walls or to disrupt opponents using Fly/Bounce in VGC.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible; it has functioned as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in almost every generation since its debut (TM23 in Gen 5-7, TM179 in Gen 9).
