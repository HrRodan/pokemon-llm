## Identity & Mechanics
**Waterfall** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user charges at the target with the momentum of a massive crashing wave, slamming into them with immense hydraulic force. This move is synonymous with aquatic power and vertical movement, often depicted as the user swimming up or falling down with great speed to crush the opponent.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular physical damage. It is a contact-making move.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20% chance** to make the target **Flinch**, preventing them from moving if the user attacks first.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.**
* **Usage:** For most of competitive history, Waterfall served as the premier Physical Water-type STAB move due to its perfect accuracy and flinch chance. While it has recently seen competition from *Liquidation* (which has 85 power and a Defense drop chance), Waterfall remains a staple for Pokémon that prioritize the flinch chance or lack access to Liquidation. It is particularly potent on **Dragon Dance** or **Choice Scarf** users who can outspeed opponents to fishing for "flinch-hax."
* **Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (171 learners), traditionally serving as a core utility move for traversal (HM07) and combat.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to Physical Water-type threats such as **Gyarados**, **Feraligatr** (which benefits from Sheer Force removing the flinch chance for a power boost), **Swampert**, and **Azumarill** (utilizing Huge Power).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently carried by Dragon-types like **Dragonite** and **Rayquaza**, or diverse Physical attackers like **Arceus**, to provide reliable coverage against Ground and Fire types.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has functioned as **HM07** in most early regions and remains a widely available **TM/TR** in modern titles (e.g., TM058 in SV).
