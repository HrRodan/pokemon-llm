## Identity & Mechanics
**Bug Bite** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user attacks by sinking its mandibles into the target for a sharp nip. This predatory strike allows the user to scavenge resources; if the target is holding a Berry, the user plucks it away and consumes it immediately, gaining its nutritional or defensive benefits while depriving the opponent of their held item.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is holding a Berry, the user steals and consumes it immediately. In some mechanical iterations, the move's power is doubled when the target holds a Berry. It bypasses the usual consumption triggers of the opponent.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **Steal/Consume** the target's Berry.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility STAB / Technician-Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Bug Bite is the premier choice for Pokémon with the **Technician** ability, as its base 60 power is boosted to 90, making it stronger and more functional than *X-Scissor*. Beyond raw damage, it serves as vital **Item Disruption**, neutralizing defensive threats that rely on Sitrus Berries or offensive threats using Liechi/Salac Berries. It is often weighed against *U-turn* (for pivoting) or *Leech Life* (for recovery). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Effect Spore.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (114 learners), primarily found among Bug-types and reptilian/insectoid predators.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Scizor** (the most famous Technician abuser), **Mega Beedrill**, **Kleavor**, and **Lokix**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Surprisingly utilized by non-Bug Pokémon such as **Heatran**, **Flygon**, and **Gliscor** in specific formats or historical Tutors to provide coverage against Grass or Psychic types while providing resource denial.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **Move Tutor** in earlier generations (like HGSS/B2W2) and as a **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
