## Identity & Mechanics
**Hold Hands** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user reaches out to an adjacent ally to join hands, creating a heartwarming moment of camaraderie that makes both Pokémon feel very happy. While visually and thematically focused on the bond between teammates, the move has no direct impact on HP or status conditions in standard play.
* **Effect:** Theoretically "does nothing" during a standard turn; it provides no buffs, heals, or damage. Its primary function is aesthetic and symbolic.
* **Secondary Effect:** 0% (No secondary effects).
* **Targeting:** Adjacent Ally (Double/Triple Battles only).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Gimmick / Z-Move Setup.
* **Usage:** In standard Generation VI play, Hold Hands is entirely non-competitive. However, its value shifted dramatically in Generation VII with the introduction of **Z-Moves**. When powered up by a **Normalium Z**, it becomes **Z-Hold Hands**, which grants the user an **"Omniboost"**—increasing Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each. In this context, it acts as a high-tier setup move for event-exclusive sweepers.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage and therefore has no Super Effective profile.
* **Attributes:** This move is not affected by King's Rock and cannot be used if the user is under the effect of Taunt.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is an **Event-Exclusive** move (0 natural learners in standard gameplay).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily associated with **Fancy Pattern Vivillon** (which debuted the move to celebrate the Pokémon GTS), **Pikachu**, and **Hoopa**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on event distributions of **Charizard** and **Eevee**. On these Pokémon, it serves as a trophy move rather than a tactical coverage option.
* **Acquisition:** It is never available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It can only be obtained on specific Pokémon distributed through official Nintendo events in Cherish Balls.
