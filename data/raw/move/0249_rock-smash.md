## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Smash** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user delivers a powerful, blunt strike designed to shatter hard surfaces. While primarily known as a field utility for clearing boulders and obstacles in the overworld, in battle, it manifests as a concussive blow that weakens the opponent's physical fortitude.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a high probability of compromising the target's armor.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s **Defense** stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Early-game Progression / Niche Utility. 
* **Usage:** In standard competitive play, Rock Smash is generally outclassed by high-damage options like **Close Combat** or reliable utility moves like **Drain Punch**. However, it possesses a niche in lower tiers or specific "Technician" ability sets (such as **Scizor** or **Breloom**), where its base power is boosted to 60, making it a low-stakes fishing tool for Defense drops. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (507 learners), largely due to its historical status as an **HM (Hidden Machine)** move required for map navigation.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fighting-type specialists like **Machamp**, **Lucario**, and **Conkeldurr** naturally learn or utilize it during early training. It is also found in the movepools of powerful Legendaries like **Groudon**, **Dialga**, and **Koraidon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on a vast array of non-Fighting Pokémon such as **Tyranitar**, **Aggron**, and **Snorlax** to provide early-game coverage against Steel and Rock types.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM or HM** across almost every generation, making it one of the most accessible moves in the franchise's history. Throughout many regions (Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh), it was a mandatory field move for progression.
