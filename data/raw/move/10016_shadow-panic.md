## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Panic** is a Status **Shadow**-type move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically for the GameCube title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user emanates a localized, terrifying aura of dark, shadowy energy that overwhelms the minds of the opposition. This wave of negative energy induces intense fear and mental distress, leaving targets disoriented and prone to hurting themselves in their delirium.
* **Effect:** Confuses the target. In the context of the Shadow-type mechanics, it deals **Super Effective** damage/effects to all non-Shadow Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Guaranteed confusion on hit).
* **Targeting:** **Opponents' Field** (Hits both opposing Pokémon in a Double Battle).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 90%, PP [N/A].
* **Role:** **AOE Crowd Control** / **Utility**.
* **Usage:** Shadow Panic functions as a Shadow-type version of moves like *Confuse Ray* or *Supersonic*, but with a significantly higher impact due to its ability to hit multiple targets simultaneously. In *Pokémon XD*, where Double Battles are the standard, this move serves as a powerful disruptive tool to stall opponents and force "self-hit" RNG. Unlike standard Status moves, as a Shadow move, it is inherently "Super Effective" against any non-Shadow Pokémon, though this primarily affects damage-dealing Shadow moves rather than status-only ones.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many traditional type-based immunities common in Gen III (since Shadow is a unique category).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, restricted exclusively to "Shadow Pokémon" within the Orre Region.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily used by **Shadow Ursaring**, **Shadow Hypno**, and **Shadow Hitmonlee** during the events of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Cannot be used by standard Pokémon; it is a temporary move that is lost and replaced once the Pokémon undergoes **Purification**. 
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Breeding. It is hard-coded into the movesets of specific Shadow Pokémon captured from Cipher Peons or Admins.
