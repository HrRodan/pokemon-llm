## Identity & Mechanics
**Shore Up** is a Status Ground-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user pulls in sand and earth from the surrounding environment to reinforce its structure and "shore up" its defenses, regaining vital energy. This move is thematically linked to coastal and desert terrains, utilizing granular materials to repair the user's body.
* **Effect:** The user regains up to 1/2 (50%) of its maximum HP. Under the effects of a **Sandstorm**, the recovery is increased to 2/3 (approximately 66.7%) of the user's maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable Recovery / Defensive Sustainability.
* **Usage:** Shore Up is a premium recovery move, functioning as a direct upgrade to *Recover* or *Slack Off* when utilized on Sandstorm-based teams. Unlike *Synthesis*, *Moonlight*, or *Morning Sun*—which are hindered by non-ideal weather—Shore Up is uniquely **buffed by Sandstorm**, making it the gold standard for healing in weather-centric defensive cores. It allows the user to act as a formidable **Wall**, stalling out opponents and outlasting damage through attrition.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Can be reflected by *Magic Coat* or stolen by *Snatch*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 total learners), serving as the signature recovery method for the Sandygast evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Palossand** and **Sandygast**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to the Palossand line, it is rarely seen outside of Ghost/Ground defensive builds. Its existence makes Palossand a niche but effective counter to physical attackers in lower competitive tiers, especially when paired with the **Sand Stream** ability from teammates like Tyranitar or Hippowdon to trigger the 66% healing threshold.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is strictly a level-up move for its specific users.
