## Identity & Mechanics
**Psybeam** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user fires a peculiar, multicolored ray of telekinetic energy at the target. This beam of psychic force vibrates at a frequency designed to disrupt the target's neural pathways, potentially leaving them disoriented.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to induce the **Confusion** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Progression STAB.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Psybeam is generally considered a "transitional" move. It is almost universally outclassed by **Psychic** (90 BP) for raw damage or **Psyshock** (80 BP) for targeting physical defense. Its primary niche is in lower-tier formats or during the mid-game of a playthrough where its high PP and perfect accuracy provide reliable chip damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses effects like Bulletproof; does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (147 learners), being a staple move for most Pokémon with telekinetic or supernatural themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by iconic Psychic-types such as **Alakazam**, **Espeon**, and **Gardevoir** during their growth phase before they access higher-tier Psychic attacks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Starmie**, **Venomoth**, and **Octillery**. For Bug and Poison types like Venomoth, it provides vital coverage against rival Poison-type threats. 
* **Acquisition:** While historically a level-up move, it has regained status as a **TM** in recent titles like *Scarlet & Violet*, making it easily accessible for early-game special attackers.
