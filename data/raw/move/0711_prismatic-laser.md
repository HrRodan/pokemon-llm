## Identity & Mechanics
**Prismatic Laser** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user, typically Necrozma, focuses its internal light through its crystalline body, refracting it into a devastating array of concentrated rainbow-colored beams. This intense release of energy utilizes the power of a prism to incinerate the target. Due to the sheer magnitude of power expended, the user experiences a momentary "blackout" or energy depletion.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. After using this move, the user must spend the next turn recharging, during which it cannot attack, use items, or switch out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to require a recharge turn).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 160, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Prismatic Laser is a Psychic-type "Hyper Beam" variant, but with a significantly higher base power (160 vs 150). While the recharge turn is a massive momentum drain that allows opponents to set up or switch safely, the move is used as a final-resort nuke to secure a KO on a defensive wall. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types. 
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, special beam attack. In Generation VII, it served as the base move for Ultra Necrozma's signature Z-Move, *Light That Burns the Sky*, which bypasses the recharge turn and calculates damage based on the higher of the user's Attack or Special Attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (4 total forms of a single Pokémon).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Necrozma**, as well as its fused forms **Necrozma-Dusk Mane** (Psychic/Steel) and **Necrozma-Dawn Wings** (Psychic/Ghost), and its ultimate form **Ultra Necrozma**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is exclusive to the Necrozma line, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. On Necrozma, it is often weighed against *Photon Geyser* (for flexibility) or *Psychic/Psyshock* (for consistency).
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned naturally by Necrozma at high levels.
