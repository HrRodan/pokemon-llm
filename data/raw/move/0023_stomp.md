## Identity & Mechanics
**Stomp** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user forcefully tramples the target underfoot, using its weight or hooves to crush the opponent. This physical assault is designed to overwhelm the foe, potentially leaving them too shaken to retaliate. In a unique mechanical interaction, this move deals significantly increased damage to targets that have attempted to evade attacks by shrinking with Minimize.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target has used Minimize, the power of Stomp is doubled to 130. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target flinch, preventing its move for the turn.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Flinch Utility.
* **Usage:** In early-to-mid-game progression, Stomp serves as a reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for many Physical attackers. In competitive play, it is generally outclassed by **Body Slam** (which offers a 30% Paralysis chance and higher base power) or **Return**. However, its 30% flinch rate makes it a niche tool for faster Pokémon looking to "flinch-lock" an opponent, and it serves as a hard counter to **Minimize** strategies often found in casual or specific restricted formats.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is **Resisted** by Rock and Steel types. It has **No Effect** on Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (71 learners), primarily found among equine, bovine, and heavy-footed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Rapidash**, **Tauros**, and **Miltank**, who utilize their hooves and weight for STAB damage. It is also a signature-style move for **Mudsdale** and **Copperajah**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon such as **Tyrantrum**, **Swampert**, and **Exeggutor**. These Pokémon often learn it via level-up to provide early-game physical pressure before more powerful specialized moves are available.
* **Acquisition:** Stomp is almost exclusively a **Level-up move**. It is rarely available via TM/TR, making its presence on a moveset a hallmark of a Pokémon's natural physical kit.
