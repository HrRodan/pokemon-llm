## Identity & Mechanics
**Ominous Wind** is a special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user summons a repulsive, ghastly gust of wind imbued with supernatural energy to strike the target. This spectral gale carries a cursed aura that has the potential to drastically empower the user, surrounding them in a dark shroud that enhances their physical and mystical capabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. It is part of the "Omniboost" family of moves (alongside Ancient Power and Silver Wind).
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to raise the user’s Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Low-Power Utility / Setup Fisher.
* **Usage:** Ominous Wind is rarely chosen for its raw damage, as it is significantly outclassed by **Shadow Ball** (80 BP) in terms of consistency and damage-per-second. Instead, it is used as a "high-variance" option in formats where a single "Omniboost" can turn a Pokémon into an unstoppable sweeper. Its extremely low PP (5) makes it a poor choice for long battles unless the secondary effect triggers early. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Classified as a **Wind-based move**; in newer generations, this allows it to interact with abilities like *Wind Power* or *Wind Rider*, and it is blocked by the move *Protect* but cannot be redirected by *Follow Me* in the same way certain physical contacts might.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (108 learners), primarily found among Ghost, Flying, and Bug types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Drifblim**, **Giratina**, and **Spiritomb**. Drifblim in particular is the most iconic user, often seen using the move in Sinnoh-based games.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Altaria**, **Dragonite**, and **Staraptor**. These Pokémon use it as a niche special coverage option or a desperate attempt to fish for a total stat boost to bypass their usual checks.
* **Acquisition:** While it appeared as a Move Tutor move in *Pokémon Platinum* and *HeartGold/SoulSilver*, its availability has fluctuated, often appearing as a natural level-up move for spectral or avian Pokémon. It is also a notable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for **Hisuian Zoroark** and **Hisuian Typhlosion**.
