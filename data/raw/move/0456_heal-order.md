## Identity & Mechanics
**Heal Order** is a Status Bug-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user, acting as a hive sovereign, issues a command to its colony. A swarm of underlings immediately surrounds the user, tending to its injuries and restoring its vitality. This thematic recovery move emphasizes the "Queen" archetype of the user, relying on a subservient swarm for battlefield longevity.
* **Effect:** Restores up to 50% of the user's maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable Recovery / Sustainability.
* **Usage:** Heal Order is functionally identical to moves like **Recover**, **Roost**, and **Slack Off**. It is the cornerstone of defensive sets, allowing the user to mitigate entry hazard damage (like Stealth Rock) and outlast opponents by "stalling" out their PP. While it provides excellent sustain, it does not provide the additional benefit of Roost (which temporarily removes the Flying-type's weaknesses), making the user purely reliant on its natural typing for the turn.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Signature Move**, exclusive to a specific evolutionary line. It is not affected by Mirror Move in certain generations but is susceptible to **Taunt** and **Heal Block**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Vespiquen**. 
* **Competitive Context:** On Vespiquen, Heal Order is usually paired with its sister moves, **Defend Order** and **Attack Order**, to create a "Boss Pokémon" strategy. In higher-tier play, it allows Vespiquen to utilize the **Pressure** ability effectively, forcing opponents to deplete their move PP while Vespiquen remains healthy.
* **Availability:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. Historically, it was removed from the move-pool in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield), where Vespiquen was forced to transition to **Roost** for its recovery needs, making Heal Order a legacy mechanic of the DS and 3DS eras.
