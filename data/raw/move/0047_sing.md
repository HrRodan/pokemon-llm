## Identity & Mechanics
**Sing** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user vocalizes a gentle, melodic lullaby or a soothing rhythmic chant. These sound waves resonate with the target, calming their nerves and inducing a deep, involuntary slumber. Because it is a sound-based move, it can vibrate through barriers to affect the target.
* **Effect:** Puts the target to **Sleep**. While asleep, the target cannot execute moves for 1–3 turns (depending on the generation's mechanics).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Non-adjacent in Triples).
* **Sound-Based Property:** This move bypasses **Substitute**, but is completely nullified by the **Soundproof** ability.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 55%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** High-Variance Utility / RNG Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Sing is widely considered a high-risk, high-reward option. In competitive play, it is generally outclassed by **Hypnosis** (60% accuracy) or **Sleep Powder** (75% accuracy). However, its niche lies in being a **Sound-based move**, allowing a user to inflict Sleep on a target hiding behind a **Substitute**, a feat other sleep-inducing moves (except Infiltrator-boosted ones) cannot achieve. It is often used as a "desperation play" or on defensive Pokémon that lack better status options.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it can affect **Ghost-types** despite being Normal-type. It is ineffective against Pokémon with **Insomnia**, **Vital Spirit**, **Comatose**, or those protected by **Electric Terrain** or **Misty Terrain**.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based (Bypasses Substitute; blocked by Soundproof).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (34 learners), typically restricted to Pokémon characterized by their singing voices or graceful natures.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Jigglypuff** and **Clefairy** lines. It is also a thematic staple for **Primarina**, **Altaria**, and **Lapadus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** In recent competitive circuits (Gen 9), **Skeledirge** and **Scream Tail** are notable users. Skeledirge can use Sing to neutralize threats it cannot immediately KO with Torch Song, while the high Speed tier of Scream Tail makes Sing a dangerous, albeit unreliable, disruption tool.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is rarely a TM/TR, making its distribution narrow and restricted to specific "performer" archetypes.
