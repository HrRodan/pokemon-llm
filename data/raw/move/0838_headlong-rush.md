## Identity & Mechanics
**Headlong Rush** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically debuting in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user gathers immense momentum and hurls its entire body weight into the target with the force of a tectonic shift. This reckless, all-out tackle delivers overwhelming physical trauma but leaves the user’s guard completely shattered, exposing their vitals to counterattacks.
* **Effect:** Deals massive damage but lowers the user's **Defense** and **Special Defense** stats by one stage each after use.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to trigger self-stat drops).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Functionally a Ground-type clone of *Close Combat*. It is frequently chosen over *Earthquake* on offensive sets to achieve specific OHKOs that the lower-powered Earthquake cannot reach. While it offers immense immediate pressure, the defensive drops make the user susceptible to being "revenge killed" by faster threats or priority moves. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock,** and **Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Strength Sap*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (only 5 known learners), making it a signature-adjacent tool for specific heavy hitters.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a defining STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for the top-tier Paradox Pokémon **Great Tusk** and the powerhouse **Ursaluna** (including its Bloodmoon form, though it prefers special attacks). **Torterra** also utilizes this move to significantly upgrade its offensive presence compared to older generations.
* **Coverage Utility:** **Hariyama** is a notable non-Ground user that can employ this move for heavy-duty coverage against Poison and Steel types that resist its Fighting-type STABs.
* **Acquisition:** Currently unavailable via TM/TR; it is strictly learned via **Level Up** by its limited pool of users, marking it as a rare and elite physical asset.
