## Identity & Mechanics
**Spirit Break** is a Physical Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user strikes the target with immense, soul-crushing force, exerting such psychological and physical pressure that it mentally overwhelms the foe. This Fairy-type physical assault combines brute strength with mystical energy to shatter the opponent's will to fight, effectively dampening their concentration and offensive focus.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage and guaranteed to decrease the target's Special Attack stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Special Attack.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility Attacker / Special Attacker Check.
* **Usage:** Spirit Break serves as a highly reliable, utility-focused alternative to Play Rough. While it possesses lower base power, its 100% accuracy and guaranteed secondary effect make it a superior choice for Pokémon looking to "soften" special threats. By lowering Special Attack upon contact, the user effectively increases its own Special Durability during an exchange. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), making it one of the most exclusive moves in the current meta.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Grimmsnarl**, perfectly complementing its role as a Prankster utility lead. It is also a core STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option for the Paradox Pokémon **Iron Valiant**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme exclusivity, it is not currently utilized as a coverage move by non-Fairy types. It is strictly a specialized tool for physical Fairy-type attackers that prioritize tactical debuffs over raw "nuke" potential.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via **TM/TR**; it is learned exclusively via level-up by its specific users.
