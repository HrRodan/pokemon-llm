## Identity & Mechanics
**Wing Attack** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user spreads its large, powerful wings and delivers a sharp, forceful blow to the target. This quintessential avian maneuver represents the fundamental use of a winged Pokémon's anatomy to inflict direct physical damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target with no additional secondary effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Technician Core.
* **Usage:** In early-game scenarios, Wing Attack serves as a **Reliable STAB** move with high PP. In competitive play, it is almost exclusively used by Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (like Scizor or Scyther), which boosts its base power to 90, making it a reliable mid-tier nuke without the recoil of Brave Bird or the setup requirements of Acrobatics. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), primarily consisting of Bird-like Pokémon and those with prominent wing structures.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Charizard**, **Pidgeot**, and **Dragonite**, who often utilize it as a reliable STAB option during level-up.
* **Coverage/Technical Utility:** Frequently seen on **Scyther** and **Scizor** to take advantage of the **Technician** ability. It is also utilized by **Moltres (Galar)** and **Aerodactyl** as a consistent physical Flying-type option.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a common natural move for Flying types, it is notably absent from the TM/TR lists in most recent generations, making it largely dependent on a Pokémon's natural movepool.
