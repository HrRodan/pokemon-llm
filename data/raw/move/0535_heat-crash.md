## Identity & Mechanics
**Heat Crash** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).

* **Description:** The user ignites its entire body and hurls its massive weight at the opponent, crushing them under a mantle of intense heat. This move calculates damage based on the kinetic energy generated by the user's mass relative to the target; the heavier the user is compared to the foe, the more devastating the impact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on a weight ratio. If the user is significantly heavier than the target, the Base Power increases:
    * **40 BP:** User is $\leq$ 2× target's weight.
    * **60 BP:** User is > 2× target's weight.
    * **80 BP:** User is > 3× target's weight.
    * **100 BP:** User is > 4× target's weight.
    * **120 BP:** User is > 5× target's weight.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is important to note that this move fails against Dynamaxed targets.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Weight-Dependent Wallbreaker / Consistency STAB.
* **Usage:** Heat Crash serves as a high-reward alternative to *Flare Blitz* for exceptionally heavy Pokémon. Its primary advantage is providing high-base-power damage (up to 120) without the debilitating recoil of Flare Blitz. However, its effectiveness drops significantly against other heavy "walls" (like Ting-Lu or Dondozo), making it less reliable than *Flamethrower* or *Fire Punch* in those specific matchups. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*. It is also boosted by the *Reckless* ability in some contexts.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (47 learners), primarily concentrated among heavy-bodied Fire-types and massive Ground or Steel-types.

* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Emboar** (the original Gen 5 user), **Copperajah** (whose massive weight almost guarantees 120 BP), **Coalossal**, and **Gouging Fire**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy non-Fire Pokémon like **Snorlax**, **Golurk**, and **Regigigas** to provide essential Fire-type coverage to melt Steel-type checks like Corviknight or Ferrothorn.
* **Acquisition:** While it began as a specialized move, it has become widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
