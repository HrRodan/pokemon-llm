## Identity & Mechanics
**Pin Missile** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user forcefully ejects sharp, needle-like pins, quills, or bristles from its body to strike the target in rapid succession. This multi-hit projectile attack is designed to overwhelm opponents through volume, making it difficult to dodge or block entirely.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage 2–5 times in a single turn. It has a 37.5% chance to hit 2 times, a 37.5% chance to hit 3 times, a 12.5% chance to hit 4 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit 5 times.
* **Secondary Effect:** This move bypasses and destroys **Substitutes** if one of the early hits breaks the doll, allowing subsequent hits to damage the Pokémon directly. It also effectively counters **Focus Sash** and the **Sturdy** ability by landing multiple blows.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (per hit), Accuracy 95%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Multi-hit Wallbreaker / Substitute Breaker.
* **Usage:** While inconsistent for most, it is an elite **Consistency Option** for Pokémon with the **Skill Link** ability, which forces the move to always hit 5 times for a massive 125 Base Power. It is frequently compared to *X-Scissor* (80 BP) and *Leech Life* (80 BP); while Pin Missile has lower accuracy, its ceiling for damage and ability to ignore "one-hit" protections like Sturdy make it superior in specific niches. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **projectile-based** move. Notably, it is one of the few moves that is blocked by the ability **Bulletproof**. It does not make contact, protecting the user from *Rocky Helmet* or *Rough Skin* damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (51 learners), primarily found on insectoid, spiky, or cactus-like Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** **Mega Heracross** is the premier user of this move, utilizing *Skill Link* to turn it into a terrifying 125 BP STAB nuke. Other iconic users include **Beedrill** (its signature move in Gen 1), **Scolipede**, and **Chesnaught**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by **Jolteon** in early generations to provide vital coverage against Grass and Psychic types (specifically Exeggutor). It is also seen on **Iron Thorns** and **Sandslash-Alola** for niche multi-hit physical pressure.
* **Acquisition:** While often learned via level-up, it was widely distributed as **TM07** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield).
