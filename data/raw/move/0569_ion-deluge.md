## Identity & Mechanics
**Ion Deluge** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user floods the battlefield with a dense cloud of ionized, electrically charged particles. This intense electromagnetic field alters the fundamental nature of kinetic energy, converting all Normal-type attacks—including powerful sound-based moves and priority strikes—into high-voltage Electric-type energy for the remainder of the turn.
* **Effect:** For the rest of the turn, any Normal-type move used by any Pokémon on the field (including the user, allies, and opponents) becomes an Electric-type move. 
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Priority +1).
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (Affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 25.
* **Role:** Reactive Utility / Defensive Counter-Strategy.
* **Usage:** Ion Deluge is a niche tactical move designed to disrupt opponents who rely on Normal-type "Nukes" (such as Boomburst, Double-Edge, or Explosion). Because it has **+1 Priority**, it almost always triggers before the opponent can attack. It is most effectively used in Doubles or Triples to trigger an ally's **Volt Absorb**, **Motor Drive**, or **Lightning Rod** ability by forcing an opponent's move to become Electric-type. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types (if the converted move hits them).
* **Attributes:** This move is a "Field Effect" status move. It does not make contact and is not blocked by Protect (though the subsequent converted moves might be).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution (only 10 total learners), exclusively limited to Electric-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly found on **Electivire**, **Ampharos (including Mega Ampharos)**, and **Zebstrika**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it is not a "coverage" move in the traditional sense, it is utilized by **Lanturn** and **Electivire** to turn an opponent's STAB Normal moves into attacks that trigger their own abilities (**Volt Absorb** and **Motor Drive**, respectively), granting them health or speed boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Very restricted; it is generally learned via leveling up and is notably **absent from TM/TR lists**, making it a rare sight in most competitive formats.
