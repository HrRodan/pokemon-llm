## Identity & Mechanics
**Decorate** is a **Status Fairy-type** move introduced in **Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield)**.
* **Description:** The user utilizes its culinary or artistic flair to "decorate" the target with whipped cream or festive toppings. This aesthetic enhancement serves as a powerful motivational boost, significantly amplifying the target's offensive presence. As a Fairy-type utility move, it embodies the supportive and whimsical nature of the Galar region's Pokémon.
* **Effect:** The user sharply raises the target's **Attack** and **Sp. Atk** stats simultaneously (increasing both by two stages). This move bypasses accuracy checks and is one of the few moves designed specifically to buff an ally in multi-battle formats.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the stat boosts).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Can target an ally in Doubles/Triples or an opponent in Singles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Support / Offensive Setup**.
* **Usage:** Decorate is almost exclusively a **Doubles/VGC** move. Because it targets another Pokémon, it is used to instantly transform a teammate into a "nuclear" threat. While moves like *Swords Dance* or *Nasty Plot* require the attacker to spend a turn setting up, Decorate allows a dedicated support Pokémon to provide that same +2 boost (to both offensive stats) while the attacker immediately strikes. In Singles, the move is effectively useless as it would buff the opponent.
* **Comparison:** It is a more potent version of *Helping Hand* in terms of longevity, as the +2 boost remains until the Pokémon switches out, whereas *Helping Hand* only lasts for one turn.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect/Detect** if targeting an ally; blocked by **Crafty Shield**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, serving as a signature mechanic for one specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, the move is the **Signature Move of Alcremie**. Alcremie's unique Gigantamax form and various "Cream" forms emphasize its role as the premier "Decorator" in the Pokémon world.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on other Pokémon for coverage. However, Alcremie's ability **Aroma Veil** prevents it and its ally from being affected by moves like *Taunt*, ensuring that Decorate can be executed reliably to set up a sweep.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned naturally by **Alcremie** upon evolution or via leveling up.
