## Identity & Mechanics
**Powder Snow** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user attacks by blowing a gust of chilled, powdery snow at the target. This low-intensity flurry serves as a foundational Ice-type technique, often used by Pokémon inhabiting snowy peaks or frozen tundras to numb their foes with sub-zero temperatures.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage to the target. In Double Battles, it targets all adjacent opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Freeze** the target.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread damage in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Double-Battle Spread Chip.
* **Usage:** Powder Snow is primarily used as a **progression move** for Ice-types during the early levels of a playthrough. In competitive formats, it is almost entirely outclassed by **Ice Beam** (for reliability/power) or **Blizzard** (for high-power spread damage). Its main niche is being a 100% accurate spread move that can hit both opponents in Doubles, though its low base power makes it ineffective for securing KOs. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Flying, Ground, Grass, and Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Spread Move**; in Double Battles, its damage is reduced by 25% when hitting multiple targets.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (46 learners), restricted almost exclusively to Ice-type evolutionary lines.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized during early-game stages by **Articuno**, **Glaceon**, **Alolan Ninetales**, and **Froslass**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Castform (Snowy Form)** and high-speed threats like **Iron Bundle** or **Chien-Pao** as part of their natural level-up pool, though rarely kept in final competitive movesets. 
* **Acquisition:** Powder Snow is rarely available as a TM or TR; it is almost strictly a **Level-Up** move learned between Levels 1 and 15 by most Ice-type Pokémon.
