## Identity & Mechanics
**Poison Sting** is a Physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user stabs the target with a toxic barb, needle, or stinger to deal damage. This move is characterized by its low kinetic impact but high delivery of venom, often used by insectoid or serpentine Pokémon to weaken prey in the early stages of an encounter. It is a signature "Early-Route" move frequently encountered in locations like Viridian Forest.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30%** chance to induce the **Poison** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Single-target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-game Chip Damage / Low-tier Status Inflictor.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Poison Sting is almost entirely non-viable due to its extremely low Base Power. It serves primarily as a flavoring move for low-level Pokémon. Its main rival is **Poison Jab**, which offers significantly higher damage (80 BP) while maintaining the 30% poison chance. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (46 total learners), concentrated heavily among Bug, Poison, and Ground types.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic on early-game evolutions like **Beedrill**, **Nidoking/Nidoqueen**, and **Scolipede**. It is the signature offensive move for **Weedle**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally learned by non-Poison types such as **Sandslash**, **Gliscor**, and **Galvantula**, representing their biological possession of stingers or venomous fangs, though it is rarely chosen over more powerful coverage options.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up at very low levels. It is notably **not** a common TM or TR, making its presence on a moveset a hallmark of a Pokémon's natural biological weaponry rather than coached technical skill.
