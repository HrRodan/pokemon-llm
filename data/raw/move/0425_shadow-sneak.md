## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Sneak** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user manipulates its own shadow, extending it across the battlefield to strike the opponent instantaneously from behind. By attacking from the target's blind spot, the user ensures they strike before the opponent can react. This move is a staple for physical attackers looking to bypass speed tiers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move has a **priority bracket of +1**, allowing it to execute before most other moves regardless of the user's Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** Priority Finisher / Revenge Killer.
* **Usage:** Shadow Sneak serves as the Ghost-type equivalent to Quick Attack or Mach Punch. Its primary value lies in its ability to "clean up" weakened opponents or break **Focus Sashes**. Because Ghost is an excellent offensive typing with few resistances, it is a highly reliable tool for physical attackers to pick off faster, frail threats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. As a Ghost-type move, it has no effect on Normal-type Pokémon.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily concentrated among Ghost-type Pokémon and those with "darker" or "shadow" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Aegislash:** Uses Shadow Sneak to pick off targets after softening them up with high-powered attacks in Blade Forme.
    * **Mimikyu:** Often pairs this with *Swords Dance* to become a dangerous priority sweeper.
    * **Ceruledge:** Leverages its high Attack to utilize Shadow Sneak as a reliable STAB priority option.
    * **Marshadow:** A legendary user that applies immense pressure with Technician-boosted priority.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Iron Valiant** (Fairy/Fighting) or **Greninja** (Water/Dark) via egg moves or specific movepools to provide unexpected priority and hit Psychic-type counters.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through **level-up** or **Egg Moves**. Notably, it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its presence on a team relatively predictable based on the Pokémon's species.
