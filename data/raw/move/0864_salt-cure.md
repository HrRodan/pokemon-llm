## Identity & Mechanics
**Salt Cure** is a physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user bombards the target with a specialized, dehydrating crystalline salt. This salt adheres to the opponent, continuously drawing out moisture and corroding their defenses to inflict residual damage every turn. Visually, the move manifests as a shower of salt that coats the target, creating a persistent "Salt Cure" status condition that remains until the target switches out.
* **Effect:** Inflicts 1/8th (12.5%) of the target's maximum HP as damage at the end of every turn. If the target is a **Water** or **Steel** type, the residual damage is increased to 1/4th (25%) of their maximum HP per turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (The primary effect is a guaranteed "Salt Cure" status upon hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Progressive Damage Dealer / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Salt Cure is considered one of the most oppressive utility moves in the competitive metagame. Unlike trapping moves (like Fire Spin or Magma Storm), the target can switch out to remove the effect, but the high residual damage forces frequent switching, racking up Entry Hazard damage. It is a hard counter to bulky Water and Steel-type walls (like Toxapex, Dondozo, or Corviknight), which are usually the premier defensive answers to Rock types. It deals **Super Effective** direct damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses "Protect" chip damage reduction (it deals full residual damage regardless of defensive stats).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 learners), serving as the signature mechanic for the Nacli evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Garganacl** and its pre-evolution **Naclstack**. Garganacl uses this move to become a premier defensive pivot and win-condition in the OU (Overused) tier.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not seen as coverage on other Pokémon. However, it defines Garganacl’s role as a "Passive Damage Tank," allowing it to threaten nearly the entire roster regardless of their defensive investment.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally through leveling up by the Garganacl line.
