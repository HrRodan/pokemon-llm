## Identity & Mechanics
**Wring Out** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user powerfully wrings the target, applying intense constriction and crushing pressure to squeeze out their remaining vitality. The move's potency is derived directly from the target's physical state; as the target becomes exhausted and loses health, the user's ability to "wring" more energy from them diminishes, resulting in a visual and mechanical theme of diminishing returns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the target's current HP. The power is calculated using the formula: `1 + 120 * (Current HP / Max HP)`. This results in a variable base power that peaks at 121 when the target is at full health and scales down toward 1 as the target nears fainting.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable, Max 121], Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Conditional Wallbreaker / Front-loaded Damage.
* **Usage:** Wring Out serves as a "Softener" rather than a "Finisher." It is most effective when used against a healthy opponent to force them into range for other attacks. Compared to its Physical counterpart, **Crush Grip**, it shares the same weakness: it becomes virtually useless once the opponent is below 50% HP. Unlike *Water Spout* or *Eruption*, which depend on the user’s health, Wring Out is safer for slow, bulky Pokémon to use even after they have taken damage. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; despite the flavor of "wringing," it is classified as Special damage and does not trigger effects like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, learned by 30 Pokémon primarily through leveling up.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by bulky Special attackers such as **Serperior**, **Tangrowth**, and **Lickilicky**. It is also a signature flavor move for aquatic or tentacled Pokémon like **Tentacruel** and **Jellicent**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for pure coverage due to being Normal-type, it appears in the movepools of powerful Legendaries and Ultra Beasts like **Necrozma** (all forms) and **Guzzlord**, serving as a high-BP neutral hit to punish switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Highly exclusive; it is almost never available via **TM/TR** or Move Tutor, restricted primarily to the natural level-up learnsets of specific "constrictor" or "absorber" themed Pokémon.
