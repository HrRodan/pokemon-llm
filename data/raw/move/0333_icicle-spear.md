## Identity & Mechanics
**Icicle Spear** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user launches a rapid-fire barrage of sharpened ice projectiles at the target. This multi-strike attack fires between two and five frozen shards in a single turn, piercing through defensive barriers and overwhelming the opponent with a sequence of cold-based impacts.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage 2–5 times per use. It has a 37.5% chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit 4 or 5 times.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary benefit is the multi-strike property which bypasses **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, and **Substitutes**).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (per hit), Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Multi-Strike Utility / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While its base power seems low, its utility is immense in competitive play. It is the premier tool for "breaking" through **Substitute** or bypassing **Focus Sash** and **Multiscale** (Dragonite). It is frequently compared to *Icicle Crash*; while *Icicle Crash* has a higher single-hit ceiling and a flinch chance, Icicle Spear offers superior reliability against specific defensive gimmicks. When paired with the **Loaded Dice** item (introduced in Gen 9) or the **Skill Link** ability, its damage becomes consistent and devastating.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Ground,** and **Grass** types. 
* **Attributes:** Physical, Projectile-based (blocked by Bulletproof).
