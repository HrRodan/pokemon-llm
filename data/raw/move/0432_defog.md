## Identity & Mechanics
**Defog** is a Status Flying-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user whips up a powerful, swirling gust of wind or beats its wings violently to disperse obstacles on the battlefield. This move is designed to improve visibility and clear the air of tactical obstructions, buffeting the opponent to make them easier to strike.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s evasion by one stage. Most importantly, it clears the battlefield of **Entry Hazards** (Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, and Sticky Web) and **Screens** (Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil). It also removes Mist and Safeguard.
* **Secondary Effect:** While it has no secondary status effect chance, the evasion drop is a guaranteed mechanic unless the target is behind a Substitute or protected by Mist.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (though the hazard-clearing effect typically impacts both sides of the field in modern generations).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Bypasses accuracy checks), PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Hazard Removal.
* **Usage:** Defog is a cornerstone of competitive singles play, serving as the primary alternative to *Rapid Spin*. Unlike Rapid Spin, it cannot be "Spin Blocked" by Ghost-types; however, it can be stopped by *Taunt*. A critical drawback is that it triggers the **Defiant** and **Competitive** abilities, potentially giving opponents like Bisharp or Milotic a massive stat boost. It is essential for teams featuring Stealth Rock-weak members like Volcarona or Charizard.
* **Attributes:** Wind-based move (interacts with abilities like Wind Power or Wind Rider). It bypasses accuracy checks to ensure the field is cleared even against evasion-boosted foes.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (186 learners), primarily found among Flying-types and Pokémon with wings or gust-generating capabilities.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by defensive stalwarts such as **Corviknight**, **Zapdos**, **Skarmory**, and **Mandibuzz** to maintain field control.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often carried by versatile utility Pokémon or pivots like **Gliscor**, **Scizor**, **Mew**, and **Latias** to support teammates by removing punishing entry hazards.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as **HM05** in the Sinnoh region; in later generations, it transitioned to a Move Tutor or TM/TR (Technical Record) move, making it accessible to a vast array of bird-like and mystical Pokémon.
