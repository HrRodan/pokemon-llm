## Identity & Mechanics
**Misty Terrain** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user generates a dense, ethereal pink mist that shrouds the floor of the battlefield for five turns. This mystical atmosphere purifies the air and ground, creating a serene environment that shields combatants from debilitating conditions and dampens the ferocity of draconic energy.
* **Effect:** For five turns, all grounded Pokémon (those not Flying-type or possessing the Levitate ability) are protected from major status ailments (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, Poison, Freeze) and Confusion. Additionally, the power of Dragon-type moves used against grounded targets is reduced by 50%.
* **Secondary Effect:** While active, the move **Nature Power** becomes Moonblast, and **Secret Power** gains a 30% chance to lower the target's Special Attack.
* **Targeting:** Affects the Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Field Utility / Defensive Support.
* **Usage:** Unlike other terrains that provide offensive boosts to specific types, Misty Terrain is a purely defensive **Consistency Option**. It is primarily used to shut down "Status Spam" strategies involving *Spore*, *Will-O-Wisp*, or *Thunder Wave*. It acts as a hard check to **Dragon-type** wallbreakers, effectively halving their damage output. In VGC (Doubles), it is frequently used to protect a teammate from being incapacitated while they set up.
* **Attributes:** Field Effect; lasts 8 turns if the user is holding a **Terrain Extender**.
