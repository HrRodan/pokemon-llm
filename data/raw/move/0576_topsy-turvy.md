## Identity & Mechanics
**Topsy-Turvy** is a status-class Dark-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user exerts a distorting influence over the battlefield, causing the target's current stat changes to flip. This reality-bending move turns a Pokémon's overwhelming momentum against it, transforming concentrated power into debilitating weakness and vice versa. It is a niche but devastating tool for neutralizing "set-up" sweepers.
* **Effect:** Inverts all of the target's stat modifiers. For example, a target with +2 Attack will instead have -2 Attack; a target with -1 Defense will have +1 Defense. It affects Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% effect rate on the stat inversion).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —% (Bypasses accuracy checks), PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Anti-Setup Utility / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Topsy-Turvy serves as a specialized **Check** to setup sweepers. While similar to **Haze** (which resets stats to zero) or **Clear Smog** (which resets stats via damage), Topsy-Turvy is more aggressive because it punishes the opponent for boosting. It is particularly effective against Pokémon using moves like Shell Smash or Swords Dance. Notably, it **bypasses Substitute**, allowing the user to cripple a protected foe.
* **Attributes:** As a status move, it does not deal direct damage and therefore does not trigger type-based Super Effective modifiers; however, as a Dark-type move, it can be redirected by Lightning Rod or Storm Drain if those abilities were modified (though generally, it follows standard type interaction rules for status moves).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (3 total learners), making it one of the rarest moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** The move is the signature identity of **Malamar** and its pre-evolution **Inkay**. It is often paired with Malamar's "Contrary" ability (though Malamar usually uses Contrary for its own moves, Topsy-Turvy is its defensive answer to opponents).
* **Coverage Utility:** In Generation VIII, **Grapploct** gained access to the move, using it as a defensive utility to stop physical attackers from boosting past its natural bulk.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM or TR; it is exclusively learned via level-up by its specific evolutionary lines, making it a "Specialist" move that opponents must specifically prepare for when facing its few users.
