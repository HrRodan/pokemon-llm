## Identity & Mechanics
**Head Smash** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user braces itself and delivers a devastating, life-endangering headbutt at maximum velocity. The impact is so violent that it creates a massive shockwave, shattering defenses but causing the user to suffer significant internal trauma from the collision.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. The user receives recoil damage equal to **50% (1/2)** of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure damage).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 80%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Head Smash is the Rock-type equivalent of moves like Flare Blitz or Brave Bird, but with a much higher power ceiling and a significantly more punishing recoil penalty (50% vs 33%). It is primarily used by Pokémon with the **Rock Head** ability, which negates recoil damage, turning this move into a spammable 150-power nuke with no drawback other than its shaky 80% accuracy. Compared to **Stone Edge**, Head Smash offers 50% more power at the cost of higher recoil and slightly lower accuracy. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**. Not affected by King's Rock (no flinch chance).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (35 total learners), often restricted to "heavy-headed" or prehistoric Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Rampardos:** Boasts the highest Attack stat of all non-Legendary Rock types, making its STAB Head Smash one of the hardest-hitting unboosted moves in the game.
    * **Tyrantrum:** The premier user of this move due to the **Rock Head** ability, allowing it to fire off STAB Head Smashes with zero recoil.
    * **Aggron (via Aron):** Another classic **Rock Head** user that utilizes Head Smash to punch holes through defensive cores.
    * **Great Tusk:** A top-tier competitive Paradox Pokémon that uses Head Smash for immense neutral coverage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Rock types like **Emboar**, **Scrafty**, and **Basculegion** to provide high-powered coverage against Flying or Bug-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up or as an **Egg Move**. It is notably absent from most TM/TR lists, making it a specialized tool for specific physical attackers.
