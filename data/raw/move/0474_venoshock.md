## Identity & Mechanics
**Venoshock** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user drenches the target in a concentrated, caustic poisonous liquid. This chemical cocktail is designed to react violently with biological toxins already present in a victim's bloodstream, causing a massive, painful systemic shock that deals devastating damage to those already suffering from status conditions.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is currently afflicted with the **Poison** or **Badly Poisoned** status condition, the base power of this move is doubled from 65 to **130**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance to inflict status).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65 (130 if Poisoned), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Snowball Finisher.
* **Usage:** Venoshock is a high-reward technical move that requires team synergy—specifically **Toxic Spikes** or "Corrosion" support—to be effective. While its base power is lower than standard STAB options like *Sludge Bomb* (90) or *Sludge Wave* (95), its ceiling of 130 makes it one of the hardest-hitting Special moves in the game without a recharge turn or stat drop. It is most effective on "Toxic Stall" teams or alongside Pokémon like **Glimmora** that can reliably poison the entire enemy field. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Affected by Protect, Mirror Move, and King's Rock.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (133 learners), appearing as a staple TM/TR across multiple generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Toxapex**, **Salazzle**, and **Glimmora**. Salazzle is a particularly notable user as its *Corrosion* ability allows it to poison Steel and Poison types, which otherwise ignore this move's secondary power boost. **Pecharunt** also utilizes it effectively in Gen IX.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon like **Clawitzer** or **Gengar** to punish switch-ins that have been previously poisoned by entry hazards.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in nearly every game since its debut in Black & White.
