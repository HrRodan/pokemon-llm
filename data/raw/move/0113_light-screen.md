## Identity & Mechanics
**Light Screen** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user manifests a translucent, shimmering barrier of golden psychic energy that spans their side of the battlefield. This wall acts as a mystical filter, dampening the intensity of incoming special attacks, beams, and elemental discharges. It provides a vital protective buffer, effectively doubling the team's resilience against energy-based offenses.
* **Effect:** Erects a barrier on the user’s side of the field that reduces damage from Special Attacks by 50% (1/2) in Single Battles and approximately 33% (2/3 of original damage) in Double Battles. The effect lasts for 5 turns. If the user is holding the **Light Clay** item, the duration is extended to 8 turns. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, critical hits bypass the damage reduction, and the screen is instantly destroyed if the opponent uses **Brick Break**, **Psychic Fangs**, or **Defog**.
* **Targeting:** User's Side (Field Effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Screen Setting.
* **Usage:** Light Screen is a cornerstone of "Dual Screens" strategies, almost always paired with **Reflect** to provide comprehensive damage mitigation. It is a fundamental tool for **Hyper Offense (HO)** teams, allowing fragile setup sweepers (like Belly Drum users or Quiver Dancers) to survive hits while boosting their stats. Unlike raw stat boosts, Light Screen persists even if the active Pokémon switches out, making it a powerful tool for **pivoting**. 
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; fails if the field already has an active Light Screen.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (406 learners), making it one of the most accessible utility moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Grimmsnarl:** The premier screen-setter in modern competitive play due to the **Prankster** ability, allowing it to set Light Screen with priority.
    * **Regieleki:** Utilizes its unmatched Speed tier to guaranteed-set screens before taking a hit.
    * **Klefki:** Another **Prankster** user that utilizes its Steel/Fairy typing to find safe opportunities to set barriers.
    * **Mew:** Often carries it on support sets due to its overall versatility.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Blissey**, **Tapu Koko**, and **Rotom-Wash** to provide team-wide support and turn them into "bulky pivots" that can survive powerful Special Nukes.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (traditionally TM16) across almost every generation, including the most recent Scarlet & Violet Technical Machines.
