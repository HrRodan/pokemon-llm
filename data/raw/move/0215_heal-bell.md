## Identity & Mechanics
**Heal Bell** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto region).
* **Description:** The user lets out a soothing, chime-like ringing that echoes across the battlefield. This melodic sound resonates with the user's entire party, washing away debilitating ailments and restoring mental clarity to every Pokémon on the team. It is a cornerstone "Cleric" move used to maintain team longevity.
* **Effect:** Heals all major status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, Poison, and Freeze) and confusion for the user and all Pokémon in the user's party (including those currently in their Poké Balls).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User and all allies (Party-wide).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Team Cleric / Status Cleanser.
* **Usage:** Heal Bell is a vital utility move for defensive and balanced teams. It serves as the primary counter to "Status Spam" strategies, such as **Toxic** stalling or **Will-O-Wisp** neutering physical attackers. Its main rival is **Aromatherapy**; while they function identically in curing the party, Heal Bell is a **Sound-based move**. This means it is blocked by the **Soundproof** ability but can bypass a Substitute. Its low PP makes it vulnerable to **Pressure** stall, requiring careful management in long matches.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based. Since it is a Status move, it does not deal damage and therefore has no type-weakness interactions, though it is ineffective against Pokémon with the Soundproof ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (84 learners), primarily concentrated among Pokémon with "nurturing" or "mystical" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Blissey** and **Chansey**, who serve as the premier "Clerics" of the competitive scene. Other major users include **Clefable**, **Sylveon**, and the Mythical Pokémon **Celebi**.
* **Utility Users:** Frequently seen on bulky defensive threats like **Alolan Ninetales**, **Ampharos**, and **Altaria** to ensure their teammates aren't crippled by status while they pivot or set up.
* **Acquisition:** It is rarely available via TM/TR, often requiring specialized **Egg Move** breeding or specific **Move Tutors** in various generations to obtain.
