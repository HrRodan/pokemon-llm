## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Trip** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user flaunts its superiority and boastfully channels its enhanced strength into a crushing physical blow. It is a momentum-based attack where the user’s arrogance fuels the impact; the more the user has bolstered its own capabilities through stat-raising moves, the more devastating the damage becomes.
* **Effect:** Deals damage based on the user's current stat stages. The base power starts at 20 and increases by an additional 20 for every positive stat stage the user has acquired (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is a physical counterpart to the move **Stored Power**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20 (Variable), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Setup Sweeper Payoff / Snowballing Nuke.
* **Usage:** Power Trip is a high-ceiling "Win Condition" move. While its base power is abysmal (20), it scales exponentially with setup. After just two **Bulk Ups** (+2 Attack, +2 Defense), the move reaches 100 Base Power, outclassing *Crunch*. At maximum setup, it becomes an unstoppable nuke capable of OHKOing even the sturdiest walls. It is the premier choice for physical Dark-types that can boost multiple stats simultaneously. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, learned by only 20 Pokémon. 
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Corviknight:** Frequently utilizes Power Trip in conjunction with **Bulk Up** and **Roost** to become a terrifying late-game "Iron Defense" sweeper that is difficult to remove.
    * **Krookodile:** Synergizes exceptionally well with the **Moxie** ability; every KO increases Krookodile's Attack, which in turn fuels the Power Trip calculation for the next turn.
    * **Morpeko:** Often pairs this move with its signature **Aura Wheel**, which guarantees a Speed boost every turn, naturally scaling Power Trip's damage as the battle progresses.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Incineroar** or **Cacturne** in lower-tier competitive formats to punish passive opponents that allow them multiple turns of setup.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through level-up or Egg Moves; it is not commonly available as a TM/TR, making its presence on a team a specific and telegraphed strategic choice.
