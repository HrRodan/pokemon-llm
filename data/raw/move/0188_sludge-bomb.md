## Identity & Mechanics
**Sludge Bomb** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user hurls a massive, unsanitary glob of toxic sludge at the target. Upon impact, the sludge splatters and explodes, potentially seeping into the target's system through skin contact or inhalation. This move is rich with searchable keywords like "toxic," "poison," "ball," and "projectile."
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target. It is considered a "ball" or "bomb" move, meaning it is blocked by the ability **Bulletproof**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to inflict the **Poison** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** Sludge Bomb is the gold standard for Special Poison-type offense. It is often compared to **Sludge Wave** (95 Power, 10% Poison chance); Sludge Bomb is generally preferred in Singles for its significantly higher 30% chance to poison switch-ins, providing vital chip damage against bulky walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types, making it a mandatory coverage tool in the "Fairy-slayer" meta.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is a projectile move.

It has a very wide distribution (205 learners) and has been a staple TM/TR across almost every generation.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Venusaur**, **Gengar**, **Amoonguss**, and the legendary **Eternatus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon such as **Landorus-Therian**, **Thundurus**, and **Goodra** to surprise and OHKO/2HKO Fairy-type checks like Clefable or Enamorus. 
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible via TM06 (Gen 2-4, 8-9) or TM36 (Gen 6-7), making it one of the most common special coverage moves in the game.
