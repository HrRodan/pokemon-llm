## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Guard** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** Utilizing the immense power of Dynamax energy, the user erects a nearly impenetrable barrier that shields it from all incoming attacks. This move is the Dynamax equivalent of a protection move, appearing in a Pokémon's moveset whenever they have a non-damaging (Status) move equipped while Dynamaxed.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all categories of moves (Physical, Special, and Status) for the remainder of the turn. Unlike standard protection moves like Protect or Detect, Max Guard is capable of completely nullifying the damage and secondary effects of an opponent's **Max Moves** or **G-Max Moves**, which would otherwise pierce through standard protection for 25% damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **50% failure chance** if used consecutively after itself or other protection moves (Protect, Detect, Endure, King's Shield, etc.).
* **Targeting:** Affects the **User** (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Defensive Pivot** / **Dynamax Stall**.
* **Usage:** Max Guard is a cornerstone of Gen VIII competitive strategy (VGC and Dynamax-legal formats). Its primary utility is to "stall out" an opponent's three turns of Dynamax or to scout an opponent's move choice. Because it blocks the secondary effects of Max Moves (like Max Knuckle's Attack boost or Max Flare's Weather change), it is significantly more powerful than standard Protect.
* **Attributes:** Priority **+4**. It can be bypassed by **Feint**, **Shadow Force**, and certain Gigantamax moves like **G-Max One Blow** (Single Strike Urshifu) and **G-Max Rapid Flow** (Rapid Strike Urshifu).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon capable of Dynamaxing (virtually every Pokémon in the Galar Pokédex).
* **Prominent Users:** Every competitive Dynamax threat relies on this move. Notable users include **Togekiss**, **Dragapult**, and **Charizard**, who use it to preserve their Dynamax longevity.
* **Coverage Utility:** Even hyper-offensive Pokémon like **Cinderace** or **Landorus-Therian** will carry a status move (like Bulk Up or Swords Dance) specifically to have access to Max Guard for defensive utility when Dynamaxed.
* **Acquisition:** Automatically replaces any **Status move** (e.g., Will-O-Wisp, Toxic, Thunder Wave, Swords Dance) when the Pokémon enters its Dynamax state. It is not learned via leveling, TM, or Breeding directly.
