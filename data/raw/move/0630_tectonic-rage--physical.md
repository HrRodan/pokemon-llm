## Identity & Mechanics
**Tectonic Rage (Physical)** is a Physical Ground-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** Powered by the user's Z-Power and the **Groundium Z** crystal, the user burrows deep into the earth, fracturing the terrain before erupting upward to slam the target with tectonic force. This move manifests as a massive upheaval of soil and rock, channeling the raw geological power of the Alola region into a single, devastating kinetic strike.
* **Effect:** This is a one-time-use **Z-Move**. It inflicts massive damage based on the Power of the base move it is derived from. Like most Z-Moves, it bypasses accuracy checks to never miss and can penetrate protective moves like Protect or Detect (dealing 25% of the original damage).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure damage).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100-200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used to secure a OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) on a defensive threat that would otherwise survive a standard hit. In the Gen 7 meta, it was the gold standard for bypassing **Steel, Poison, and Rock-type** walls. Its most common base move is **Earthquake**, which converts into a **180 Power** Tectonic Rage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is neither a contact move nor sound-based; it is a specialized Z-Move category.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Tectonic Rage does not have a traditional "learner" list; instead, any Pokémon capable of using a Physical Ground-type move while holding a **Groundium Z** can activate it.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Landorus-Therian:** Often used Tectonic Rage to lure in and delete bulky checks like Tangrowth or Tapu Fini after a Swords Dance boost.
    * **Garchomp:** A terrifying user that utilized the move to break through Skarmory or Celesteela (if gravity/iron ball was involved) or neutral bulky targets.
    * **Excadrill:** Used to overwhelm physical walls in Sand teams.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ground types with high Attack and access to Earthquake, such as **Gyarados** (to surprise Electric-types) or **Tyranitar**, to provide a one-time "delete button" against Steel-type counters.
* **Acquisition:** Available only in Generation VII via the **Groundium Z** Crystal, which is obtained after completing the Great Poni Canyon trial or defeating Hapu.
