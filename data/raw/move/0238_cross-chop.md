## Identity & Mechanics
**Cross-Chop** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto region).
* **Description:** The user delivers a powerful double-handed chop in a cross-shaped motion against the target. By targeting the opponent's vital points with this martial arts strike, the move has a significantly increased likelihood of landing a critical hit.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move possesses a high critical-hit ratio (+1 stage), meaning it has a 12.5% base chance (in modern generations) to bypass defensive stat boosts and screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Increased critical hit ratio is an inherent mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 80%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Cross-Chop serves as a middle-ground between the consistency of *Brick Break* and the drawback-heavy power of *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick*. While its 80% accuracy is a significant liability, its ability to ignore an opponent's Defense boosts via critical hits makes it a niche pick for breaking through "curse-stacking" or defensive walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with themes of martial arts or physical prowess.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Machamp** line, where it is frequently paired with the ability **No Guard** to bypass its 80% accuracy check, making it a perfectly accurate 100-power STAB move. It is also a staple for **Primeape/Annihilape** and **Hawlucha**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Incineroar**, **Electivire**, and **Barbaracle** to provide essential coverage against Steel and Rock-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Unlike many standard Fighting moves, Cross-Chop is rarely available as a TM/TR, often requiring Level-up or specialized **Egg Move** breeding to obtain.
