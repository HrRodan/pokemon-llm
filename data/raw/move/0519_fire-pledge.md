## Identity & Mechanics
**Fire Pledge** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user summons a concentrated pillar of flame to strike the target. While it functions as a standard attack in Single Battles, it is designed for tactical synergy in Double Battles. When combined with its elemental counterparts, it transforms the battlefield, either creating a "Sea of Fire" that damages enemies over time or a "Rainbow" that enhances the secondary effects of allied moves.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. If used in the same turn as **Grass Pledge**, it creates a "Sea of Fire" on the opponent's side, dealing 1/8th max HP damage to non-Fire types for four turns. If used after **Water Pledge**, it creates a "Rainbow" on the user's side, doubling the secondary effect chances (flinch, burn, stat drops, etc.) of all allied moves for four turns.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (standard); however, it triggers powerful field effects when used in a combo.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Synergy-Based Utility.
* **Usage:** In Single Battles, Fire Pledge is often overshadowed by **Flamethrower** (90 BP) or **Fire Blast** (110 BP) due to its lower base power. However, it serves as a "Consistency Option" for Pokémon that lack access to stronger Fire-type coverage. In VGC (Doubles), it is a niche but potent tool used to set up the **Rainbow** effect, effectively granting the team a "Serene Grace" environment to fishing for freezes, burns, or flinches. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Does not trigger King's Rock unless it is the second move in a Pledge combo.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (35 learners), restricted almost exclusively to Fire-type Starter Pokémon and a few select Mythical/Special Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard**, **Incineroar**, **Skeledirge**, and **Blaziken**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Silvally (Fire)** or **Mew**, though these Pokémon typically prefer more powerful or versatile options unless running a dedicated Pledge-combo team.
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught by a specialized **Move Tutor** (often located in the region's capital or a remote area) exclusive to starter Pokémon. In Generation IX, it is available via **TM**.
