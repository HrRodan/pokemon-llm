## Identity & Mechanics
**Double-Edge** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user recklessly throws its entire body weight into a high-velocity tackle, striking the target with devastating force. This total-commitment attack is so explosive that the user suffers significant internal and external damage upon impact, reflecting the "double-edged" nature of the maneuver.
* **Effect:** Inflicts heavy physical damage. The user takes **recoil damage** equal to 1/3 (approximately 33.3%) of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure damage with recoil drawback).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Double-Edge is the premier Physical Normal-type move for sheer damage output, especially in generations where the move *Return* is unavailable. It is frequently paired with the ability **Reckless** (which boosts its power by 20%) or **Rock Head** (which negates the recoil entirely). It also serves as a foundational move for Pokémon with "-ate" abilities (like **Aerilate** or **Pixilate**), which convert it into a 144-power STAB move of a different type.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Strength Sap.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Double-Edge has an incredibly wide distribution with over 680 potential learners, often serving as a high-tier level-up move or a classic Move Tutor/TM option.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Snorlax:** A signature STAB user that utilizes its massive HP pool to absorb the recoil damage.
    * **Staraptor:** Highly dangerous when paired with the **Reckless** ability, turning Double-Edge into a terrifying nuke.
    * **Mega Salamence/Sylveon:** Historically used this move in conjunction with **Aerilate** or **Pixilate** to create the strongest Flying or Fairy-type physical attacks in the game.
    * **Arcanine (Hisuian):** Often utilizes the move alongside **Rock Head** to strike for massive damage without the drawback of recoil.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on high-attack non-Normal types like **Garchomp** or **Dragonite** in specific restricted formats as a neutral-coverage option when their primary STABs are resisted.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** in almost every generation, including the most recent entries like *Scarlet & Violet* (TM066).
