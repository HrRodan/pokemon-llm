## Identity & Mechanics
**Tar Shot** is a Status Rock-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user ejects a deluge of thick, viscous, black tar that coats the opponent in a highly flammable and adhesive substance. This move combines speed control with elemental manipulation, sticking the target to the ground while making their body extremely combustible.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target's Speed stat by one stage and applies a unique volatile status effect that makes the target "weak to Fire." 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply both the Speed drop and the Fire-type weakness. The Fire-weakness effect essentially adds a 2x multiplier to incoming Fire-type damage, which stacks with existing weaknesses (e.g., a Grass-type would become 4x weak to Fire).
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Field Enabler.
* **Usage:** As a signature move, Tar Shot is a niche utility tool designed to facilitate "Nuke" turns for Fire-type attackers. While the Speed drop provides standard utility, the primary draw is the Fire-weakness modification. It is most effective in Doubles formats where a partner can immediately follow up with a powerful Fire-type spread move like Heat Wave or Eruption. It serves as a more specialized version of moves like *Soak* or *Forest's Curse*, specifically tailored to maximize Fire-type offensive pressure.
* **Attributes:** Hits through most standard protections but is blocked by *Crafty Shield*. Since it is a Status move, it is affected by *Taunt* and *Magic Bounce*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is the signature move of a single evolutionary line (3 total learners including pre-evolutions).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Coalossal** (and its pre-evolutions Rolycoly and Carkol). 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not found as a coverage option on other Pokémon. Its value is tied entirely to Coalossal's role as a bulky support or a Dynamax/G-Max offensive threat.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it must be learned naturally through leveling up.
