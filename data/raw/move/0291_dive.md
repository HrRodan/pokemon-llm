## Identity & Mechanics
**Dive** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation III (the Hoenn region).
* **Description:** The user plunges deep beneath the water's surface on the first turn, vanishing from the battlefield to evade incoming attacks. On the second turn, the Pokémon resurfaces with immense momentum, crashing into the target. This aquatic maneuver is famously used for both combat and exploration of underwater trenches.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn semi-invulnerable move. The user disappears on turn one and deals damage on turn-two. While "underwater," the user is immune to most moves, though it remains vulnerable to **Surf** and **Whirlpool**, which deal double damage to a diving Pokémon. It can also be hit by Pokémon with the **No Guard** ability or those that have used **Lock-On** or **Mind Reader**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Semi-Invulnerable Utility / Stall.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Dive is generally considered inferior to **Waterfall** or **Liquidation** because the two-turn window allows the opponent to switch to a resistsant counter or set up a Substitute/Boost. However, it sees niche use in **stalling** out turns of an opponent's Dynamax, Tailwind, or Trick Room. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It cannot be called by **Sleep Talk**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (161 learners), primarily consisting of Water-types and semi-aquatic species.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by iconic Water-types such as **Blastoise**, **Swampert**, and **Palafin**. It is also a signature flavor move for the Legendary **Kyogre**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon with high versatility like **Dragonite**, **Dragapult**, and **Beartic** to provide Physical Water-type coverage against Fire and Rock threats.
* **Acquisition:** Historically significant as **HM08** in the Hoenn and Sinnoh regions; it remains widely available via **TM/TR** in later generations like Sword & Shield.
