## Identity & Mechanics
**Sky Attack** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user surrounds itself in a brilliant, glowing aura and ascends to a great height on the first turn. On the second turn, it executes a high-velocity terminal dive, striking the target with immense kinetic force. This "ultimate" Flying-type maneuver is characterized by its blinding light and the sheer pressure of the descent.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn move. The user spends the first turn charging ("Preparing") and attacks on the second turn. It features an increased critical-hit ratio (one stage higher than normal).
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Due to the two-turn requirement, Sky Attack is almost exclusively used in conjunction with a **Power Herb** to allow for an instantaneous 140 BP strike. It serves as a powerful alternative to *Brave Bird* for Pokémon that cannot afford recoil damage or those looking to trigger abilities like **Unburden**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This move does **not** make contact. It cannot be called by *Sleep Talk*, making it a poor choice for "Rest-Talk" sets.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (71 learners), primarily consisting of avian or winged Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on Legendary birds like **Moltres** and **Zapdos**, as well as the Johto guardian **Lugia**. It is also a signature-style move for **Pidgeot** and **Braviary**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by **Hawlucha** as a way to consume a Power Herb immediately, doubling its speed via the *Unburden* ability while delivering a massive STAB hit. It is also seen on **Aerodactyl** as a high-power finishing move.
* **Acquisition:** Originally TM43 in Generation I, it has transitioned between being a Move Tutor staple and a high-level natural learnset move in later generations.
