## Identity & Mechanics
**Jump Kick** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user leaps high into the air before delivering a powerful, accelerated kick to the target. This high-velocity aerial assault carries extreme momentum; while devastating on impact, a failure to connect results in the user crashing violently into the ground, leading to significant self-injury.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage. However, if the move misses, is blocked by defensive maneuvers (such as **Protect** or **Detect**), or targets a Pokémon immune to the move (Ghost-types), the user suffers "crash damage" equal to **50% of its maximum HP**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The crash damage is a mechanical penalty rather than a triggered secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Jump Kick occupies a niche as a powerful Fighting-type STAB option, though it is often overshadowed by its more powerful variant, **High Jump Kick** (130 Power), or the more reliable **Close Combat** (100% Accuracy). Its primary drawback is the catastrophic "Crash Damage" penalty, making it a liability against Ghost-type switch-ins or opponents using Protect. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is notably suppressed by the field effect **Gravity**, which prevents its use entirely.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (13 total learners), limited primarily to Pokémon known for their powerful legs or kicking techniques.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with **Hitmonlee**, it is also a staple for **Mega Lopunny** (who benefits from the Scrappy ability to bypass Ghost-type immunity) and the Ultra Beast **Pheromosa**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by non-Fighting types like **Sawsbuck** and **Dodrio** to provide essential coverage against Steel and Rock-type walls that would otherwise resist their STAB attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Jump Kick is generally learned through leveling up; it is notably absent from TM/TR lists in recent generations, making its distribution very exclusive to its natural learners.
