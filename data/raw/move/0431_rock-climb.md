## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Climb** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user recklessly charges at the target with the force of an alpine climber scaling a jagged peak. This rugged, physical assault utilizes the environment's verticality to overwhelm the opponent, often leaving them disoriented and dizzy. Beyond combat, it is historically significant for its utility in the overworld, allowing trainers to scale specific rocky ledges and mountainous terrain.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20%** chance to inflict the **Confusion** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** High-Risk/High-Reward STAB or Coverage.
* **Usage:** While its base power is respectable, its sub-100 accuracy often makes it a secondary choice compared to *Return* or *Body Slam*. However, it is the premier choice for Pokémon with the **Sheer Force** ability (such as Tauros or Druddigon), which removes the confusion chance to grant a massive 30% damage boost, turning it into a 117-power nuke with no recoil. 
* **Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **neutral damage** to most types but provides no Super Effective coverage. It is **resisted by Rock and Steel** and has **no effect on Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (116 learners), primarily consisting of Pokémon with high physical prowess or those themed around mountains and rough terrain.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Bibarel** (famed for its HM utility in Sinnoh), **Garchomp**, **Lycanroc (all forms)**, and **Rampardos**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy-hitting physical attackers like **Scolipede**, **Feraligatr**, and **Steelix** to provide neutral physical pressure. It is a staple on **Sheer Force Tauros** in lower competitive tiers.
* **Acquisition:** Historically famous as **HM08** in the Sinnoh and Johto (Gen 4) regions. In modern generations, its availability has decreased, appearing primarily as a level-up or Egg Move for specific rugged species.
