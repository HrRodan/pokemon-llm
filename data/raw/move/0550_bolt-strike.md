## Identity & Mechanics
**Bolt Strike** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user envelops its entire body in a massive, surging aura of high-voltage blue electricity and charges the target with catastrophic force. As a signature move of the Deep Black Pokémon, it represents the absolute pinnacle of Physical Electric-type offense, crackling with enough power to potentially short-circuit the opponent’s nervous system.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to induce **Paralysis**, cutting the target's Speed and potentially preventing them from acting.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 85%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Bolt Strike is the premier STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) option for its users, offering significantly more power than the safer *Fusion Bolt* or the recoil-inducing *Wild Charge*. While the 85% accuracy can lead to untimely misses, the sheer damage output allows the user to OHKO or 2HKO even some of the sturdiest defensive threats in the Uber tier. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 learner in the base data).
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of the Legendary Pokémon **Zekrom**. It is also accessible to **Kyurem-Black** (via the DNA Splicers when fused with Zekrom), where it serves as its most powerful Physical STAB move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not used for general coverage by other Pokémon. However, on Zekrom and Kyurem-Black, it is essential for breaking through bulky Water-types like **Kyogre** or **Toxapex** and Flying-types like **Ho-Oh** or **Corviknight**.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned by Zekrom naturally via leveling up (usually at Level 100 or upon being caught in certain games).
