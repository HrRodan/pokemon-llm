## Identity & Mechanics
**Extreme Speed** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user charges the target with blinding, incomprehensible speed, striking with such velocity that they appear as a blur. It is the definitive "first-strike" maneuver, designed to intercept even the fastest opponents before they can execute their own strategies.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage with a **priority of +2**. This allows the user to strike before almost all other moves, including standard priority moves like Quick Attack, Sucker Punch, or Jet Punch (which are +1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Priority Revenge Killer / Late-Game Cleaner.
* **Usage:** Extreme Speed is one of the most prestigious moves in the competitive circuit. Its 80 base power combined with +2 priority makes it the premier tool for picking off weakened "glass cannons" or Choice Scarf users that would otherwise outspeed the user. It is the core of the famous **"Extreme Killer" Arceus** set and **Dragonite's** endgame cleaning potential. It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and it cannot hit **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (21 learners), often reserved for legendary Pokémon or those of exceptional martial or physical prowess.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Arcanine** (its signature user in Gen II), **Dragonite** (who often uses it to bypass its mediocre speed after a Dragon Dance), and **Lucario**, who gains a massive power boost from its *Adaptability* ability.
* **Legendary Presence:** It is a staple on **Arceus**, **Rayquaza**, and **Zygarde**, providing these behemoths with a way to ignore the Speed tier of their opponents. **Regieleki** also utilizes it to maintain its speed dominance even against other priority users.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is highly restricted. It is rarely a TM/TR and is typically learned through leveling up by specific species or as a specialized **Egg Move** (notably for Dratini and Togepi).
