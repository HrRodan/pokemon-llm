## Identity & Mechanics
**Astonish** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user lets out a sudden, startling shout or performs an abrupt, frightening movement to catch the target off guard. This jump-scare tactic is designed to trigger a fear response, potentially causing the opponent to seize up in terror and miss their turn.
* **Effect:** Inflicts low-level physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Niche Utility.
* **Usage:** Due to its exceptionally low base power, Astonish is almost never used in serious competitive play, where it is outclassed by **Shadow Sneak** (for priority) or **Shadow Claw/Poltergeist** (for raw damage). Its primary value lies in the 30% flinch chance, which can be disruptive in early-game playthroughs or when utilized by Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (boosting its power to 45). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (163 learners), appearing frequently in the movepools of Ghost, Dark, and Flying types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized during early leveling by **Decidueye**, **Dragapult**, **Gholdengo**, and **Flutter Mane**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ghost Pokémon such as **Ambipom** (leveraging Technician), **Crobat**, and **Tinkaton** as a flavor-based or early-progression move to hit Psychic threats. 
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via **Level Up**; it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, serving instead as a "starter" Ghost-type attack for many species.
