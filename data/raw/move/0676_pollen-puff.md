## Identity & Mechanics
**Pollen Puff** is a Special Bug-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user launches a dense, ball-shaped cluster of pollen at the target. When aimed at an enemy, the pollen is volatile and triggers a concussive explosion upon impact. When directed at an ally, the pollen acts as a medicinal powder, releasing soothing floral essences that instantly knit wounds and restore vitality.
* **Effect:** This move possesses a unique dual-functionality based on the target's relationship to the user. If used on an opponent, it deals standard damage. If used on an ally (primarily in Doubles/VGC), it heals that ally for 50% of their maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance to inflict status).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (can target any adjacent Pokémon, including allies).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Supportive Utility.
* **Usage:** Pollen Puff is a cornerstone move in the **VGC (Doubles)** format. While it serves as a reliable Bug-type STAB with the same power as *Bug Buzz*, its ability to provide instant 50% recovery to a partner makes it one of the best utility moves in the game. It allows a support Pokémon to pressure Dark, Psychic, and Grass types while simultaneously keeping a win-condition ally healthy. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Ball/Bomb move**; it is blocked by the Ability *Bulletproof* (e.g., Chesnaught) and is not affected by *Soundproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (40 learners), primarily concentrated among Bug and Grass-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Amoonguss:** Widely considered the best user in competitive VGC; it uses Pollen Puff to heal teammates while threatening Grass/Dark types.
    * **Ribombee:** The original signature user; its high Speed tier allows it to heal allies before they are attacked or pick off weakened Psychic/Dark threats.
    * **Calyrex-Shadow/Ice:** These powerful Legendaries utilize it as a high-accuracy alternative to other coverage moves, with the Shadow Rider form specifically using it to hit Dark-types that resist its Ghost STAB.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Meowscarada** and **Hydrapple** to provide niche coverage against opposing Grass or Dark types while offering team support in multi-battle formats.
* **Acquisition:** It has become much more accessible in recent years, appearing as **TM209** in *Scarlet & Violet* and a TR in *Sword & Shield*.
