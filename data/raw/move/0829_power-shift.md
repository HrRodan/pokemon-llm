## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Shift** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically within *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy to fundamentally reconfigure its cellular structure and combat stance. By shifting its biological priorities, the Pokémon swaps its offensive capabilities with its defensive fortitude, turning a resilient wall into a glass cannon or transforming a fragile attacker into a sturdy tank.
* **Effect:** The user swaps its current Attack stat with its Defense stat, and its Special Attack stat with its Special Defense stat. This swap persists until the Pokémon switches out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Gimmick Setup / Stat Reconfigurator.
* **Usage:** Power Shift is a highly specialized tactical move used to bypass traditional stat spreads. It is primarily compared to moves like *Power Swap* or *Guard Swap*, but since it affects the user's own base/modified stats internally, it is most similar to the "Body Press" logic of using defense for offense, or a permanent *Shell Smash* without the speed boost. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **N/A** (Status move); however, it enables the user to hit harder against types they previously couldn't threaten.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; ignores accuracy checks; not blocked by Protect (as it targets the user).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), making it one of the rarest moves in the series.
* **Prominent Users:** Effectively utilized by **Hisuian Avalugg** and **Hisuian Braviary**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Hisuian Avalugg**, this move is transformative; it allows the Pokémon to swap its massive base Defense (184) into its Attack stat, theoretically creating the hardest-hitting physical attacker in the game at the cost of its physical bulk. **Hisuian Braviary** can use it to flip its Special Defense and Special Attack to survive specific matchups or surprise opponents with shifted damage output.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM or TR and is currently limited to the movepools of specific regional forms introduced in the Hisui region.
