## Identity & Mechanics
**Quick Guard** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user assumes a defensive stance, generating a protective aura that shields the entire team from accelerated strikes. This move is specifically designed to intercept high-velocity attacks, creating a reactive barrier that nullifies moves relying on speed or priority before they can land. It is a staple tactical tool for managing the flow of high-speed combat.
* **Effect:** Protects the user and all allies from moves with a priority of +1 or higher for the remainder of the turn. This includes standard priority attacks, moves boosted by abilities like **Prankster**, **Gale Wings**, or **Triage**, and the flinch-inducing **Fake Out**. Since Generation VI, the move's success rate drops if used consecutively.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User's Field (affects the user and all active allies).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Priority Tech.
* **Usage:** Quick Guard is a cornerstone of **Doubles and VGC** formats. Unlike *Protect*, which shields a single Pokémon from almost anything, Quick Guard shields the whole field specifically from priority. Its primary function is to shut down **Fake Out** leads, allowing an ally to set up Trick Room or Tailwind safely. It also provides a hard counter to **Extreme Speed** cleaners, **Sucker Punch** mind games, and **Prankster**-boosted status moves (like *Thunder Wave* or *Will-O-Wisp*). It is often compared to *Wide Guard*, which protects against spread moves rather than priority.
* **Attributes:** Priority +3 (ensures it goes before most priority attacks, though it can be outsped by higher priority moves like *Helping Hand* or *Upper Hand*).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (64 learners), primarily concentrated among Fighting-types and highly agile avian Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Lucario**, **Mienshao**, **Gallade**, and the "Swords of Justice" trio (**Terrakion**, **Cobalion**, and **Virizion**).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon such as **Talonflame** (to protect against opposing priority while setting Tailwind), **Meowstic-Male** (utilizing Prankster to ensure the shield is set), and **Zeraora**. 
* **Acquisition:** While it is often a natural level-up move for martial-arts-themed Pokémon, it is frequently obtained as an **Egg Move** for many starters and bird Pokémon. It has rarely been available as a TM, making its presence on a team a deliberate teambuilding choice rather than a filler move.
