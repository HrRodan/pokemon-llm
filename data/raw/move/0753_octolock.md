## Identity & Mechanics
**Octolock** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user utilizes its powerful limbs to physically restrain and constrict the opponent, preventing them from being swapped out or fleeing the battlefield. This grappling maneuver exerts constant, crushing pressure that systematically compromises the target's physical and special resistances as the struggle continues.
* **Effect:** Prevents the target from switching out or fleeing (trapping effect) as long as the user remains active on the field. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Automatically lowers the target’s **Defense** and **Special Defense** by one stage each at the end of every turn the move is active.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Aggressive Trapping / Wallbreaking Utility.**
* **Usage:** Unlike standard trapping moves like *Mean Look* or *Block*, Octolock creates a "ticking clock" scenario. It is a **Checkmate** tool used to punish passive, defensive walls. By preventing a pivot, it forces the opponent to stay in while their bulk is shredded every turn, making them vulnerable to a finishing blow. It is often paired with protective moves or natural bulk to outlast the opponent’s attempts to break the hold.
* **Attributes:** As a Fighting-type status move, it is ineffective at trapping **Ghost-type** Pokémon (who are immune to trapping mechanics). It does not make contact despite the thematic description.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner), serving as a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Grapploct**.
* **Coverage Utility:** None; due to its status as a signature move, it cannot be used for coverage by other types.
* **Acquisition:** Only available to the Grapploct evolutionary line via level-up; it is not available as a TM, TR, or through Move Tutors for any other Pokémon.
