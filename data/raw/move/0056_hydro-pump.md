## Identity & Mechanics
**Hydro Pump** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user blasts a massive volume of water at the target under extreme pressure. This aquatic deluge is one of the most powerful Water-type techniques, capable of overwhelming opponents with a high-velocity torrent, though its immense power makes it difficult to aim consistently.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional secondary effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 80%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Special Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Hydro Pump is the gold standard for Special Water-type damage when raw power is prioritized over reliability. It is the primary alternative to **Surf** (which offers 100% accuracy but lower power) and **Scald** (which offers utility via burn chance). In competitive play, Hydro Pump is often required to secure specific **OHKOs** or **2HKOs** against bulky threats that would otherwise survive a weaker Water move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range, non-contact. It is notably boosted by **Rain** and the **Mega Launcher** ability (if used by Clawitzer).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (212 learners), being accessible to nearly every fully evolved Water-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Blastoise**, **Greninja**, and **Rotom-Wash** (where it serves as its primary STAB move). Legendary Pokémon like **Kyogre** and **Palkia** use it to devastating effect, especially when boosted by weather.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as high-power coverage on non-Water Pokémon such as **Dragonite**, **Hydreigon**, and **Iron Jugulis** to threaten Ground and Rock-type checks that expect Physical or Dragon-type attacks.
* **Acquisition:** It is a staple **TM/TR** in almost every generation, making it highly accessible to any Pokémon with even a remote biological affinity for water.
