## Identity & Mechanics
**Leaf Tornado** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user summons a localized, swirling vortex of razor-sharp foliage and razor-edged leaves to encircle and batter the target. This verdant cyclone obscures the opponent's vision, creating a disruptive floral storm that punishes targets with both physical lacerations and visibility issues.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a significant chance to reduce the opponent's precision.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s **Accuracy** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Disruption-based STAB / Tech Move.
* **Usage:** Leaf Tornado is generally considered a niche "Consistency Option" that trades raw power for high-variance disruption. While it hits **Super Effective** damage against **Water, Ground, and Rock** types, it is often outclassed by *Giga Drain* (for sustainability) or *Energy Ball* (for damage). Its primary value lies in the 50% accuracy drop, which can force switches or cause "hax" (luck-based wins) in lower-tier competitive formats or during casual playthroughs. However, its low 90% accuracy and meager 10 PP make it a risky choice for a mid-power move.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Contact" checks; affected by *Protect*, *Mirror Move*, and *King's Rock*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, learned by only 10 Pokémon throughout the series.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously associated with the **Serperior** line (Snivy, Servine), where it serves as a thematic STAB move during the mid-game. It is also utilized by **Victreebel**, **Shiftry**, and **Eldegoss**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Distribution is strictly limited to Grass-type Pokémon; it is almost never seen as a coverage option on non-Grass types, as it lacks the universal availability of TM moves like *Solar Beam* or *Grass Knot*.
* **Acquisition:** This move is notably **not available via TM or TR** in most generations, restricted primarily to level-up learnsets for specific floral or forest-dwelling Pokémon.
