## Identity & Mechanics
**Comeuppance** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user absorbs the force of an incoming strike and channels its indignation into a vengeful retaliatory blow. Unlike standard attacks, it focuses on redirecting the kinetic energy of the opponent's last move back at them with significantly amplified intensity, making it a "punishment" style move that thrives on the user taking damage first.
* **Effect:** Deals 1.5x the damage taken from the last opponent that hit the user during the same turn. Unlike *Counter* or *Mirror Coat*, Comeuppance can reflect damage from both Physical and Special categories.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selects the specific Pokémon that last dealt damage to the user.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Revenge Counter / Technical Punishment.
* **Usage:** Comeuppance is the Dark-type equivalent of *Metal Burst*. Its defining trait is its **0 Priority** bracket. While *Counter* and *Mirror Coat* have -5 priority (guaranteeing the user moves last), Comeuppance relies on the user being naturally slower than the target or the target using a high-priority move. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types, though the damage calculation is fixed based on HP lost rather than traditional type effectiveness (the Dark-typing primarily affects what can be hit, such as Dark-types being immune to Prankster-boosted status).
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution (5 total learners), making it a rare and often unexpected tech choice in competitive play.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Mabosstiff**, **Houndoom**, and **Honchkrow**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** **Hisuian Zoroark** is a notable user; its Illusion ability can trick opponents into using a move they believe is safe, only to be met with a massive Comeuppance retaliation. **Houndoom** can utilize its naturally frail defenses to ensure it takes enough damage to OHKO an opponent in return.
* **Acquisition:** Currently not available via TM or TR; it is learned exclusively through level-up or Egg Moves within specific evolutionary lines in Generation IX.
