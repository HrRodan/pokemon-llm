## Identity & Mechanics
**Steel Roller** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user focuses its entire body weight into a crushing roll or impact that flattens the battlefield. The sheer force of the attack compresses the ground, neutralizing any mystical or elemental energies present. This move is a high-power environmental disruptor designed to reset the field state while dealing massive damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and immediately removes any active Terrain (Electric, Grassy, Misty, or Psychic).
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but the move **fails** if there is no active Terrain on the field.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Terrain Disruptor / Anti-Meta Tech.
* **Usage:** While boasting incredible 130 Base Power (surpassing Iron Head and Meteor Mash), Steel Roller is highly situational due to its failure condition. It is primarily used as a **Check** to "Terrain Teams" (such as Psychic Spam or Grassy Glide strategies). In competitive VGC or Smogon formats, it serves as a **Wallbreaker** that can OHKO many Fairy-types while simultaneously removing their defensive or offensive terrain buffs. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), primarily concentrated among heavy-set Steel, Rock, and Ice types.
* **Prominent Users:** It is most effectively utilized by **Metagross**, **Melmetal**, and **Aggron**, who leverage their massive Attack stats to maximize the move's 130 Power.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Steel Pokémon like **Scolipede** (who uses its rolling morphology to justify the move) and **Iron Treads** to provide a high-powered response to Fairy-type threats. It is also a niche coverage option for **Dhelmise** and **Copperajah**.
* **Acquisition:** Introduced as a Move Tutor move in the Isle of Armor (Gen VIII), making it accessible to a wide variety of "heavy" or "spherical" Pokémon during that generation.
