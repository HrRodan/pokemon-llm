## Identity & Mechanics
**Menacing Moonraze Maelstrom** is a Special Ghost-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** After channeling immense Z-Power through a Lunalium Z crystal, the user—specifically Lunala or Dawn Wings Necrozma—transports the target into a spectral dimension before unleashing a catastrophic blast of lunar energy. This move represents the apex of Ghost-type offensive power, manifesting as a swirling vortex of cosmic and spiritual force that overwhelms the target's natural defenses.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage while ignoring the effects of the target's Ability that could hinder the attack. This "Mold Breaker" property allows it to bypass defensive gates like Sturdy, Multiscale, and Shadow Shield.
* **Secondary Effect:** Crucially, this move **ignores the Disguise ability**, making it a hard counter to Mimikyu.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 200, Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** As a signature Z-Move, it is used to delete a single threat from the field, regardless of their defensive abilities. It is significantly more powerful than its base move, **Moongeist Beam**, and is often used to secure KOs on bulky Psychic or Ghost types that rely on damage-reduction abilities. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Z-Move transformation of Moongeist Beam; it cannot be intercepted by most protection moves and ignores Ability-based damage mitigation.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, restricted to specific legendary configurations in Generation VII.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Lunala** and **Dawn Wings Necrozma**. 
* **Requirement:** To activate this move, the user must hold a **Lunalium Z** and know the move **Moongeist Beam**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is tied to specific Legendary Pokémon, it is not used for "coverage" in the traditional sense, but rather serves as a primary **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** finisher to bypass checks like Multiscale Dragonite or Focus Sash/Sturdy users.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII games (Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon) via the Lunalium Z crystal. In subsequent generations, Z-Moves were removed from the competitive circuit.
