## Identity & Mechanics
**Magical Torque** is a physical Fairy-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user channelizes magical Fairy energy through a rotating mechanism—specifically the engine of a modified vehicle—to strike the opponent with overwhelming force. Visually associated with the pink-tinted, shimmering exhaust and mystical torque generated by the Ruchbah Starmobile, this move combines mechanical power with ethereal energy.
* **Effect:** Deals direct physical damage. Unlike many physical Fairy moves that suffer from accuracy issues, this move is highly reliable.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10%** chance to **Confuse** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **100**, Accuracy **100**%, PP **10**.
* **Role:** **High-Power Reliable STAB** / Physical Nuke.
* **Usage:** Magical Torque is strictly superior to *Play Rough* (the standard physical Fairy move), offering 10 more base power and 10% higher accuracy. In a competitive vacuum, it serves as a premier **Wallbreaker** tool, allowing physical attackers to bypass the "accuracy coin-flip" associated with typical Fairy-type physical offense. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Dark, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a signature "Torque" move, unique to the Starmobile bosses of Paldea's Team Star.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (0 standard learners in the player's Pokédex). It is functionally a "Boss Move" used by the Team Star leaders.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Ortega's Ruchbah Starmobile** (a specialized Revavroom variant).
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is not available via TM, TR, or natural level-up for player-owned Pokémon, it currently has no coverage utility in standard VGC or Smogon formats. If it were distributed, it would be a "must-run" for physical Fairy attackers like **Azumarill** or **Iron Valiant** to replace the less reliable *Play Rough*.
* **Acquisition:** Unobtainable for players; it is coded as a signature move for the Team Star boss encounters in the Paldea region.
