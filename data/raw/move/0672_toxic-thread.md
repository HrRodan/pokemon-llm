## Identity & Mechanics
**Toxic Thread** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user ejects a specialized, venomous silk to ensnare the target. This sticky, toxic webbing not only infects the opponent with a debilitating venom but also physically restricts their movement, making it a dual-purpose debuffing tool. 
* **Effect:** Simultaneously inflicts the **Poison** status condition on the target and lowers the target's **Speed** stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to poison and lower Speed (guaranteed effect unless blocked by typing or abilities).
* **Targeting:** Single non-adjacent target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** Toxic Thread acts as a hybrid between *Poison Gas* and *String Shot*. While the move *Toxic* is generally preferred for its "Badly Poisoned" scaling damage, Toxic Thread is a niche **Consistency Option** for lower-tier arachnid Pokémon to provide immediate speed control for the team. It is effectively countered by Steel and Poison-type Pokémon, who are immune to its effects. It hits **Grass** and **Fairy** types for neutral status application, but is most effective at neutralizing fast, offensive threats that rely on their Speed tier to sweep.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Magic Coat" if reflected but is blocked by "Bulletproof" (as it is not a ball/bomb move). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 learners total), serving as a signature-style move for the Spinarak evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Ariados** and **Spinarak**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its near-exclusive distribution, it is rarely seen in higher-tier competitive play but serves as a vital tool for **Ariados** in "Untiered" or "PU" formats to act as a disruptive lead. 
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned naturally through leveling up, emphasizing its status as a specialized biological trait of Johto's spider Pokémon.
