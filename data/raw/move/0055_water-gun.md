## Identity & Mechanics
**Water Gun** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user shoots a concentrated, pressurized stream of water at the target to inflict damage. As one of the most fundamental elemental techniques, it represents a Pokémon's basic ability to manipulate hydro-kinetic energy, often serving as the primary projectile for young Water-types before they master more destructive moves like Hydro Pump.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance of secondary status or stat modification).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-Game STAB / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** In a competitive context, Water Gun is considered "filler" and is almost never used in serious metagames (OU, Ubers, etc.) due to its low base power. It is strictly outclassed by **Water Pulse** (60 BP), **Scald** (80 BP), and **Surf** (90 BP). Its primary value is in "Little Cup" (LC) or during the early stages of a main-series playthrough. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. It is not affected by abilities like Iron Fist but is boosted by **Mega Launcher** (though it is not a "pulse" move, its evolved forms often are).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (192 learners), being the universal baseline for Water-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic Water-type starters utilize this as their first STAB move, including **Squirtle**, **Mudkip**, **Piplup**, and **Sobble**. It is also a core part of the movepool for top-tier threats like **Greninja** and the Hero-form **Palafin** during their early level-up phases.
* **Coverage Utility:** In Generation I, it had unusual distribution among non-Water types due to TM06. It can be found in the movepools of Pokémon like **Nidoking**, **Rhydon**, and **Dragonite**, although these Pokémon almost always prefer higher-damage coverage options like Surf or Ice Beam.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM06** in the Kanto-based games (Red/Blue/Yellow). In all subsequent generations, it has shifted to a natural level-up move for nearly every Water-type species.
