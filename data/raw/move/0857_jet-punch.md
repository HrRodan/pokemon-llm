## Identity & Mechanics
**Jet Punch** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user summons a high-pressure aquatic torrent around its fist and delivers a strike at blinding, supersonic speeds. This hydro-kinetic punch is executed with such velocity that it bypasses the opponent's reaction time, ensuring the user strikes first in most combat scenarios. It is functionally a strictly superior version of the classic move *Aqua Jet*.
* **Effect:** This move has a **Priority of +1**, allowing the user to attack before the target, regardless of their relative Speed stats, unless the target also uses a priority move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Priority Finisher** / **Revenge Killer**.
* **Usage:** Jet Punch represents significant power creep in the priority move category. With 60 Base Power—50% stronger than *Aqua Jet*—it allows its users to pick off weakened threats or deal massive **STAB** damage before a faster opponent can move. It is particularly devastating when used by Pokémon with high Attack stats, turning a utility move into a potent offensive threat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move. As such, its damage is amplified by the *Iron Fist* ability and the *Punching Glove* held item, while being blocked by the *Protective Pads* or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 learners), functioning as a signature move for its specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Palafin (Zero Form)** and **Palafin (Hero Form)**. In its Hero Form, the move becomes a "Priority Nuke" due to Palafin's astronomical 160 Base Attack stat.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Water Pokémon can learn this move, as it is restricted to the Palafin line to emphasize its "superhero" archetype.
* **Acquisition:** It is a **Signature Move** and is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for other species. Under standard Paldean mechanics, it is learned upon evolution.
