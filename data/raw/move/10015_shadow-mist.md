## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Mist** is a Status Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically within the GameCube title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user exhales an eerie, swirling fog of dark energy that blankets the opposing side of the battlefield. This supernatural mist clings to opponents, obscuring their surroundings and making it significantly harder for them to dodge incoming attacks.
* **Effect:** Lowers the evasion of all targets on the opponent’s field by two stages.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Opponent's Field (Hits both opponents in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP [Infinite/Shadow].
* **Role:** Evasion-Reducing Utility.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD*, Shadow Mist serves as a specialized utility move used to ensure that high-powered but low-accuracy Shadow moves (like Shadow End or Shadow Blast) find their mark. It acts as the Shadow-type equivalent to **Sweet Scent**, though it is more potent as it drops evasion by two stages rather than one. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Shadow move, it exists outside the traditional type chart. In *Pokémon XD*, Shadow moves are "Super Effective" against all non-Shadow Pokémon and "Not Very Effective" against Shadow Pokémon. However, as a **Status move**, these damage multipliers do not apply.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Protect" and "Detect" in certain iterations of the XD engine; targets the entire opposing field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Shadow Mist has a restricted distribution, exclusive to **Shadow Pokémon** encountered in the Orre Region. It cannot be learned by normal Pokémon or transferred to the core handheld RPGs (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald).
* **Prominent Users:** Typically found on early-game Shadow Pokémon to provide utility. Notable users include **Shadow Teddiursa**, **Shadow Poochyena**, **Shadow Ledyba**, and **Shadow Spinarak**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Since Shadow moves are restricted to "Shadow" versions of Pokémon, this move is never used for coverage on standard builds. It is strictly a temporary tool used by trainers during the purification process.
* **Acquisition:** It is a "natural" move known by Shadow Pokémon upon capture; it is not available via TM, HM, or Move Tutor. When a Pokémon is **Purified**, this move is lost and replaced by a standard move.
