## Identity & Mechanics
**Hydro Vortex (Special)** is a Special Water-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** A signature Z-Move manifestation where the user creates a colossal, churning whirlpool that traps the target in a crushing oceanic abyss. This move represents the ultimate expression of Water-type energy, condensed into a single, inescapable tidal force that drowns the opposition in high-pressure currents.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used if the trainer possesses a **Waterium Z** and the Pokémon knows a base Special Water-type move. It converts the base move into a one-time, high-power nuke. Like most Z-Moves, it bypasses accuracy checks and ignores evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, if the base move has a secondary effect, it is usually lost in favor of raw damage (unless it is a status-Z variant, which this is not).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Power Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Hydro Vortex is used to delete a specific threat that would otherwise survive a standard hit. For example, a **Waterium Z Keldeo** or **Primarina** can use this move to OHKO bulky neutral targets or Pokémon that naturally resist Water-type moves due to its immense base power (often 175 or 185 when used with *Hydro Pump*). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect/Detect** (dealing 25% of the total damage), Never-Miss Accuracy, Z-Move mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn Special Water-type moves in Generation VII.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Primarina** (utilizing its high Special Attack), **Keldeo** (to break through physical walls), and **Greninja** (to secure KOs without the accuracy risk of Hydro Pump).
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Water Pokémon that learn Water-type coverage via TM, such as **Palkia** or **Mew**, to provide a surprise "nuke" against Fire-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Waterium Z** Crystal, obtained after completing the trial of Lana at Brooklet Hill in the Alola region. In competitive formats, it is restricted to Gen VII (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon) as Z-Moves were removed in later generations.
