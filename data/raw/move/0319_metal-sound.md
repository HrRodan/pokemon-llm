## Identity & Mechanics
**Metal Sound** is a Status Steel-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user creates a piercing, high-pitched screech by rubbing metallic body parts together or emitting a dissonant frequency. This horrible noise vibrates through the target, causing them to flinch and lose focus, which leaves their mental and magical defenses wide open to special attacks. As a **sound-based move**, it bypasses a target's Substitute but is completely negated by the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Effect:** Sharply lowers the target's Special Defense stat by two stages (-2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply stat reduction upon a successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 85%, PP 40 (Max 64).
* **Role:** Special Wallbreaker / Setup Utility.
* **Usage:** Metal Sound is primarily used to facilitate a "Special Nuke" strategy. By cutting the opponent's Special Defense in half, it effectively doubles the damage of subsequent special attacks. While it is less accurate than its Dark-type counterpart, *Fake Tears* (100% accuracy), it is more widely distributed among Steel and Electric-type Pokémon. It is highly effective in **Tera Raids** to quickly prepare a boss for a one-shot knockout. In standard play, it deals with defensive walls like Blissey or Clodsire by forcing them to switch out or face massive damage.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based move (bypasses Substitute).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (84 learners), primarily consisting of metallic, crystalline, or electrical Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-tier threats like **Miraidon**, **Gholdengo**, **Lucario**, and **Toxtricity** (who benefits from sound-based synergies).
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Steel Special Attackers like **Zapdos**, **Sandy Shocks**, and **Iron Moth** to break through dedicated special tanks that would otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** It is highly accessible, featuring as **TM11** in *Scarlet and Violet* and appearing as a machine or tutor move in several previous generations.
