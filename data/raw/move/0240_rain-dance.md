## Identity & Mechanics
**Rain Dance** is a Status Water-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user performs a mystical dance to summon a heavy downpour that saturates the battlefield for five turns. This torrential rain enhances Water-type affinity, douses flames, and creates a tactical environment that alters the accuracy of certain moves and the physiology of various Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Changes the weather to Rain for five turns (eight if the user holds a **Damp Rock**). Under Rain:
    * **Water moves** deal 50% more damage.
    * **Fire moves** deal 50% less damage.
    * **Thunder** (and Hurricane) bypass accuracy checks to hit 100% of the time.
    * **Solar Beam** power is reduced by 50%.
    * Recovery moves like **Morning Sun, Synthesis,** and **Moonlight** only heal 25% of max HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** Activates specific abilities: **Swift Swim** (doubles Speed), **Dry Skin** (heals 1/8 HP/turn), **Hydration** (cures status), **Rain Dish** (heals 1/16 HP/turn), and transforms **Castform**.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Field Utility / Archetype Enabler.
* **Usage:** While often superseded by the Ability **Drizzle** (which sets rain automatically upon entry), manual Rain Dance is a vital **Setup** tool for "Rain Teams" in formats where Drizzle is banned or unavailable. It is used to overwrite opposing weather (Sun, Sand, or Snow) and provide a massive **Nuke** boost to Water-type wallbreakers.
* **Attributes:** Weather-changing move; affects all Pokémon on the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an incredibly wide distribution (843 learners), being a staple TM/TR move across almost every generation.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Water types such as **Blastoise**, **Swampert**, and **Pelipper** often utilize it to ensure weather control. Legendary Pokémon like **Kyogre** and **Lugia** also have access to it.
* **Coverage & Synergy Users:** Frequently carried by Electric and Dragon types like **Zapdos**, **Dragonite**, and **Goodra**. These Pokémon use Rain Dance to ensure their **Thunder** or **Hurricane** attacks never miss while simultaneously weakening incoming Fire-type coverage moves.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in nearly every mainline Pokémon game since its debut in Johto.
