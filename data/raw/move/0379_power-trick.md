## Identity & Mechanics
**Power Trick** is a status-based Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user harnesses latent telekinetic energy to fundamentally restructure its physical attributes, shifting its focus from protection to pure aggression. It internally recalibrates its essence, converting its innate durability and armor into raw kinetic force.
* **Effect:** The user swaps its own **Attack** stat with its **Defense** stat. This swap applies to the "original" stats (base stats plus IVs/EVs), and the effect persists until the user switches out or uses the move again. Critically, this effect can be transferred to a teammate via **Baton Pass**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects only the user (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Gimmick Wallbreaker / High-Risk Setup.
* **Usage:** Power Trick is a highly specialized move used to transform ultra-defensive "walls" into "glass cannons." By swapping a massive Defense stat into Attack, a Pokémon can achieve the highest possible offensive ceiling in the game. However, it leaves the user extremely vulnerable, as their previously high Defense becomes a negligible Attack stat. It is often compared to **Power Swap** or **Guard Swap**, but differs because it only affects the user's internal stats rather than trading stats with an opponent.
* **Context:** Because it is a status move, it does not deal damage; however, it enables the user to deal massive Physical damage in subsequent turns.
* **Attributes:** This move is **Psychic-type**, meaning it is blocked by the ability *Good as Gold* or the move *Taunt*, but it does not check for type immunity as it targets the user.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Power Trick has a very narrow distribution, learned by only **14 Pokémon**.
* **Prominent Users:** The move is synonymous with **Shuckle**, which possesses the highest base Defense in the game (230), allowing it to reach an unprecedented Attack stat of 614+ after a swap. It is also learned by **Aegislash**, though its *Stance Change* ability usually makes the move redundant.
* **Strategic Users:** **Claydol** and **Medicham** are notable users that can utilize their decent defensive profiles to surprise opponents with a sudden physical surge.
* **Coverage Utility:** While primarily a STAB-adjacent utility for Psychic types like **Abra**, it is most often seen on Bug/Rock or Steel types with lopsided defensive stats to bypass traditional walling. 
* **Acquisition:** It is a relatively rare move, primarily learned through leveling up; it has not been a standard TM/TR in recent generations, making its presence in a battle a high-signal indicator of a specific gimmick strategy.
