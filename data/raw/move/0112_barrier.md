## Identity & Mechanics
**Barrier** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user creates a shimmering, translucent wall of psychic kinetic energy or a hard physical field around itself. This reinforces the user's cellular structure or creates a localized gravitational pushback, significantly bolstering physical resilience and shielding against incoming impact-based strikes.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user's Defense stat by two stages (+2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Physical Wall Reinforcement.
* **Usage:** Barrier is used to transform a Pokémon into a "Physical Tank," allowing it to withstand heavy hits from physical attackers and potentially out-stall opponents. It is functionally identical to **Iron Defense** and **Acid Armor**. While it helps mitigate damage from **Fighting**, **Poison**, and **Bug** types, it is highly susceptible to **Critical Hits** (which bypass stat boosts) and the move **Unaware** (which ignores the boost entirely).
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the user; affected by Snatch.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (30 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic-types and certain crystalline or aquatic Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include the legendary **Mewtwo**, the high-speed glass cannon **Alakazam** (to patch its poor physical bulk), and **Mr. Mime**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often utilized by defensive pivots like **Tentacruel** and **Cloyster** to enhance their survivability against physical threats that would otherwise capitalize on their typing. 
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up in earlier generations. Notably, Barrier was removed from the active movepool in Generation VIII, with many of its former users transitioning to **Iron Defense** via TR/TM.
