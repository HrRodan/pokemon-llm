## Identity & Mechanics
**Geomancy** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** Drawing upon the raw energy of nature and the earth, the user enters a meditative state to absorb environmental power. On the following turn, this stored energy erupts, drastically enhancing the user's offensive and defensive capabilities. As the signature move of Xerneas, the Life Pokémon, it represents the pinnacle of restorative and empowering Fairy-type energy.
* **Effect:** The move functions in two phases. On the first turn, the user "absorbs energy" (Charging Turn). On the second turn, it raises the user’s **Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by two stages (+2 each)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The stat boosts are the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Omni-Booster / Ultimate Win Condition.**
* **Usage:** Geomancy is widely considered one of the most powerful setup moves in Pokémon history. In competitive play (specifically Ubers and VGC), it is almost exclusively paired with the **Power Herb** hold item, which consumes itself to allow the move to complete in a single turn. Once activated, the user becomes a "Geomancy Sweeper," capable of outspeeding almost the entire unboosted metagame and securing OHKOs with boosted STAB moves. 
* **Type Context:** While the move itself deals no damage, it facilitates Fairy-type offense, which deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Dark, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** Charging Move (can be bypassed by Power Herb or called by Sleep Talk). It is susceptible to *Taunt*, *Encore*, and *Haze*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, **Xerneas** is the only Pokémon capable of learning this move. It defines Xerneas's entire competitive identity, often referred to as "GeoXern."
* **Coverage Utility:** None. Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on coverage attackers or via TM/TR.
* **Acquisition:** Only available to Xerneas via level-up. It cannot be passed down through breeding or taught to other Pokémon through standard technical machines.
