## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Darts** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user launches the Dreepy living inside its horns like homing missiles to strike the opposition. This projectile-based attack is unique in its "smart" execution; it is a multi-strike move where the user attacks twice in rapid succession. In Double Battles, the move's intelligence shines: if there are two viable targets, it strikes each one once; if one target is protected or fainted, both hits automatically redirect to the remaining vulnerable target.
* **Effect:** Strikes the target twice. In Double Battles, it hits each opponent once. If one opponent is immune (Fairy-type) or using a protection move (Protect/Detect), both hits will target the other opponent.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (with smart redirection in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (effectively 100), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** As a 100-power move with no drawbacks (unlike the lock-in of *Outrage* or the stat drops of *Draco Meteor*), it is the premier Physical Dragon-type STAB. Its multi-hit nature allows it to **break Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and Multiscale**, and it can bypass a **Substitute** to deal damage with the second hit. In VGC/Doubles, its smart-targeting mechanic makes it difficult to play around with redirection or protection. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not a contact move**, meaning the user does not take damage from Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin. It is considered a projectile/ballistic move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of the Dragapult line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Dragapult**. It defines Dragapult’s physical and mixed sets, allowing it to capitalize on its base 120 Attack and 142 Speed.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, for Dragapult, it provides essential neutral pressure against almost the entire tier, excluding Fairy and Steel types.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned exclusively via level-up by Dragapult upon evolution.
