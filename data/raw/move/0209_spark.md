## Identity & Mechanics
**Spark** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user generates a powerful burst of static electricity and charges into the target, releasing a crackling discharge upon contact. This high-voltage impact is designed to overwhelm the opponent's nervous system, often leaving them immobilized by lingering electrical currents. It is a fundamental tool for Physical Electric attackers who require a balance of damage and utility.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to induce the **Paralysis** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** Spark serves as a highly reliable mid-tier STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, primarily valued for its **30% Paralysis rate**, which is significantly higher than that of *Thunder Punch* (10%). While it lacks the raw power of *Wild Charge* (90 Power), it does not inflict recoil damage, making it a safer "Consistency Option" for physical attackers. In lower competitive tiers, it acts as a form of **Speed Control**, as a lucky paralysis proc can effectively neutralize an opponent's sweep. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, learned by 79 different Pokémon through leveling up.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Physical Electric types such as **Luxray**, **Pawmot**, and **Zebstrika** frequently rely on Spark during the mid-game. It is also a staple in the movepools of **Boltund** and **Manectric**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Electric types like **Probopass** and **Alolan Golem**, who utilize the move to punish Flying-type switch-ins with Physical Electric damage.
* **Acquisition:** While it is a common level-up move for most Electric-type families, it is rarely distributed as a TM or TR, making it a signature "innate" move for natural Spark-users.
