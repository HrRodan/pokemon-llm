## Identity & Mechanics
**Psychic Noise** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user emits a piercing, discordant cacophony of psychic energy that assaults the target's senses. This auditory attack is so disruptive that it creates a lingering mental interference, preventing the target from focusing enough to mend its wounds.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and applies a unique "Heal Block" status to the target for two turns. During this window, the target is unable to recover HP through any means, including recovery moves (Recover, Roost), Abilities (Regenerator), or held items (Leftovers, Shell Bell).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to inflict the **Heal Block** condition upon hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Enemy.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Stall-Breaker / Anti-Meta Utility.**
* **Usage:** While its Base Power is lower than *Psychic* (90) or *Psyshock* (80), Psychic Noise is a premier tool for dismantling defensive cores. It is specifically used to prevent "Recovery Loop" strategies where walls like Dondozo, Clodsire, or Blissey outlast opponents. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move. It **bypasses Substitute**, hitting the target directly, but is completely negated by the **Soundproof** Ability. It also triggers items like **Throat Spray**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (77 learners), making it a common utility option for Special Attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Iron Crown**, **Hatterene**, and **Gothitelle**. In Gothitelle's case, combining this move with the *Shadow Tag* ability allows it to trap a defensive Pokémon and prevent it from healing, ensuring a KO.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Primarina** (who can turn it into a Water-type move via *Liquid Voice*), **Gengar**, and **Noivern** to punish switch-ins from bulky Fairy or Poison-type walls.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in the Generation IX DLC, *The Indigo Disk*.
