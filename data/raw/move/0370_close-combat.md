## Identity & Mechanics
**Close Combat** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user abandons all defensive precautions to engage the target in a relentless, close-quarters melee assault. By throwing its entire weight and focus into the strike, the user leaves itself momentarily vulnerable to counter-attacks, characterized by a visible drop in its physical and special fortitude.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage to a single target. Immediately following the attack, the user’s **Defense** and **Special Defense** stats are lowered by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's defensive stats.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target (adjacent).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Damage Wallbreaker / Premium STAB.
* **Usage:** Close Combat is considered the gold standard for Physical Fighting-type moves. It is favored over **Superpower** because it lowers defenses rather than Attack, allowing the user to maintain its offensive pressure. It is also preferred over **High Jump Kick** due to its perfect accuracy and lack of "crash damage." It is a premier tool for punching through Steel-type walls and Dark-type threats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Rock, Steel, Ice, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (157 learners), appearing on nearly every high-tier physical attacker with a martial arts or aggressive theme.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Infernape**, **Lucario**, and **Staraptor**. In modern competitive formats, it is a staple for **Great Tusk**, **Urshifu (both styles)**, and **Iron Hands**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Zacian-Crowned**, **Arcanine**, and **Braviary** to provide essential neutral coverage and the ability to OHKO Steel or Rock-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely accessible as a high-tier **TM (Technical Machine)** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
