## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Rage** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user summons a burst of mystical shockwaves or exhales a concentrated beam of draconic energy to strike the foe. Unlike standard attacks that rely on the user's stats or the target's defenses, this move manifests an uncontrollable fury that guarantees a consistent impact on the target's physical stamina.
* **Effect:** It deals a fixed amount of **40 HP** damage to the target. It ignores all stat modifiers (Attack, Special Attack, Defense, Special Defense) and ignores type-based weaknesses or resistances.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Fixed 40], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Early-Game Nuke / Fixed-Damage Utility.
* **Usage:** In standard Level 100 competitive play, Dragon Rage is virtually non-existent as 40 HP is a negligible fraction of a Pokémon's total health. However, it is **notoriously dominant in Little Cup (LC)** or low-level playthroughs. Since most unevolved Pokémon at Level 5 have between 20 and 30 HP, Dragon Rage acts as a "One-Hit KO" (OHKO) move against almost the entire unevolved roster. 
* **Type Matchups:** While it ignores type effectiveness for damage calculation, it is still subject to **Type Immunities**. Consequently, it deals 0 damage to **Fairy-type** Pokémon (Gen VI onwards), though it hits Steel-types for the full 40 damage despite their usual resistance to Dragon.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not affected by King's Rock or similar items beyond its standard utility.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (38 learners), primarily concentrated among Dragon-types and Pokémon with draconic motifs.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic draconic Pokémon such as **Dragonite**, **Garchomp**, **Haxorus**, and **Hydreigon** learn this naturally during their early evolutionary stages.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently found on non-Dragon types like **Charizard**, **Gyarados**, and **Arcanine**, reflecting their lore-based connection to "dragon-like" power. **Lapras** and **Aerodactyl** also utilize it as a reliable damage source in early-game scenarios.
* **Acquisition:** It was famously available as **TM23** in Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow). In modern generations, it is often a "starter" move for Dragon-type breeds to provide them with early-game consistency before they learn high-power moves like Dragon Claw or Outrage.
