## Identity & Mechanics
**Tackle** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lunges forward with its entire body, using its weight and momentum to collide with the target. As one of the most fundamental physical maneuvers in the Pokémon world, it represents a basic display of strength and is often the first offensive technique a young Pokémon masters.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target. It has no additional effects or modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-Game Filler / Standard Basic STAB.
* **Usage:** Virtually non-existent in competitive play. While reliable with 100% accuracy, its low base power makes it strictly inferior to almost every other Physical Normal-type move. It is universally replaced by higher-value options like **Body Slam** (for paralysis chance), **Double-Edge** (for raw power), or **Quick Attack** (for priority). It deals **neutral damage** to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and cannot hit **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution, being one of the most common moves in the franchise (**479 learners**).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic as the starting move for many Starters and early-route Pokémon, including **Bulbasaur**, **Squirtle**, **Eevee**, and **Lechonk**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While many non-Normal types like **Garchomp**, **Tyranitar**, and **Metagross** learn it by level-up, it is never used for coverage because Normal-type moves cannot hit any Pokémon for Super Effective damage. It serves purely as a placeholder during the leveling process.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up at Level 1 or 5 across all generations. It is not available as a TM or TR, as nearly every compatible Pokémon possesses the move inherently from birth.
