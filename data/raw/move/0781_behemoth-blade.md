## Identity & Mechanics
**Behemoth Blade** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user, specifically Zacian in its Crowned Sword form, wreathes its blade in ethereal blue energy, grows to a titanic size, and delivers a devastating slash that can cleave through even the largest foes. It is the signature move of Zacian-Crowned, embodying its role as a legendary protector against the Darkest Day.
* **Effect:** This move deals double damage (200 Base Power) if the target is currently **Dynamaxed** or **Gigantamaxed**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Specialized Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Behemoth Blade is the gold standard for Steel-type offense in the Ubers tier. While its anti-Dynamax mechanic was its defining feature in Gen 8 VGC and Battle Stadium Singles, its perfect accuracy and high base power make it a superior choice over Iron Head or Meteor Mash. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Rock, and Ice** types, famously allowing Zacian to OHKO many Xerneas and Grimmsnarl variants.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Locked** distribution (Technically 0 base learners, as it is a form-change mechanic).
* **Prominent Users:** It is exclusively used by **Zacian (Crowned Sword)**. 
* **Mechanic Note:** Zacian does not "learn" Behemoth Blade via leveling or TM. Instead, if a Zacian that knows the move **Iron Head** enters a battle while holding the **Rusted Sword** item, Iron Head is automatically transformed into Behemoth Blade for the duration of the encounter.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme power and Zacian's *Intrepid Sword* ability, it is rarely replaced. It provides essential neutral coverage against almost everything that isn't a Steel, Fire, Water, or Electric type.
* **Acquisition:** Only available through Zacian's transformation in Sword, Shield, and subsequent generations where Zacian is transferable.
