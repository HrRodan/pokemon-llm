## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Wave** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically within the side-series title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.

*   **Description:** The user exhales or radiates a rippling tide of dark, corrupted energy that washes across the battlefield. This move is a manifestation of a Pokémon's closed heart, characterized by its signature purple-and-black visual aura. It serves as an early-game area-of-effect (AoE) attack for Shadow Pokémon.
*   **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. In its native games, Shadow-type moves are unique in that they deal **Super Effective** damage to any Pokémon that is not a "Shadow Pokémon," while being **Not Very Effective** against other Shadow Pokémon.
*   **Secondary Effect:** None.
*   **Targeting:** **Opponents-Field**; it strikes both opposing Pokémon in Double Battles without hitting the user's ally.

## Competitive Profile
*   **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP [N/A].
*   **Role:** **Early-game Spread Chip.**
*   **Usage:** Within the context of the Orre Region games (*Colosseum/XD*), Shadow Wave is the Shadow equivalent of moves like *Swift* or *Razor Leaf*, but with superior typing. Since almost every opponent in the game uses non-Shadow Pokémon, Shadow Wave acts as a reliable, unresisted nuke against the entire opposing field during the early stages of the journey. It is eventually replaced by **Shadow Storm** for higher damage output.
*   **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all 17 standard types** (Normal, Fire, Water, Grass, etc.) and is resisted only by other **Shadow Pokémon**.
*   **Attributes:** As a Shadow move, it does not use PP; instead, it can be used indefinitely until the Pokémon's heart is purified. It is categorized as a Special move, making it more effective on Pokémon with higher Special Attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, exclusive only to "Shadow" forms of Pokémon found in the Orre region. It cannot be learned by any Pokémon in the core series games (Ruby/Sapphire/Emerald, etc.).

*   **Prominent Users:** It is most famously used by early-game Shadow Pokémon in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, such as **Shadow Teddiursa**, **Shadow Ledyba**, **Shadow Poochyena**, and **Shadow Houndour**.
*   **Coverage Utility:** Not applicable. Shadow moves are intrinsic to the "Shadow" status; once a Pokémon is purified to its normal state, it forgets Shadow Wave and replaces it with a standard move.
*   **Acquisition:** Impossible to obtain via TM/TR. It is a "fixed" move that comes pre-installed on specific Shadow Pokémon caught from Cipher members.
