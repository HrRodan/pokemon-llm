## Identity & Mechanics
**Grass Pledge** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user summons a localized pillar of mystical forest energy to strike the target. While formidable on its own, its true power is unleashed in multi-battle scenarios; when combined with its Fire or Water counterparts, it transforms the battlefield into a hazardous environment, manifesting as either a scorching field or a restrictive swamp.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. Its unique property is the **Pledge Synergy**: 
    * If used with **Fire Pledge**, it creates a "Sea of Fire" on the opponent's side, dealing 1/8 max HP damage each turn for 4 turns. 
    * If used with **Water Pledge**, it creates a "Swamp," reducing the opponents' Speed to 1/4 for 4 turns.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (standard damage), but gains a Power boost to 150 when successfully comboed.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokemon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Synergy-Based Utility.
* **Usage:** In Singles, it serves as a **Consistency Option**, comparable to *Energy Ball* (90 BP) but with slightly lower power and no Special Defense drop chance. In Doubles/VGC, it is a **Setup Piece** for speed control (Swamp) or chip damage (Sea of Fire). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Does not make contact. Not a pulse, wind, or sound-based move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow, specialized distribution (34 total learners), restricted almost exclusively to Grass-type Starter Pokémon and a few unique chameleons of the Pokémon world.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Venusaur**, **Serperior**, **Meowscarada**, and **Sceptile**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for coverage due to its distribution, **Mew** and **Silvally-Grass** can utilize it to facilitate Pledge combos in specialized team archetypes.
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught via a Move Tutor (the Pledge Tutor) in various regions, it is now available via **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
