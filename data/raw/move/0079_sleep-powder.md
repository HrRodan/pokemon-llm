## Identity & Mechanics
**Sleep Powder** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user scatters a cloud of soporific, irritating spores from its body, petals, or wings. Those who inhale the fine dust are overcome by a heavy drowsiness, often falling into a deep slumber. As a **powder-based move**, it is central to the identity of many botanical and insectoid Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Causes the target to fall under the **Sleep** status condition. While asleep, the target cannot execute moves for 1–3 turns (mechanics vary by generation).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Direct Status Application).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 75%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Setup Enabler / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Sleep Powder is a high-stakes disruption tool. While it lacks the perfect accuracy of *Spore*, its wider distribution makes it a staple for many Grass and Bug types. It is often used to force a "switch-out" or to incapacitate a **Wall** or **Sweeper**, providing a free turn for the user to use setup moves like *Quiver Dance* or *Growth*.
* **Mechanics Note:** Since Generation VI, **Grass-type Pokémon**, Pokémon with the **Overcoat** ability, and those holding **Safety Goggles** are completely immune to Sleep Powder.
* **Attributes:** Powder-based move (blocked by Overcoat/Safety Goggles).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (38 learners), primarily concentrated among Grass-type and Bug-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Venusaur:** A classic user that utilizes the move to shut down checks before Mega Evolving or setting up in the Sun.
    * **Butterfree:** Highly lethal due to the **Compound Eyes** ability, which boosts Sleep Powder’s accuracy from a shaky 75% to a highly reliable **97.5%**.
    * **Lilligant / Hisuian Lilligant:** Uses the move to create "setup windows" for *Quiver Dance* or *Victory Dance*.
    * **Jumpluff:** Utilizes high base Speed to land a "Fast Sleep" before the opponent can move.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely seen on non-STAB users, **Vivillon** mirrors Butterfree's strategy, using the move alongside *Compound Eyes* and *Hurricane* to dominate lower competitive tiers.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up. It is **not available as a TM or TR** in most generations, making it a specialized tool for natural learners.
