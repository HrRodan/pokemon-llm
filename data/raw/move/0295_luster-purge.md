## Identity & Mechanics
**Luster Purge** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user releases a concentrated, blinding burst of radiant psychic energy that scours the target's mind and body. This intense flash of light acts as a mental purge, overwhelming the opponent's defenses with sheer telekinetic brilliance. 
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target. It is notable for its high probability of compromising the target's defensive integrity.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s **Special Defense** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Premium STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Historically a signature move with lower power, its modern buff to **95 Power** makes it strictly superior to the standard move *Psychic* (90 Power). The massive **50% chance** to drop Special Defense makes Luster Purge an incredible tool for forcing switches; even resistant targets risk having their defenses crushed, making them vulnerable to a follow-up attack. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special attack. It is not blocked by protection like Bulletproof, but it is hindered by its extremely low PP, requiring careful management in prolonged battles.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the signature move of the Eon Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Latios** and **Mega Latios**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not used for coverage by other species. On Latios, it serves as the primary offensive tool to punish bulky Poison-types like **Toxapex** or Fighting-types like **Iron Valiant**.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely rare; it is not available via TM or TR. In most generations, it can only be accessed by Latios through leveling up or via the Move Relearner.
