## Identity & Mechanics
**Solar Blade** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user absorbs intense solar radiation, condensing the gathered light into a brilliant, razor-sharp edge of pure energy. This radiant blade is then brought down with crushing force, slicing through the opponent. As a physical counterpart to Solar Beam, it is synonymous with high-output damage under intense sunlight.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn move. The user spends the first turn charging ("gathering light") and attacks on the second turn. However, if **Harsh Sunlight** (Sun) is active, the charge turn is skipped, allowing for an immediate strike. Conversely, if Rain, Sandstorm, or Snow/Hail is active, the move's power is halved to 62.5.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. This move cannot be selected by Sleep Talk.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 125, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker (specifically on **Sun Teams**).
* **Usage:** Solar Blade is the premier Physical Grass-type move for offensive threats in the sun. It is significantly more powerful than Leaf Blade (90 BP) and Power Whip (120 BP, 85% Acc), offering perfect accuracy and massive "one-shot" potential. However, outside of Sun, it is a liability due to the charge turn and weather-based power reduction. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** In Generation IX, it is classified as a **Slicing Move**, receiving a 50% power boost from the **Sharpness** ability. Despite being a "blade" move, it notably does **not** make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), primarily given to Pokémon with blade-like appendages or those associated with light and photosynthesis.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Lurantis** (its original signature user), **Kartana** (utilizing its massive Attack stat), **Tsareena**, and **Zacian-Crowned**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Grass Pokémon that thrive in Sun or have the Sharpness ability, such as **Gallade** and **Ceruledge**, to bypass bulky Water and Ground-type checks like Dondozo or Great Tusk.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (TM12 in Sword/Shield, TM190 in Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple coverage option for physical attackers in VGC and Singles sun-based archetypes.
