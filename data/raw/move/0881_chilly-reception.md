## Identity & Mechanics
**Chilly Reception** is a Status **Ice**-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The user tells a chillingly bad joke to frost the atmosphere, summoning a **Snow** weather condition before immediately retreating to be replaced by another Pokémon in the party. This move combines weather-setting utility with tactical momentum, creating a literal and figurative cold front on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Changes the current weather to **Snow** for five turns (eight if holding an Icy Rock) and causes the user to **switch out** immediately.
* **Secondary Effect:** None; however, the summoned Snow provides a **50% Defense boost** to all Ice-type Pokémon on the field.
* **Targeting:** Affects the **Entire Field** (weather) and the **User** (switching).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Always Hits), PP 10.
* **Role:** **Pivot / Weather Setter / Momentum Generator.**
* **Usage:** Chilly Reception is considered a premier "Slow Pivot" tool. Because the primary users have naturally low Speed stats, they typically take a hit from the opponent first before using the move. This allows a frail teammate (a "Glass Cannon") to enter the field safely without taking damage, now protected by the newly summoned Snow. It is often compared to **Teleport** for its switching mechanics or **U-turn/Volt Switch**, though it lacks chip damage and cannot be blocked by Ground-types or the "Damp" ability.
* **Type Matchups:** While it deals no damage, the Snow it summons disrupts teams relying on **Sandstorm, Sun, or Rain**, effectively "checking" weather-dependent sweepers.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move (though it bypasses Substitute due to its status nature) and is classified as a switching move, meaning it fails if the user is the last conscious Pokémon in the party or is under the effect of "Ingrain."

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, acting as a signature-style move for a single evolutionary line (2 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Slowking** and **Galarian Slowking**. 
* **Tactical Utility:** In the competitive "Overused" (OU) tier, both forms of Slowking use this move to support Ice-type threats like **Baxcalibur** or **Alolan Ninetales**, or simply to disrupt the opponent's weather while pivoting to a counter. 
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally through leveling up, emphasizing its status as a specialized tactical tool.
