## Identity & Mechanics
**Floaty Fall** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* title.
* **Description:** The user magically defies gravity to float high into the air before performing a rapid, steep-angled diving strike against the opponent. This aerial maneuver combines kinetic force with a sudden descent, often startling the target.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage with a significant chance to disrupt the target's actions.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to cause the target to **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Flinch-Hax Utility.
* **Usage:** Within the context of the *Let's Go* meta, Floaty Fall serves as a premier Physical STAB option for its exclusive user. While many Flying-type moves like *Fly* require a semi-invulnerable turn or *Brave Bird* causes recoil, Floaty Fall provides high base power with a devastating flinch chance and minimal drawbacks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass**, **Fighting**, and **Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Static or Rough Skin and is affected by Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being an exclusive "Partner Move" (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, it is only learned by the **Partner Pikachu** (the starter in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!*). 
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is mechanically unique because it provides **Flying-type STAB coverage** to a pure Electric-type Pokémon. This allows Partner Pikachu to effectively counter its primary weakness—**Ground-types** (specifically Grass/Ground or Bug/Ground hybrids) and deal neutral or super-effective damage to types that usually resist its Electric attacks, such as Grass and Dragon.
* **Acquisition:** It cannot be learned via leveling up; it must be taught by a **Move Tutor** located in the Pokémon Centers of the Kanto region (specifically in Celadon City) in the *Let's Go* series.
