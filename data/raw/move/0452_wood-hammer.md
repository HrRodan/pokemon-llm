## Identity & Mechanics
**Wood Hammer** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user leverages its massive weight or rugged, timber-like anatomy to deliver a crushing blow to the target. This attack represents the pinnacle of raw physical Grass-type power, characterized by a heavy botanical impact that often leaves both the target and the user reeling from the force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant physical damage. However, the sheer force of the impact causes the user to sustain **recoil damage** equal to 1/3 (33%) of the damage dealt to the opponent.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure damage with recoil).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Wood Hammer is the Grass-type equivalent of moves like Flare Blitz or Brave Bird. It is the preferred STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for physical attackers who need maximum damage output to break through bulky Water, Ground, or Rock types. While **Power Whip** offers similar power without recoil, its lower accuracy (85%) makes Wood Hammer the more reliable, albeit self-destructive, choice for consistency. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (26 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with wood-based or "hefty" physiologies.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Torterra**, who utilizes its massive frame for STAB; **Rillaboom**, which benefits from Wood Hammer’s high base power to complement its Grassy Surge ability; and **Tapu Bulu**, which hits exceptionally hard when the move is boosted by Grassy Terrain.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mimikyu** as a high-power coverage option to surprise and OHKO bulky Ground or Water types like Great Tusk or Dondozo that might otherwise wall its Ghost/Fairy STABs. **Ogerpon** also utilizes various forms of this move to maintain offensive pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via Level-Up or through the Move Reminder; it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its distribution more exclusive than other high-power moves.
