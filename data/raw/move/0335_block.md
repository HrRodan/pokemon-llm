## Identity & Mechanics
**Block** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user strategically obstructs the target's path or surrounds them, physically preventing their retreat or recall to their Poké Ball. This move is designed for containment, forcing a specific matchup to remain active on the field, which is essential for trapping strategies and isolation tactics.
* **Effect:** The target is prevented from switching out normally. This effect persists as long as the user remains active on the field. It ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring the "trap" always lands unless the target is protected by specific moves or items.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the trapping effect is bypassed by pivoting moves (Baton Pass, U-turn, Volt Switch, Flip Turn) or if the target is holding a Shed Shell. In modern generations, Ghost-type Pokémon are naturally immune to this trapping effect.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Trapping Utility / Setup Enabler.**
* **Usage:** Block is a niche but high-impact move used to "lock" a passive opponent (such as a defensive wall or a support Pokémon) into the field. Once trapped, the user can safely use the opponent as "setup fodder" to boost stats (e.g., Curse or Calm Mind) or execute a **Perish Trap** strategy (combining Block with Perish Song). It is functionally identical to *Mean Look* and *Spider Web*.
* **Context:** Unlike damaging trapping moves (like *Magma Storm* or *Anchor Shot*), Block deals no chip damage but has the advantage of never missing. It is most effective on "Stall" or "Semi-Stall" teams.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypassed by Magic Coat and reflected by Magic Bounce.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, particularly among bulky or heavy Pokémon (142 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Snorlax**, **Garganacl**, **Toxapex**, and **Registeel**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon with high defensive utility like **Pyukumuku**, **Bastiodon**, and **Aegislash** to force an opponent to stay in while they chip away at their HP or stack hazards.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available via Move Tutors in older generations (like Emerald or Platinum) and primarily learned through leveling up in modern titles. It is rarely distributed as a TM or TR.
