## Identity & Mechanics
**Esper Wing** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII, specifically debuting in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*.
* **Description:** The user focuses psychokinetic energy into its wings, slashing the opponent with blades of aura-enriched feathers. This aerial assault combines mental discipline with physical grace, creating a shimmering psychic edge that cuts through defenses. In standard battle mechanics, this move propels the user forward, increasing their momentum and reaction time.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the user's Speed stat by one stage. It also possesses a heightened critical-hit ratio (increased by 1 stage).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the user's Speed; High Critical Hit Ratio.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Setup Sweeper.
* **Usage:** While its base power is slightly lower than *Psychic* (90), Esper Wing is superior for offensive pressure due to its guaranteed Speed boost and high crit rate. It functions similarly to moves like *Torch Song* or *Fiery Dance*, allowing the user to "snowball" by becoming faster with every successful hit. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** contact-based despite the flavor text (it is Special), and it is not blocked by *Bulletproof*.
