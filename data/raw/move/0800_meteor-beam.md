## Identity & Mechanics
**Meteor Beam** is a Special Rock-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user focuses celestial energy, drawing power from the cosmos or surrounding atmosphere to significantly bolster its mental focus. On the second turn, it releases this concentrated "space power" as a devastating, high-velocity beam of astral energy.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn move. On the first turn, the user gathers energy and automatically raises its Special Attack stat by one stage. On the second turn, the user deals damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the user's **Special Attack** by one stage (occurs on the charging turn).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Setup Sweeper.
* **Usage:** Meteor Beam is almost exclusively paired with the **Power Herb** hold item. This allows the user to bypass the charging turn, delivering a massive 120-power hit instantly while gaining a +1 Special Attack boost. It serves as a "Special Rock-type Z-Move" that facilitates a sweep. It is the premier choice for Special attackers requiring Rock-type coverage, as its only rival, Power Gem, lacks significant base power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-distance (Non-contact).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (110 learners), particularly among Rock-types, extraterrestrial Pokémon, and those associated with ancient or crystalline structures.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Nihilego**, **Glimmora**, and **Minior**. These Pokémon leverage their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and high Special Attack to force switches or secure KOs while boosting.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon like **Eternatus** and **Iron Moth** to counter Fire and Flying-type threats (such as Ho-Oh or Moltres) that would otherwise wall their primary STAB moves. It is also a niche option for **Starmie** and **Lunala**.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in the *Sword & Shield* Isle of Armor DLC; it returned as **TM190** in *Scarlet & Violet* (The Indigo Disk).
