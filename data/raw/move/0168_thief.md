## Identity & Mechanics
**Thief** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user lunges at the target with a cunning, opportunistic strike, focusing more on the opponent's belongings than raw force. If the strike connects, the user snatches the target's held item and keeps it for the remainder of the battle.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is holding an item and the user is not, the user steals the item. The theft is permanent for the duration of the match (unless in specific competitive formats where items reset).
* **Secondary Effect:** No status or stat changes; however, it fails to steal items from Pokémon with the **Sticky Hold** ability or those holding "locked" items like Mega Stones, Z-Crystals, or Orbs held by Giratina/Arceus (**Multitype**).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 25 (Max 40).
* **Role:** Disruptive Utility / Item Control.
* **Usage:** While historically used for item disruption, it is largely outclassed by *Knock Off* in most competitive formats due to the latter's higher power and ability to remove items regardless of whether the user is holding one. **Thief** sees niche play on "itemless" sets or Pokémon utilizing consumables like **Focus Sash** or **Unburden** (e.g., Hawlucha), allowing them to steal a replacement item after their own is consumed. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution, being one of the most common utility moves in the game (561 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) users such as **Meowscarada**, **Grimmsnarl**, and **Weavile**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Gengar**, **Dragapult**, and **Ambipom**. Fast, frail attackers often use it to replenish their utility after a Focus Sash has been triggered.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in almost every generation, making it a staple for in-game item farming (e.g., stealing Heart Scales or Lucky Eggs from wild Pokémon).
