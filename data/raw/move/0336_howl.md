## Identity & Mechanics
**Howl** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user lets out a long, rallying cry that bolsters its fighting spirit and physical resolve. As a vocalization-based move, it serves as a pack-wide signal to increase offensive pressure, making it a thematic staple for canine and lupine Pokémon. 
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Attack stat by one stage (+1). Starting in Generation VIII, this move's effectiveness was expanded to also raise the Attack stat of any active allies.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User and Allies (Modern) / User (Legacy).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Setup / Utility Support.
* **Usage:** In Singles, Howl is typically considered a niche setup move, often outclassed by **Swords Dance** (+2 Attack) or **Dragon Dance** (+1 Attack, +1 Speed). However, its value peaks in **VGC and Double Battles**, where it functions as a "Spread Buff," allowing a support Pokémon to increase the damage output of a powerful physical sweeper partner. It deals **Neutral** utility to all types but is hard-countered by the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based move (can be blocked by Soundproof; bypasses Substitute in certain generations).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (46 learners), almost exclusively limited to beast-like or canine-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by legendary powerhouses like **Zacian (Crowned)** and **Zamazenta**, as well as common physical threats like **Lycanroc (all forms)** and **Arcanine**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Scream Tail** or **Manectric** in supportive roles to provide offensive pressure for their teammates.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up; it is not commonly distributed as a TM or TR, making it a signature trait of specific "pack-hunter" archetypes.
