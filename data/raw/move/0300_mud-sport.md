## Identity & Mechanics
**Mud Sport** is a Status Ground-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user vigorously kicks up or coats itself in a thick, insulating layer of damp mud. This wet earth acts as a natural grounding agent, significantly dampening the conductivity of the immediate area and absorbing electrical discharges before they can reach their full potential.
* **Effect:** While the user is active on the field, the power of Electric-type moves is reduced by 50% (effectively halved) for all Pokémon currently in battle. This effect is a field-state mechanic that immediately terminates if the user switches out or is fainted.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Entire field (affects all active Pokémon, but tied to the user's presence).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Niche Utility / Defensive Support.
* **Usage:** Mud Sport is rarely seen in high-level competitive play as it is generally outclassed by switching to a Ground-type Pokémon, which possesses a natural immunity to Electric-type attacks. Its primary use-case is in Double Battles to protect a Water or Flying-type partner from STAB Electric nukes. It is the Ground-type counterpart to **Water Sport**. It mitigates damage from **Electric**-type moves.
* **Attributes:** Field-effect move; does not make contact; bypasses accuracy checks.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily found among Pokémon associated with wetlands, swamps, or rocky terrain.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by Water/Ground "Mud Boys" such as **Swampert**, **Quagsire**, and **Gastrodon**, as well as sturdy Rock/Ground types like **Golem**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon with a crippling 4x weakness to Electric moves, such as **Pelipper** (via Egg Move) or **Mantine**, to serve as a desperate defensive measure.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up; it is notably absent from **TM/TR** lists in most generations, making it a specialized move inherited through breeding or natural progression.
