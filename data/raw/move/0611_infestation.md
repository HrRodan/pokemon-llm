## Identity & Mechanics
**Infestation** is a Special Bug-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user summons a swarming cloud of insects, parasites, or dark energy to surround and overwhelm the target. This relentless swarm prevents the opponent from retreating while slowly draining their vitality through constant, irritating contact. In a RAG context, this move is defined by its **trapping** and **residual damage** properties.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage upon use. For the next 2–5 turns, the target is "Infested," meaning they are **prevented from switching out or fleeing**. Additionally, the target loses **1/8th** (standard in later gens) or **1/16th** of their maximum HP at the end of each turn. The effect ends if the user leaves the field or if the target uses **Rapid Spin** or **Substitute**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to initiate the Trapping/Binding status.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Utility / Trapper / Stall-breaker.**
* **Usage:** Unlike high-damage Bug moves like *U-turn* or *Bug Buzz*, Infestation is used for **Tactical Trapping**. It is a cornerstone of "Perish Song" or "Toxic Stall" strategies, as it prevents the opponent from switching to a counter while they succumb to passive damage. It is often compared to **Magma Storm** (Heatran's signature) or **Whirlpool**, but with a 100% accuracy rate, making it more reliable for defensive Pokémon. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses most protection-based stat drops due to its focus on residual damage rather than raw power.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (129 learners), making it a common utility option for many defensive or "annoyer" archetypes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Shuckle** (the "Infestation/Toxic/Sticky Web" set), **Toxapex** (to trap and out-stall regenerators), and **Quagsire/Gastrodon** (to lock in opponents while setting up).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Bug Pokémon like **Goodra**, **Dragapult**, and **Mimikyu** to trap specific counters or force progress against defensive walls. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM83** in Generation VI and **TM20** in Generation VII; it remains a staple in the movepools of many "creepy-crawly" or swamp-dwelling Pokémon.
