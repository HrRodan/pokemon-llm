## Identity & Mechanics
**Megahorn** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user charges at the target with massive physical force, using a large, sharpened horn, tusk, or antler to impale and overwhelm the opponent. It is characterized by brute strength and momentum, often visually depicted as a high-velocity collision. This move is the pinnacle of Bug-type physical power, sacrificing pinpoint accuracy for devastating impact.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage to a single target. It does not have any additional secondary effects, focusing entirely on raw damage output.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 85%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Megahorn is the strongest Bug-type move in the game (excluding Z-Moves or Max Moves). It is the primary choice for Physical Bug-type attackers looking to maximize damage. While it is significantly more powerful than **X-Scissor** (80 Power) or **Leech Life** (80 Power), its 85% accuracy makes it a "shakey" option that can lead to costly misses in high-stakes turns. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass**, **Psychic**, and **Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move; it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, and Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (45 learners), primarily granted to Pokémon with prominent horns or tusks.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Heracross**, which frequently uses it as its primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) nuke. Other major users include **Escavalier**, **Scolipede**, and **Galarian Rapidash**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized as a "coverage" move by non-Bug Pokémon to threaten Psychic and Dark-type walls. Notable examples include **Nidoking**, **Rhyperior**, **Great Tusk**, and **Iron Treads**. It is also a rare high-power physical option for certain Legendaries like **Xerneas** and **Calyrex-Ice**.
* **Acquisition:** While it was a signature move for Heracross in Gen II, it has since become more accessible via **TR28** in Generation VIII and various Move Tutors in other generations.
