## Identity & Mechanics
**Water Pledge** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user summons a localized, pressurized column of water to erupt beneath the target. While effective as a standalone strike, it is designed for elemental synchronicity; when cast in tandem with its Fire or Grass counterparts, the water fuses with the other element to create powerful, field-wide atmospheric effects.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. Its true power lies in its **Combo Mechanics**:
    * **Water + Grass (Swamp):** Creates a swamp on the opponent's side for 4 turns, reducing their Speed by 75%.
    * **Water + Fire (Rainbow):** Creates a rainbow on the user’s side for 4 turns, doubling the secondary effect chances of all moves (effectively granting the team *Serene Grace*).
    * When combined, the second mover’s power increases to **150**.
* **Secondary Effect:** No innate secondary effect unless used in a combination.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Synergy-Based Tech / Double Battle Utility.**
* **Usage:** In Single Battles, Water Pledge is generally outclassed by *Surf* (higher power) or *Scald* (burn utility). However, in **Double Battles (VGC)**, it is a specialized tool for "Pledge Teams." The **Rainbow** effect is particularly devastating when paired with moves like *Iron Head* (flinch) or *Rock Slide*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by Iron Barbs or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow, specialized distribution (36 total learners), restricted almost entirely to **Starter Pokémon** and "Omni-learners."
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Water-type starters such as **Blastoise**, **Swampert**, **Greninja**, **Primarina**, and **Inteleon**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Rarely used for coverage due to its exclusive distribution, though **Mew** and **Silvally** can utilize it to bridge elemental gaps in specialized double-battle strategies. 
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught via a Move Tutor (the "Pledge Tutor") in most regions; it is available via **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
