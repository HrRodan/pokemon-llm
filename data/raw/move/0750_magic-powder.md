## Identity & Mechanics
**Magic Powder** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user exhales or scatters a shimmering, mystical cloud of iridescent dust that blankets the target. This magical substance permeates the opponent's essence, temporarily overwriting their elemental composition and forcing them to become a pure Psychic-type Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Changes the target's type to Psychic. This effect replaces all of the target's current types.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the type-change).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Type-Changing Utility / Defensive Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Magic Powder functions as a Psychic-type variant of the move *Soak*. It is primarily used to strip an opponent of their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) or to remove dangerous defensive typings (such as turning a Steel/Toxapex wall into a pure Psychic-type). By forcing the Psychic type onto an opponent, the user makes them vulnerable to **Bug, Ghost, and Dark** type attacks.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Powder-based move**. As such, it is ineffective against Grass-type Pokémon, Pokémon with the *Overcoat* ability, or those holding the *Safety Goggles* item. It is also blocked by *Substitute*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, being the signature move of a single evolutionary line (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Hatterene** (and its pre-evolutions Hatenna and Hattrem). 
* **Coverage Utility:** While Hatterene itself is a Psychic/Fairy type, it uses Magic Powder to bypass its own checks. By turning a Steel-type or Poison-type switch-in into a Psychic-type, Hatterene can then hit them for neutral damage or set up a teammate to land a Super Effective Dark or Ghost-type "Nuke."
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned strictly through leveling up within the Hatterene line.
