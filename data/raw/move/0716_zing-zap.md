## Identity & Mechanics
**Zing Zap** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user generates a sudden, high-voltage electrical surge and crashes into the target with full physical force. This violent discharge of electricity not only shocks the opponent but often causes them to hesitate or recoil from the impact. As a physical contact move, it utilizes the user's Attack stat and is themed around a "crash" or "blast" of kinetic energy combined with sparks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and possesses a high probability of interrupting the target's action.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**, provided the user moves first.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Flinch-Fisher.
* **Usage:** Zing Zap is often considered the "Electric-type Iron Head." In competitive play, it is highly valued as a Physical Electric STAB move because it lacks the recoil damage of *Wild Charge* and has higher base power than *Thunder Punch*. Its 30% flinch chance makes it a potent tool for "Para-Flinch" strategies when combined with Speed control or Paralysis. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution (3-4 learners), making it a rare and specialized move.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Togedemaru**, which uses its *Lightning Rod* or *Iron Barbs* abilities to complement its physical Electric toolkit. It is also a staple move for **Pincurchin** (the Electric Surge setter) and **Pawmot** (Gen IX), the latter of which leverages its high Speed to abuse the flinch chance.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as a coverage move on non-Electric types. It is almost exclusively found on Pokémon that receive **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) from it.
* **Acquisition:** Originally the signature move of Togedemaru; it is not available as a TM or TR in most generations, though it was added to the movepools of specific physical attackers in later games.
