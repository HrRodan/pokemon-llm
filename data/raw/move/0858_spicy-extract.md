## Identity & Mechanics
**Spicy Extract** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user secretes and emits a concentrated, volatile capsaicin-based essence or oil. This incredibly spicy extract triggers an intense physical reaction in the target, causing an adrenaline-fueled surge in power at the cost of physical vulnerability. As a non-damaging Grass-type move, it represents the botanical chemical warfare unique to pepper-based flora.
* **Effect:** Simultaneously increases the target's **Attack stat by two stages (+2)** and decreases the target's **Defense stat by two stages (-2)**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The stat changes are the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Can target an adjacent foe or a teammate in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Stat Manipulator / Offensive Support.**
* **Usage:** Spicy Extract is a high-utility signature move with a "high-risk, high-reward" profile. In **Singles**, it is primarily used as a **Wallbreaking** tool to soften a defensive foe, though it carries the risk of allowing the opponent to hit back much harder. In **Doubles**, it functions as a potent **Partner Buffer**; when used on an ally with the *Clear Body* or *White Smoke* ability (or holding a *Clear Amolet*), the ally gains the +2 Attack boost while ignoring the Defense drop. It also has niche synergy with the ability **Contrary**, where it would instead lower Attack and raise Defense.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage, but it is notably **not a powder-based move**, meaning it can affect Grass-types and Overcoat users who are usually immune to "spore" or "powder" utility moves.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy and checks for protection/substitute normally.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, the only Pokémon capable of learning this move is **Scovillain**. It perfectly complements Scovillain’s dual Fire/Grass typing and its thematic identity as a spicy habanero-based creature.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is limited to Scovillain, it is rarely seen as a "coverage" option, but rather as a specific gimmick or tactical choice in VGC (Doubles) formats to enable physical sweepers.
* **Acquisition:** Available only via level-up for Scovillain; it is not available as a TM or TR.
