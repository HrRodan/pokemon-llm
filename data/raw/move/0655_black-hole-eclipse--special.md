## Identity & Mechanics
**Black Hole Eclipse (Special)** is a Special Dark-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user gathers an immense amount of Z-Power, creating a localized singularity of absolute darkness. It manifests as a crushing black hole that sucks the target into a void before collapsing in a violent explosion of shadow energy. This move is optimized for bypassing traditional evasion and securing KOs through overwhelming gravitational force.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used once per battle. It deals massive damage based on the power of the original base move. Crucially, Z-Moves like Black Hole Eclipse bypass accuracy checks, meaning they cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig).
* **Secondary Effect:** If the target uses *Protect* or *Detect*, this move still deals 25% of its original damage. It has no additional status-inducing effects but functions as a pure offensive nuke.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Powered Z-Move Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats (SM/USUM) to allow Special Attackers to punch through specially defensive walls or "checkmate" a specific threat. It is the ultimate tool for Dark-type Special attackers to overcome high-HP targets that might otherwise survive a standard Dark Pulse. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Requires the user to hold **Darkinium Z** and know a damaging Special Dark-type move (e.g., Dark Pulse, Snarl). It is not affected by "contact" or "sound-based" mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Z-Move, its distribution is functionally **Universal** for any Pokémon capable of learning a Special Dark-type move.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Hydreigon:** Frequently used Darkinium Z alongside *Dark Pulse* to turn into a terrifying wallbreaker, capable of OHKOing many neutral threats.
    * **Darkrai:** Utilizes its high Special Attack to delete targets that survive its usual sleep-and-hit tactics.
    * **Yveltal (Ubers):** In the Ubers tier, a Dark Aura-boosted Black Hole Eclipse is one of the most powerful Special attacks in the game.
    * **Hoopa-Unbound:** An elite Special attacker that uses this move to bypass its relatively lower speed by ensuring whatever it hits is eliminated.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Gengar** or **Lunala** when running Dark Pulse to surprise and eliminate opposing Ghost or Psychic-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII via the **Darkinium Z** Crystal; the move's power is determined by the base Special move it upgrades from.
