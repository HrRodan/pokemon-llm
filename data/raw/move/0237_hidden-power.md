## Identity & Mechanics
**Hidden Power** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation II. 
* **Description:** This move taps into a Pokémon's latent elemental potential, manifesting as a beam of energy whose properties are unique to the individual. Because its type and power are derived from the user's Individual Values (IVs), it serves as a versatile, type-shifting strike that allows almost any Pokémon to bypass its natural movepool limitations.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage using a type determined by the user's IVs. While technically listed as a Normal-type move, it cannot actually be Normal-type in practice (it covers all types from Fighting to Dark; notably, it cannot be Fairy-type).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Universal Coverage** / **Lure**.
* **Usage:** Hidden Power is one of the most significant moves in competitive history. Its primary function is to provide **Coverage** for Special attackers who are otherwise walled by specific threats. For example, a Grass-type might carry *Hidden Power Fire* to surprise an incoming Steel-type. In formats before Generation VIII, it was a mandatory "Lure" tool used to "check-mate" specific counters. It deals **Super Effective** damage to targets based on the specific IV-bred type (most commonly Fire, Ice, Grass, or Ground).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses many natural resistances; its power was variable (30-70) in earlier generations but was standardized to 60 in Generation VI.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an immense distribution, being one of the most widely available moves in the franchise (**944 learners**).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Magnezone:** Famously utilizes *Hidden Power Fire* in conjunction with its *Magnet Pull* ability to trap and eliminate Steel-types like Ferrothorn and Scizor.
    * **Zapdos:** Frequently runs *Hidden Power Ice* to threaten 4x effective damage against Ground/Flying or Dragon/Ground threats like Landorus-Therian and Garchomp.
    * **Serperior:** Often relies on *Hidden Power Fire* or *Hidden Power Ground* to prevent Steel-types from completely halting its *Contrary* Leaf Storm sweep.
    * **Latios/Latias:** Historically used various types (Fire, Fighting, or Ground) to break through dedicated Special walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** Essential for **Special Sweepers** with shallow movepools (like Jolteon or Espeon) to ensure they aren't completely walled by a single type.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM10** in almost every generation from Gen II through Gen VII. It was notably removed from the movepool of most Pokémon in Generations VIII and IX.
