## Identity & Mechanics
**Disarming Voice** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user lets out a charming, high-pitched, and endearing cry that inflicts emotional distress on the target. This melodic resonance vibrates through the air, ensuring the attack reaches the opponent regardless of their physical positioning or attempts to hide. As a sound-based move, it is capable of penetrating through a target's **Substitute**.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to hit the target, bypassing all accuracy checks and evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** All opponents (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy —%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Utility.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the early stages of a playthrough or by Pokémon with specific abilities that augment sound-based moves. In competitive play, it is largely outclassed by **Dazzling Gleam** (for spread damage) or **Moonblast** (for raw power). However, its "never-miss" mechanic makes it a niche counter to "Double Team" or "Minimize" strategies. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute; blocked by Soundproof; triggers Liquid Voice/Punk Rock).
