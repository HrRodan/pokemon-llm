## Identity & Mechanics
**Chloroblast** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user harnesses its internal reserves of botanical energy, launching an explosive discharge of amassed chlorophyll at the target. This high-intensity blast produces a massive shockwave of floral power, though the sheer force of the eruption causes significant strain and damage to the user's own body.
* **Effect:** The user attacks the target with massive power. In standard battle mechanics (Gen IX), the user sustains recoil damage equal to **50% of its maximum HP** (rounded up). In *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it also lowers the user's action speed.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The HP loss is a primary mechanical cost, not a percentage-based secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 95%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Chloroblast is the Grass-type equivalent of moves like *Mind Blown* or *Steel Beam*. It is designed for maximum immediate damage, often used to secure a crucial OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) at the cost of the user's longevity. It is significantly more powerful than *Leaf Storm* and does not lower Special Attack, but the 50% HP recoil makes it a "last resort" or a suicide-lead tool. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special projectile. Because of the 95% accuracy, it carries a slight risk of missing, which can be devastating given the move's high stakes.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is the **Signature Move** of a specific regional form (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, the only Pokémon capable of learning this move is **Hisuian Electrode**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. On Hisuian Electrode, it provides a massive **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)** nuke that complements its incredible Speed tier, allowing it to act as a potent "Revenge Killer" or a dedicated lead that can "self-destruct" while dealing massive damage to the opponent.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for other species; it is learned naturally by Hisuian Electrode.
