## Identity & Mechanics
**Horn Drill** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses its energy into a pointed horn, rotating it at high speeds to create a powerful drilling motion that pierces the target. As a "One-Hit KO" (OHKO) move, it represents the pinnacle of high-risk, high-reward gameplay, visually characterized by a spinning, penetrating strike that bypasses conventional durability.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage exactly equal to the target's maximum HP, resulting in an immediate faint. The move ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers (such as Double Team or Sand Attack). Accuracy is calculated as 30% + 1% for every level the user is above the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** This move will **fail automatically** if the user’s level is lower than the target’s level.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [OHKO], Accuracy 30%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Stallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Horn Drill is primarily used as a "gimmick" or a last-resort tool to remove defensive walls that a Pokémon cannot otherwise damage. In competitive formats where OHKO moves are permitted (such as Battle Stadium Singles), it is a terrifying "coin-flip" move. It is often compared to **Guillotine** (Normal), **Fissure** (Ground), and **Sheer Cold** (Ice/Special). Notably, as a Normal-type move, it provides no offensive coverage against **Ghost-type** Pokémon, who are completely immune to it.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (24 total learners), typically restricted to Pokémon possessing prominent horns or drill-like appendages.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Nidoking**, **Rhyperior**, and **Excadrill**, all of whom can use their physical bulk to survive long enough to attempt the 30% accuracy check. **Tauros** and **Rapidash** are also classic users from the Kanto era.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Lapras** or **Seaking** in restricted formats to provide a win condition against bulky Water-type mirrors or Special walls. **Dragonite** and **Mew** have historical access to the move but rarely utilize it over more reliable coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM07** in Generation I (Red/Blue/Yellow). In modern generations, it is significantly rarer, often restricted to specific level-up pools or Egg Moves.
