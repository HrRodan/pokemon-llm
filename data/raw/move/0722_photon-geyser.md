## Identity & Mechanics
**Photon Geyser** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** The user concentrates prismatic light energy and erupts it into a massive, searing pillar of light beneath the target. This move is the signature technique of the Prism Pokémon, Necrozma, representing its ability to manipulate light and energy on a solar scale.
* **Effect:** This move inflicts damage based on the user's **Attack or Sp. Atk stat—whichever is higher**. Additionally, this move **ignores the target’s Ability** that would otherwise affect the damage or execution of the move (functioning like Mold Breaker, Teravolt, or Turboblaze).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (but bypasses defensive abilities).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Adaptive Nuke / Reliability STAB.
* **Usage:** Photon Geyser is an elite-tier STAB move. Its unique "adaptive" damage calculation allows Necrozma to function as a devastating **Mixed Attacker**, punishing opponents regardless of whether Necrozma is in its Physical-leaning Dusk Mane form or Special-leaning Dawn Wings/Ultra forms. It is significantly more powerful than *Psychic* and more versatile than *Psyshock*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Abilities (ignores Unaware, Multiscale, Sturdy, etc.). When used by Ultra Necrozma holding Ultranecrozium Z, it can be upgraded into the catastrophic Z-Move: **Light That Burns the Sky**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution, being a Signature Move (4 total forms of one Pokémon).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Necrozma**, **Necrozma-Dusk Mane** (Physical variant), **Necrozma-Dawn Wings** (Special variant), and **Ultra Necrozma**.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move for a legendary Pokémon, it is not found on other species. It is essential for Necrozma to bypass defensive walls like **Lugia** (Multiscale) or **Clefable** (Unaware) due to its built-in Mold Breaker effect.
* **Acquisition:** Only available to Necrozma through leveling up; it cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor to other Pokémon.
