## Identity & Mechanics
**Double Team** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user creates illusory copies of itself by moving at extreme speeds, producing shimmering afterimages that confuse the opponent's aim. This visual displacement makes it significantly harder for the target to land a successful hit, effectively turning the user into a blurring phantom on the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Evasion stat by one stage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Setup / Evasion-Tanking.
* **Usage:** Double Team is the quintessential "Evasion Cheese" move. By increasing Evasion, the user forces the opponent to rely on RNG to land attacks. It is often paired with **Substitute** and **Leftovers** to create a "Sub-Seed" or "Toxic Stall" win condition. In official Smogon formats, this move is frequently **Banned** under the "Evasion Clause" due to its ability to remove skill-based play. Its main rival is **Minimize**, which raises Evasion by two stages but is much rarer and makes the user take double damage from moves like Stomp.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses protection if the user targets itself; categorized as a non-contact status move.

* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to speed-based Pokémon and ninjas, such as **Pikachu**, **Greninja**, **Mewtwo**, and **Sceptile**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a coverage move in terms of damage, it is utilized by defensively oriented threats like **Blissey** or **Shuckle** in casual or unrestricted play to become nearly untouchable while chip damage (like Sandstorm or Poison) wears down the foe.
* **Acquisition:** Historically one of the most consistent **TMs** in the series (TM32 in many generations), available as a technical machine in almost every game from Red/Blue through Ultra Sun/Moon.
