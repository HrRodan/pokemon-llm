## Identity & Mechanics
**Sticky Web** is a status Bug-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user weaves and spreads a massive, adhesive silken net across the opponent's side of the battlefield. This move creates a persistent entry hazard that remains until cleared, designed to ensnare and slow down any grounded opponent that attempts to enter the fray.
* **Effect:** Sets an entry hazard on the opponent's side of the field. Any Pokémon switching in has its **Speed lowered by one stage**. This effect only applies to "grounded" Pokémon; Flying-types, Pokémon with the Levitate ability, or those holding an Air Balloon are immune.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The Speed drop is a primary effect of the hazard). 
* **Targeting:** Opponents' Field (Entry Hazard).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Entry Hazard / Speed Control / Utility.
* **Usage:** Sticky Web is the cornerstone of the **Hyper Offense (HO)** archetype. Unlike Stealth Rock or Spikes which chip away at HP, Sticky Web provides invaluable Speed control, allowing mid-speed "Wallbreakers" to outspeed and "Nuke" faster threats. It is often countered by **Defog** (which clears it from both sides) or **Rapid Spin** (which clears it from the user's side). Pokémon with the **Magic Bounce** ability (like Hatterene or Mega Diancie) will reflect the web back onto the user's side.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; susceptible to Magic Coat and Magic Bounce. It does not deal direct damage, so Bug-type effectiveness is irrelevant to its placement.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (21 total learners), primarily limited to arachnid and insect-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Shuckle:** The premier "Hazard Lead" due to its immense defenses and access to both Stealth Rock and Sticky Web.
    * **Galvantula:** A popular lead that uses its high speed to set the web early and pressure opponents with Compound Eyes-boosted Thunders.
    * **Ribombee:** Currently one of the fastest Sticky Web setters in the game, often used in higher competitive tiers to ensure the web is set before being Taunted or knocked out.
    * **Araquanid:** A bulky setter that provides defensive utility alongside its hazard-setting capabilities.
* **Coverage Utility:** While mostly found on Bug-types, **Slurpuff** is a notable non-Bug user that has historically used the move on specialized Fairy-type or unburden-based teams.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is highly restricted; it is not available as a TM or TR in most generations, making its users very predictable in the team preview phase.
