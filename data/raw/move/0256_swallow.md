## Identity & Mechanics
**Swallow** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The Pokémon internalizes the energy it has previously gathered through accumulation, converting stored potential into physical restoration. This process allows the user to mend its wounds and recover stamina instantly, though it depletes the protective energy barrier and concentrated power built up during the preparation phase.
* **Effect:** Heals the user based on the number of **Stockpile** counts currently active. It restores 25% HP at one count, 50% HP at two counts, and 100% (Full) HP at three counts. Upon use, the energy is consumed, and any Defense or Special Defense boosts gained from Stockpile are reset to normal.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The move fails if the user has not used Stockpile).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Setup-Dependent Recovery / Gimmick Sustain.
* **Usage:** Swallow is a niche recovery option that is generally considered a **High-Risk Utility** move. In competitive play, it is almost universally outclassed by "Instant Recovery" moves like *Recover*, *Roost*, or *Soft-Boiled* because Swallow requires at least one turn of setup (Stockpile) to function. Furthermore, because it resets the defensive buffs provided by Stockpile, it often leaves the user vulnerable the moment it heals. It is primarily seen in "Stockpile-Spit Up-Swallow" gimmick sets or on defensive Pokémon that lack more reliable recovery options.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails if the user is under the effect of *Heal Block*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (49 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with "consuming" or "storing" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Snorlax**, **Pelipper**, **Swalot**, and **Cramorant**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Ultra Beasts like **Guzzlord** or defensive tanks like **Quagsire** (Paldean Wooper) and **Garbodor** to provide a massive burst of healing in lower-tier formats where they can safely stack boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up; it is notably absent from TM/TR lists in most generations, making it a "natural" move for specific species.
