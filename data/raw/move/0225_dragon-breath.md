## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Breath** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user exhales a concentrated, mystical blast of draconic energy or intense heat at the target. This gaseous projection is imbued with a paralyzing aura that can seize the opponent’s nervous system or muscles upon contact, making it a potent tool for speed control.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a high probability of inducing the Paralysis status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to Paralyze the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility Chip / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low compared to heavy-hitters like **Dragon Pulse** (85 BP) or the devastating **Draco Meteor** (130 BP), Dragon Breath is valued for its 30% paralysis rate—the same as *Body Slam*. It is often utilized in mid-game transitions to cripple faster sweepers or in lower-tier competitive formats where its utility outweighs raw damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, breath-based special attack. It is notable for being one of the few ways Dragon-types could fish for status in earlier generations.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (91 learners), being a staple early-to-mid-level move for nearly all draconic species.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Dragonite**, **Altaria**, **Latios**, and **Latias**. It is also a signature part of the movepools for box legendaries like **Dialga**, **Palkia**, and **Giratina**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen as a flavor or utility option on non-Dragon Pokémon such as **Gyarados**, **Milotic**, and **Arcanine** to provide neutral coverage against most types.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available as TM24 in Generation II (Gold/Silver/Crystal), it has since transitioned primarily to a natural level-up move for the majority of Dragon-type evolutionary lines.
