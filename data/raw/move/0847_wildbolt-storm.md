## Identity & Mechanics
**Wildbolt Storm** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user manifests a violent, localized hurricane infused with high-voltage electricity, striking the battlefield with a combination of gale-force winds and devastating lightning bolts. As a "Storm" series signature move, it represents the raw elemental fury of the clouds.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to the target. In Double Battles, this move targets **all adjacent opponents** without damaging the user's ally. Under the effect of **Rain**, this move bypasses accuracy checks to hit 100% of the time.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to inflict **Paralysis** on the target(s).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 80%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Spread Nuke / Weather-Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Wildbolt Storm serves as a higher-power alternative to *Thunderbolt* and a more reliable alternative to *Thunder* (outside of rain). Its primary value lies in **VGC (Doubles)**, where its ability to hit both opponents while maintaining a high Paralysis chance makes it a significant threat. It is the premier choice for **Rain Teams**, as the 100% accuracy in Rain mitigates its primary drawback. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a Wind-based move (interacts with the Wind Power or Wind Rider abilities). It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (2 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Thundurus (Incarnate Forme)** and **Thundurus (Therian Forme)**. Both forms utilize this move as their primary Special STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option in high-level competitive play.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on non-Electric types. However, **Thundurus-Therian** frequently uses it to break through bulky Water-types like *Dofin* or *Pelipper* and Flying-types like *Corviknight*.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned through leveling up by the Forces of Nature trio (specifically Thundurus).
