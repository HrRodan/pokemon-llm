## Identity & Mechanics
**Genesis Supernova** is a Special Psychic-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun and Moon).
* **Description:** After obtaining Z-Power through a Mewnium Z, the user, Mew, compresses celestial energy into a massive, shimmering orb before detonating it upon the target. The resulting explosion is so powerful that it floods the entire battlefield with psychic energy, altering the environment itself. This move is the ultimate expression of Mew's genetic potential and cosmic origin.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage and immediately activates **Psychic Terrain** for five turns (eight if the user holds a Terrain Extender, though Z-Moves consume the item slot).
* **Secondary Effect:** Automatically sets Psychic Terrain upon successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 185, Accuracy --% (Never-miss), PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Powered Nuke / Field-Setting Utility.
* **Usage:** Primarily used as a "Wallbreaker" tool that provides immediate board control. Unlike the generic Psychic Z-Move *Shattered Psyche*, Genesis Supernova guarantees the setup of Psychic Terrain. This provides a 1.3x boost (1.5x in Gen 7) to Psychic-type moves and, more importantly, **protects grounded Pokémon from priority moves** like Sucker Punch, Extreme Speed, and Fake Out. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a Signature Z-Move requiring the move **Psychic** and the held item **Mewnium Z**. As a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy checks and ignores protection effects (though damage is reduced to 25%).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Unique/Exclusive** distribution, as it is a signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Only **Mew** can utilize this move. Mew’s access to a wide array of support moves (like Nasty Plot or Calm Mind) allows it to use Genesis Supernova to secure a KO and then sweep or support the team under the safety of Psychic Terrain.
* **Coverage Utility:** As this move is exclusive to Mew, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. However, the resulting Psychic Terrain benefits teammates like **Tapu Lele** (by refreshing terrain) or **Alakazam** (by boosting STAB damage).
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Mewnium Z** Crystal, which was originally distributed via the Pokémon Bank event in early 2017 for Gen VII games.
