## Identity & Mechanics
**Simple Beam** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user emits a mysterious, undulating wave of psychic-like energy that rewires the target’s physiological traits. This rhythmic beam suppresses the target's natural talents and replaces them with the **Simple** ability, causing their stat fluctuations to become twice as effective.
* **Effect:** Changes the target’s current Ability to **Simple**. This effect lasts until the target switches out or the battle ends. It fails against Pokémon with abilities that cannot be replaced (e.g., Multitype, Stance Change, or Schooling).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Disruptor / Enabler.
* **Usage:** Simple Beam serves a dual-purpose in competitive play. **Offensively**, it is used as a "Check" to neutralize top-tier threats by overwriting dangerous abilities like *Huge Power*, *Wonder Guard*, or *Intimidate*. **Supportively**, it is a niche pick in Doubles formats where a user hits their own ally to turn them into a "Setup Sweeper," doubling the impact of moves like *Calm Mind* or *Swords Dance*. While it competes with *Entrainment* and *Gastro Acid*, Simple Beam is unique because it can technically "buff" a teammate significantly more than its rivals.
* **Attributes:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and therefore does not trigger contact-based effects or Type Matchup multipliers. It can affect Ghost-type Pokémon despite being a Normal-type move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (16 learners), primarily found among Psychic-types or Pokémon with high utility.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Latios**, **Genesect**, and **Audino** (including Mega Audino). **Swoobat** is also a notable thematic user.
* **Coverage Utility:** In higher-tier play, **Genesect** and **Latios** can use this move to disrupt defensive walls that rely on their abilities to survive (e.g., overwriting a Pokémon's *Unaware* or *Multiscale*).
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is highly restricted; it is not available as a TM or TR in any generation, making it a rare "Egg Move" or high-level "Level Up" move for its specific learner pool.
