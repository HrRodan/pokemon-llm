## Identity & Mechanics
**Seed Flare** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy to generate a massive, purifying shock wave of organic power. This botanical explosion manifests as a blinding flare of seeds and floral essence that overwhelms the target with nature's raw vitality. It is designed for maximum damage output and tactical disruption.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-magnitude Special damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a significant **40% chance** to lower the target’s Special Defense by **two stages** (-2 Sp. Def).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 85%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** As a signature move, Seed Flare is one of the most threatening Grass-type attacks in the game. While it shares the power level of *Hydro Pump* or *Fire Blast*, its secondary effect is arguably the most potent for a damaging move. A -2 Sp. Def drop essentially doubles the damage the target takes from Special attacks on the following turn, forcing immediate switches. It is often compared to *Leaf Storm*; while *Leaf Storm* has slightly higher base power (130), it lowers the user's stats, whereas Seed Flare cripples the opponent's bulk. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. Despite the name "Flare," it is not a fire-type move or a "pulse" move, though it functions as an explosive shock wave.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution, restricted exclusively to a single Mythical species (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized exclusively by **Shaymin (Land Forme)** and **Shaymin (Sky Forme)**. 
* **Competitive Synergy:** In its Sky Forme, Shaymin possesses the ability **Serene Grace**, which doubles the probability of secondary effects. This increases Seed Flare’s Sp. Def drop chance to a staggering **80%**, making it nearly impossible for defensive walls to switch into Shaymin-Sky without losing their Special bulk immediately.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its signature status, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. It defines Shaymin's offensive presence, allowing it to "muscle through" resistances like Steel or Fire by forcing stat drops.
* **Acquisition:** Signature Move. It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned by Shaymin via leveling up.
