## Identity & Mechanics
**Heat Wave** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user exhales a massive, searing blast of superheated air that engulfs the opposing side of the battlefield. This thermal wave carries enough intensity to melt steel and ignite foliage, characterized by its wide area of effect and potential to leave targets with lingering burns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent opponents. In Double Battles, the damage is reduced to 75% of its base power when hitting multiple targets.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to Burn the target(s).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Spread Attacker / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Heat Wave is the **gold standard for Fire-type offense in VGC (Doubles)** due to its ability to hit both opponents simultaneously. In Singles, it is often a secondary choice compared to *Flamethrower* (for 100% accuracy) or *Fire Blast* (for raw wallbreaking power), but it remains a vital coverage tool for Pokémon that lack better Fire-type options. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Does not make contact. Not a pulse or bomb move. It is particularly valued in **Sun Teams** where its power is boosted by 50%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (183 learners), making it one of the most accessible Fire-type coverage moves for non-Fire types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Charizard**, **Heatran**, **Volcarona**, and **Chi-Yu**, all of whom utilize it as their primary spread STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move in multi-battle formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Essential for Flying-types like **Zapdos**, **Togekiss**, and **Moltres** to provide critical coverage against Steel-type checks. It is also a common coverage pick for Dragon-types like **Hydreigon** and **Salamence**.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a Move Tutor move in older generations and as a **TM/TR** in more recent titles (Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet).
