## Identity & Mechanics
**V-create** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** As the signature move of the Victory Pokémon, Victini, the user manifests a colossal V-shaped aura of searing, white-hot flames upon its forehead before hurling its entire body at the opponent with immense kinetic force. This move represents the pinnacle of Fire-type physical offense, generating temperatures capable of melting the toughest alloys, though the sheer exertion of the attack leaves the user’s defensive shell and momentum momentarily compromised.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. Immediately following the attack, the user's Defense, Special Defense, and Speed stats are lowered by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the self-inflicted stat penalties.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 180, Accuracy 95%, PP 5.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.** V-create is one of the most powerful non-restricted moves in the game, rivaling the base power of ultimate moves like Explosion but without the drawback of fainting.
* **Usage:** It is primarily used to OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) even resistant foes when boosted by STAB and items like **Choice Band**. While its power is unrivaled, the guaranteed **Speed drop** makes the user highly susceptible to being "revenge killed" on the following turn. It is often compared to **Flare Blitz**, providing significantly higher damage at the cost of tactical positioning rather than recoil health. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Steel, Grass, and Ice** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner in standard play, plus limited event distributions).
* **Prominent Users:** Almost exclusively utilized by **Victini**, for whom it serves as its defining offensive tool. Under the effects of Victini's *Victory Star* ability, the 95% accuracy is boosted to nearly 100%.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically, a special event **Rayquaza** was distributed with V-create, allowing the Dragon/Flying legendary to bypass typical Steel-type checks like Ferrothorn or Skarmory with ease.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is a signature move tied to specific Mythical/Legendary Pokémon through leveling or special events.
