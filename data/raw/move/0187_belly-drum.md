## Identity & Mechanics
**Belly Drum** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user rhythmically beats its own stomach, sacrificing its physical vitality to push its adrenaline and muscle power to their absolute limits. This primal display of strength results in the user’s Attack stat being maximized instantly at the cost of half its maximum HP.
* **Effect:** The user pays exactly 50% of its maximum HP to raise its Attack stat to +6 stages (the maximum possible, effectively quadrupling its physical damage). If the user has less than 50% HP remaining, the move fails.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The HP reduction is a mandatory cost, not a secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Sweeper Setup / All-or-Nothing Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Belly Drum is the ultimate "high-risk, high-reward" move. Unlike Swords Dance or Dragon Dance, which require multiple turns to maximize power, Belly Drum reaches the damage cap in a single turn. It is almost exclusively paired with a **Sitrus Berry** to immediately restore 25% HP, or the **Gluttony** ability to trigger a Berry earlier. It is a staple in **Tera Raids** for massive burst damage. It provides physical pressure that can overwhelm even the bulkiest **Rock, Steel,** and **Ghost** types through sheer brute force, despite Normal-type moves having poor offensive matchups against them.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses Protect/Detect as it targets the user; fails if the user's Attack is already at +6.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (44 learners), often restricted to "round" or bulky Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Azumarill** (deadly when combined with the *Huge Power* ability), **Snorlax** (a classic user often utilizing *Gluttony*), and **Iron Hands** (the premier Belly Drum user in Generation IX Tera Raids).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Charizard** and **Linoone**; the latter uses it to enable a "BellyLinoone" sweep strategy involving Extreme Speed to bypass speed tiers.
* **Acquisition:** Historically rare, often appearing as an **Egg Move** or a high-level level-up move. It is generally not available as a standard TM/TR in most generations, making it a specialized tool for specific team builds.
