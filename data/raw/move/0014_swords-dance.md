## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —, Accuracy —%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Premier Offensive Setup / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Swords Dance is the gold standard for physical sweepers. By doubling its Attack in a single turn, a Pokémon can transform from a standard threat into a "nuke" capable of OHKOing (One-Hit Knock Out) defensive walls. It is often compared to **Dragon Dance**; while Dragon Dance provides a smaller Attack boost (+1) alongside Speed, Swords Dance is preferred by Pokémon that are already fast or those that rely on priority moves (like Bullet Punch or Extreme Speed) to bypass their Speed tier. It effectively counters Intimidate users by overriding the stat drop.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the user.
