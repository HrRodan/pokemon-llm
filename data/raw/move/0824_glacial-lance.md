## Identity & Mechanics
**Glacial Lance** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user manifests a colossal spear of solid ice, shrouded in a swirling, howling blizzard, and hurls it with immense force at the opposition. It is the signature move of **Calyrex (Ice Rider)**, representing the fusion of the King Pokémon’s psychic power and Glastrier’s frigid brute force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-magnitude Physical damage. In Double Battles, this move targets **all adjacent opponents** without damaging the user's ally, making it an elite spread move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. It relies on raw power rather than status-inflicting chances.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Signature High-Power Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Glacial Lance is arguably the most powerful Physical Ice-type move in the game. Unlike *Icicle Crash*, it does not miss, and unlike *Freeze-Dry*, it possesses massive base power. In the VGC (Doubles) format, it is a terrifying offensive tool because it lacks the "spread damage reduction" typically found in moves like Earthquake or Rock Slide, allowing Calyrex-Ice to pressure both opponents simultaneously. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** a contact move, meaning the user does not trigger effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is a specialized signature move (1 learner total).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Calyrex-Ice** (Ice Rider form). The move is gained automatically when Calyrex is fused with Glastrier using the Reins of Unity.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its exclusive nature, it is not used for coverage by other species. However, on Calyrex-Ice, it serves as the primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option, often boosted further by the **As One (Chilling Neigh)** ability, which raises Attack after every knockout.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is tied strictly to the fusion mechanics of the Crown Tundra Legendaries.
