## Identity & Mechanics
**Mega Kick** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses its entire muscular strength into a single, devastating blow, launching an incredibly powerful kick at the target. This high-impact maneuver represents one of the most forceful physical strikes a Pokémon can execute, trading precision for pure, bone-shattering momentum.
* **Effect:** Inflicts raw physical damage to a single target with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 75%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Mega Kick serves as a high-reward, high-variance option for Physical attackers. In competitive play, it is generally outclassed by **Double-Edge** (which offers the same power but higher accuracy at the cost of recoil) or **Return/Frustration** (which offers reliability). However, it remains a niche choice for Pokémon lacking better high-base-power STAB options or those participating in specific "No Recoil" formats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, as it is a Normal-type move, but provides neutral coverage against most types except Rock, Steel, and Ghost.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (236 learners), historically being one of the original TMs in the Kanto region.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Hitmonlee**, **Snorlax**, and **Lopunny**, who can utilize their high Attack stats to threaten massive damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on a variety of non-Normal Pokémon such as **Mewtwo**, **Charizard**, and **Lucario**. In early generations, it was a common "power" filler move for Pokémon with diverse movepools.
* **Acquisition:** It was a signature TM (TM05) in Generation I and saw a resurgence as a technical machine in Generation VIII (TM01) via Pokémon Sword and Shield.
