## Identity & Mechanics
**All-Out Pummeling (Physical)** is a Physical Fighting-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user harnesses the peak of its Z-Power to manifest a massive, glowing energy orb. It then charges forward with immense kinetic energy, ramming the orb into the target with absolute, unrestrained force. This move represents the ultimate physical expression of martial prowess, focusing all of the user's fighting spirit into a single, devastating strike.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that can only be used if the trainer possesses a **Fightinium Z** and the Pokémon knows a physical Fighting-type move. It converts the base move into a high-powered attack that **bypasses accuracy checks** and deals damage through protection (though damage is reduced to 25% if the target uses *Protect*).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the base Power is determined by the Power of the original move used to trigger it.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Physical Nuke.**
* **Usage:** In the Generation VII metagame, this move served as a one-time "delete button" to bypass traditional defensive checks. It is often used to secure a OHKO on a bulky Pokémon that would otherwise survive a standard Fighting-type attack like *Close Combat* or *High Jump Kick*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **Contact-based**, meaning it triggers abilities like *Iron Barbs* or *Rough Skin* and items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn any physical Fighting-type move (hundreds of potential users).
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-Attack threats such as **Buzzwole**, **Hawlucha**, and **Pheromosa** to maximize their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) output. **Kartana** often utilized this move (via *Sacred Sword*) to break through its usual Steel-type checks.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Garchomp** or **Landorus-Therian** (using *Superpower* or *Brick Break* as a base) to surprise and dismantle **Steel-type** walls like Skarmory or Ferrothorn.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII games (Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, Ultra Moon) by equipping a Pokémon with the **Fightinium Z** crystal.
