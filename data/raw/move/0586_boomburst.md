## Identity & Mechanics
**Boomburst** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user releases a catastrophic, high-frequency sonic shockwave that detonates with explosive force, vibrating the very air to damage everyone in the vicinity. As a sound-based move, it bypasses the protection of a **Substitute**, striking the target directly behind the barrier.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive raw damage to all adjacent Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (Spread move; hits allies in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / High-Power Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Boomburst is one of the most powerful moves in the game with no innate drawback (unlike *Draco Meteor*’s stat drops or *Hyper Beam*’s recharge turn). While Normal-type moves cannot deal **Super Effective** damage, Boomburst’s 140 Base Power allows it to muscle through neutral resists and even some defensive walls. It is the definitive upgrade to *Hyper Voice*.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based.** This makes it interact with specific abilities: it is amplified by **Punk Rock**, converted to Water-type by **Liquid Voice**, and completely negated by the **Soundproof** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (17 total learners), typically reserved for Pokémon with themes related to sound, vibration, or loud vocalizations.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Exploud:** The most iconic user; its **Scrappy** ability allows it to hit Ghost-types with Boomburst, removing the move's only immunity.
    * **Toxtricity:** Utilizes the **Punk Rock** ability to boost Boomburst's power by an additional 30%, making it a terrifying STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) threat.
    * **Noivern:** Leverages its high Speed tier to fire off powerful Boombursts as a late-game cleaner.
* **Coverage Utility:** 
    * **Flygon / Kommo-o:** Occasionally run on specialized Special Attacker sets to provide a high-power neutral hit against physical walls.
    * **Scream Tail:** Uses it as a rare offensive tool on otherwise defensive utility sets.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via Level Up or Egg Move; it is notably **not available as a TM or TR** in most generations, keeping its distribution highly exclusive.
