## Identity & Mechanics
**Cut** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user slashes the target with sharp claws, scythes, or blades to inflict damage. In the overworld, this move is historically significant as **HM01**, used to clear small trees and tall grass blocking the player's path. Its animation typically depicts a swift horizontal or cross-shaped slicing motion.
* **Effect:** Inflicts basic physical damage with no additional combat effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 95%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game Filler / HM Utility.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Cut is almost never utilized as it is strictly outclassed by other Normal-type moves like **Return**, **Body Slam**, or even **Slash** (which has a higher critical-hit ratio and higher base power). Its low base power and lack of secondary effects make it non-viable for high-level play. It deals **neutral damage** to most types but is completely **ineffective against Ghost types** and resisted by **Rock and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Effect Spore, and is boosted by the **Tough Claws** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (292 learners), as it was a mandatory field-progression tool in many early regions.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic "slashing" Pokémon such as **Scyther/Scizor**, **Kartana**, **Sceptile**, and **Charizard**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it provides neutral coverage, it is rarely seen on non-Normal Pokémon for competitive purposes. It is most frequently found on "HM Slaves" like **Bibarel** or **Linoone** in casual playthroughs to consolidate utility moves.
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught via **HM01** in nearly every generation until the removal of HMs in Gen VII; it returned as a **TM** in *Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl*.
