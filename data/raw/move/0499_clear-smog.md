## Identity & Mechanics
**Clear Smog** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user hurls a concentrated clump of neutralizing, chemical-rich mud or a thick cloud of specialized smog at the target. This unique substance reacts with the target's energy, instantly dissolving any supernatural stat enhancements or debilitating reductions. Unlike standard smog, this "clear" variant acts as a purifying agent that resets the battlefield state of the opponent.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and resets all of the target's stat modifiers (Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Accuracy, and Evasion) to zero.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reset stat stages upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy --% (Bypasses accuracy/evasion checks), PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Setup / Check.
* **Usage:** Clear Smog serves as a "Haze-on-a-stick," allowing a Pokémon to deal chip damage while simultaneously neutralizing a "Sweeper." It is the premier tool for stopping "Setup Sweepers" who use moves like Calm Mind, Dragon Dance, or Quiver Dance. Unlike the move *Haze*, Clear Smog is an attacking move, meaning it is blocked by **Steel-types** (due to Poison immunity) and does not bypass **Substitute**. However, its perfect accuracy makes it a hard counter to "Evasion-cheese" strategies.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types. 
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses accuracy checks (can only miss during semi-invulnerable turns like Fly or Dig).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (39 learners), primarily found among Poison-types or Pokémon associated with smoke, heat, and volcanic activity.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Amoonguss**, which uses it to shut down setup attackers in VGC and Smogon formats. It is also frequently utilized by **Weezing (and Galarian Weezing)** and the Ultra Beast **Nihilego**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Fire-types like **Torkoal**, **Armarouge**, and **Ceruledge** to provide utility against physical attackers that might otherwise use them as setup fodder.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up or as an Egg Move; it has historically not been a common TM/TR, making its presence on a team highly predictable but difficult to play around.
