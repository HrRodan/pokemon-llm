## Identity & Mechanics
**Shed Tail** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user strategically detaches its own tail to create a decoy, sacrificing a massive portion of its vitality to ensure a safe transition for a teammate. This move functions as a high-stakes combination of **Substitute** and **Baton Pass**, providing a "shielded pivot" that grants the incoming Pokémon a fresh Substitute to hide behind.
* **Effect:** The user consumes exactly **50% of its maximum HP** to create a Substitute. Immediately after the Substitute is formed, the user switches out of battle, allowing the player to select a replacement Pokémon from the party. The Substitute is then transferred to the incoming Pokémon. The move fails if the user has 50% or less HP remaining.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self-targeting pivot).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Premium Pivot / Setup Enabler.** 
* **Usage:** Shed Tail is considered one of the most powerful utility moves ever introduced, leading to its eventual ban in several competitive Smogon formats (like OU). It provides unparalleled **Momentum**, allowing a fragile "Glass Cannon" or a "Setup Sweeper" to enter the field protected by a Substitute, often guaranteeing a free turn to use moves like Dragon Dance or Quiver Dance. It is significantly more impactful than *U-turn* or *Volt Switch* because it transfers a defensive layer.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and is not affected by type resistances; however, it is blocked by the move **Taunt**.
* **Attributes:** High HP cost; requires the user to have a high HP pool or reliable recovery to use multiple times.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Very Narrow** distribution, being the signature mechanic for only **3 learners**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Cyclizar:** The premier user of this move. Thanks to its **Regenerator** ability, Cyclizar can heal back 33% of its HP upon switching out, effectively mitigating the 50% cost of Shed Tail and allowing it to spam the move throughout a match.
    * **Orthworm:** A defensive tank that uses its **Earth Eater** ability to find safe opportunities to Shed Tail, providing bulky setup support for its team.
    * **Sceptile:** Gained access to the move via the *Indigo Disk* DLC, utilizing its high speed to create a Substitute before the opponent can move.
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is not used for coverage but rather as the focal point of **Hyper Offense (HO)** team archetypes to facilitate safe entries for "win-condition" sweepers.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely rare; it is not available via TM or TR and is limited to a very select group of Pokémon by level-up or evolution.
