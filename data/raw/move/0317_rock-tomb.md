## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Tomb** is a physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user hurls massive boulders at the target, pinning them under the weight of the debris. This "tomb" of stone restricts the opponent's mobility, making it a premier tool for speed manipulation and tactical trapping.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to lower the target's Speed stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Speed.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 95%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** While its raw power is lower than **Rock Slide** or **Stone Edge**, Rock Tomb is prized for its guaranteed Speed drop. It is frequently used on "Lead" Pokémon to slow down faster threats or on "Technician" ability users (like Breloom) who boost its power to a formidable 90 while retaining the utility. It is often a safer mid-ground move than Stone Edge due to its higher accuracy.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution (478 learners), making it one of the most accessible coverage moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) users like **Tyranitar**, **Garganacl**, and **Aggron**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon such as **Garchomp**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Breloom**. Garchomp and Landorus-T often use it on utility or "Focus Sash" lead sets to ensure they can outspeed the opponent on the following turn. **Breloom** is a standout user, as its *Technician* ability transforms Rock Tomb into a high-accuracy, high-power nuke with built-in speed control.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (TM39 in many generations) or **TR**, appearing in almost every regional dex since its debut in Hoenn.
