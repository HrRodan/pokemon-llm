## Identity & Mechanics
**Final Gambit** is a Special Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user unleashes its entire life force in a desperate, explosive surge of energy directed at the opponent. By sacrificing its remaining vitality, the user strikes with a power that directly correlates to its current physical state before collapsing in exhaustion.
* **Effect:** Inflicts fixed damage equal to the user's current HP at the moment the move is executed. Immediately after dealing damage, the user faints. This damage ignores the user's Special Attack stat and the target's Special Defense stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Self-fainting is a mandatory cost, not a secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** Kamikaze Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Final Gambit is the ultimate high-stakes utility move designed to force a "1-for-1" trade. It is typically used by Pokémon with exceptionally high base HP or high Speed. By equipping a **Choice Scarf**, users attempt to move first while at full health to instantly delete a problematic defensive wall or a key offensive threat. Unlike *Explosion*, it provides guaranteed fixed damage that cannot be mitigated by Defense stats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types, though its damage remains fixed regardless of type effectiveness; however, **Ghost-types** are immune to the move, causing it to fail and the user to faint for zero damage.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses most damage-reduction abilities like Multiscale if the HP total is high enough.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (30 learners), primarily found among aggressive Fighting-types or Pokémon known for high-speed reckless behavior.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Annihilape** (which boasts a massive HP stat), **Staraptor** (a classic Choice Scarf lead), and the Mythical Pokémon **Victini**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Accelgor** and **Basculin** to act as a "fast faint" pivot, allowing a teammate to enter the field safely after removing a specific enemy threat. 
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through leveling up; it is not widely available as a TM or TR in most generations, making its presence on a team highly predictable but difficult to stop without a Ghost-type switch-in.
