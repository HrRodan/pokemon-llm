## Identity & Mechanics
**Zap Cannon** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user gathers an immense concentration of high-voltage electricity and discharges it as a massive, singular blast. While the move is notoriously difficult to aim, a successful hit delivers catastrophic damage and overloads the target's nervous system with electrical energy.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a guaranteed 100% chance to paralyze the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **Paralyze** (if the move connects).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Adjacent).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 50%, PP 5.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Speed Control**.
* **Usage:** Zap Cannon is the epitome of "high-risk, high-reward." While it boasts the same Power as *Hydro Pump* or *Fire Blast*, its abysmal accuracy makes it a "coin-flip" move. It is almost never used as a primary damage source unless paired with **Lock-On** or **Mind Reader** to guarantee a hit. Its primary competitive niche is forced **Speed Control**; a successful hit can permanently cripple an opposing sweeper. It is often compared to **Thunder**, which is more accurate in Rain, or **Thunderbolt**, which is the preferred "Reliable STAB" option. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypassed by **Volt Absorb**, **Lightning Rod**, and **Motor Drive**. It is completely negated by **Ground-types**, making them the safest switch-ins.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (104 learners), as it was a prominent TM in Generation II and has remained a staple in many Special attackers' movepools.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Magnezone**, **Zapdos**, **Regieleki**, and **Vikavolt**, who can leverage their high Special Attack to deal massive damage. **Porygon-Z** and **Blissey** also historically utilize the move in specific gimmicky sets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon like **Mewtwo**, **Genesect**, and **Gengar** as a high-stakes utility option to surprise and paralyze faster threats or Flying-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM07** in the Johto region (Gold/Silver/Crystal). While its availability as a TM/TR has fluctuated in later generations, it remains accessible via move tutors or level-up for most mechanical or electrical Pokémon.
