## Identity & Mechanics
**Hydro Vortex (Physical)** is a Physical Water-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Upon activating the Waterium Z crystal, the user channels its Z-Power to summon a massive, swirling oceanic maelstrom. This titanic whirling current traps the target at its center, crushing them with immense hydrothermal pressure and full-force kinetic energy.
* **Effect:** This is a specialized Z-Move that upgrades a base Physical Water-type move into a high-powered cinematic attack. Its base power is determined by the move it originates from (e.g., a 160-power nuke when converted from Waterfall). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, as a Z-Move, it bypasses the effects of moves like Protect or Detect, dealing 25% of its total damage through the shield. It also ignores accuracy and evasion checks.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** Physical Wallbreaker / One-time Nuke.
* **Usage:** Hydro Vortex is primarily used in the Generation VII competitive meta to "punch a hole" through dedicated physical walls. Unlike standard Water moves that might be stalled out, this Z-Move provides a guaranteed hit with massive damage potential to secure a K.O. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; power scales based on the underlying move (typically Waterfall, Liquidation, or Aqua Tail).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution, as any Pokémon capable of learning a Physical Water-type move in Generation VII can utilize this move while holding **Waterium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Gyarados:** Often paired with Dragon Dance, using Hydro Vortex to crush through bulky Pokémon that would otherwise survive a standard Waterfall.
    * **Azumarill:** Combined with the *Huge Power* ability, this move becomes one of the hardest-hitting physical attacks in the game.
    * **Araquanid:** Uses its *Water Bubble* ability to effectively double the power of Hydro Vortex, creating a specialized "nuke" build.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Dragon-types** like **Garchomp** or **Dragonite** in specific draft formats to surprise Ground-immune Fire types or provide specialized coverage against defensive Landorus-T.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible only in Generation VII via the **Waterium Z** crystal, typically obtained after completing the trial of Lana at Brooklet Hill.
