## Identity & Mechanics
**Memento** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user sacrifices its remaining life force to place a debilitating curse on the opponent. By fainting instantly, the user releases a surge of negative energy that harshly suppresses the target's offensive capabilities, leaving them demoralized and significantly weakened.
* **Effect:** The user faints immediately. In exchange, the target's **Attack** and **Special Attack** stats are both lowered by **two stages (-2)**. This effect fails if the target is behind a Substitute or has the Clear Body/White Smoke abilities.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The stat drop is the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Momentum Pivot** / **Setup Enabler**.
* **Usage:** Memento is a high-utility "suicide" move used to provide a "safe" switch-in for a teammate. By halving the opponent's offensive power (0.5x), the incoming Pokémon can safely use setup moves like **Dragon Dance**, **Quiver Dance**, or **Shell Smash**. It is frequently compared to *Healing Wish* or *Lunar Dance*; while those moves restore a teammate, Memento focuses on neutralizing the opponent to create "setup fodder."
* **Context:** It is a cornerstone of **Hyper Offense (HO)** teams. It effectively forces the opponent to switch out to reset their stats, granting the Memento-user's trainer a free turn of momentum.
* **Attributes:** Dark-type status move (bypassed by Dark-types with the *Prankster* ability in later generations). It does not check for accuracy checks but can be blocked by *Protect* or *Taunt*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (62 learners), primarily found among Ghost, Dark, and Poison types, as well as certain "mystical" or "sacrifice-themed" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Whimsicott:** The most iconic user due to the **Prankster** ability, allowing it to use Memento with +1 priority to neuter a threat before it can move.
    * **Latios:** Often uses Memento on offensive sets once its health is low to bring in a sweeper safely.
    * **Flutter Mane & Gholdengo:** High-tier competitive threats that utilize the move to maintain momentum in fast-paced formats like VGC or Smogon OU.
    * **Uxie:** A classic "Leads" Pokémon that sets *Stealth Rock* and then uses Memento to exit the field.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a coverage move, it is frequently seen on **Glimmora** or **Galarian Weezing** to disrupt the opponent's rhythm after they have fulfilled their primary roles (setting hazards or neutralizing abilities).
* **Acquisition:** Historically available as an Egg Move for many species, though it has appeared as a **TM/TR** in various generations (e.g., TR59 in Gen 8), making it accessible to a wide variety of utility-focused Pokémon.
