## Identity & Mechanics
**Stone Edge** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user summons or manifests jagged, razor-sharp stone pillars to impale the target from below or strikes them directly with sharpened rock shards. This move is characterized by its immense piercing power and focused lethality, designed to bypass defenses through sheer force and precision.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. It possesses an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage), making it more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages and screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Effect chance: N/A).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 80%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Stone Edge is the premier high-horsepower Rock-type move for physical attackers. While its 80% accuracy often leads to "unfortunate misses" in clutch moments (earning it the community nickname "Stone Miss"), its high base power and critical-hit chance make it indispensable for securing KOs that *Rock Slide* cannot. It is frequently paired with Ground-type moves (the famous "EdgeQuake" coverage) because very few Pokémon resist both types. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** High critical-hit ratio; does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (308 learners), making it one of the most accessible high-power physical moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a staple STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) move for heavy hitters like **Tyranitar**, **Terrakion**, **Garganacl**, and **Kleavor**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its ability to delete Flying-types, it is frequently used as a coverage option by non-Rock Pokémon such as **Garchomp**, **Machamp**, and **Landorus-Therian** to counter threats like Corviknight, Dragonite, or Volcarona.
* **Acquisition:** Stone Edge is widely available as a **TM or TR** (Technical Machine/Record) in every generation since its debut, ensuring almost any physical attacker with a rugged or rocky theme can learn it.
