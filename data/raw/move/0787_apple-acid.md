## Identity & Mechanics
**Apple Acid** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar Region).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a corrosive, tart liquid secreted from specialized apple-like skin, drenching the opponent in a specialized acidic spray. This move combines organic botanical power with chemical erosion, specifically designed to dissolve the target's natural resistances to special attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to lower the target's Special Defense stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Special Defense.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Progressive Wallbreaker / Utility STAB.
* **Usage:** While its base power is slightly lower than *Energy Ball* (90 BP), its 100% secondary effect makes it far superior for sustained combat. It acts as a "ramping" move; even if the opponent switches in a defensive wall, the guaranteed Sp. Def drop punishes the switch-in and makes subsequent hits increasingly lethal. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. Because it lowers stats, it is particularly effective against "Calm Mind" or "Assault Vest" users, effectively neutralizing their defensive boosts.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, functioning as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, this move is exclusive to **Appletun**, the evolution of Applin when exposed to a Tart Apple. It serves as Appletun's primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) tool, synergizing perfectly with its bulky, special-attacking stat spread.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extreme exclusivity, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. It defines Appletun's niche as a specialized tank that can force opponents to switch out to reset their lowered Special Defense.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally by Appletun upon evolution or through leveling.
