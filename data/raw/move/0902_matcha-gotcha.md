## Identity & Mechanics
**Matcha Gotcha** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The user, typically a spectral tea-master, whisks and fires a blast of piping-hot, aromatic matcha tea at the target. This specialized culinary attack bridges the gap between offensive pressure and sustainability, utilizing the life-force of the tea to mend the user's wounds while potentially scalding the opponent.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and restores the user's HP by **50% of the damage dealt**. In double battles, this move targets **all adjacent opponents**, making it a rare and powerful spread-recovery move.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **20% chance** to leave the target with a **Burn**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Targets all adjacent foes in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB / Recovery Pivot**.
* **Usage:** Matcha Gotcha is often considered a strictly superior version of *Giga Drain* for its primary user. While it has a slight accuracy check (90%), the trade-off is higher base power and the coveted ability to inflict **Burn**, a trait usually reserved for Fire and Water-type moves (like *Scald*). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Spread Move** in VGC/Double battles, allowing for massive HP recovery if both opponents are hit. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, acting as a signature move for its specific evolutionary line (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Sinistcha**. The move is central to Sinistcha's identity as a "bulky attacker," allowing it to stay on the field by draining health from bulky Water or Ground types like **Dondozo** or **Great Tusk**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not used for coverage by non-Grass types; however, for Sinistcha, it serves as a primary tool to check physical attackers by threatening a Burn.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally upon evolution or via leveling up by Sinistcha.
