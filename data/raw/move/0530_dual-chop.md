## Identity & Mechanics
**Dual Chop** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user delivers two rapid, brutal strikes against the target using its limbs or claws. This move is characterized by its high-intensity physical output, channeling draconic energy into a martial arts-style flurry of blows. It is particularly effective for disrupting defensive setups that rely on singular hits.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move hits exactly twice in one turn. Each hit has a separate calculation for critical hits and independent checks for abilities like Weakness Policy or Stamina.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (No status effect chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40 (Total 80), Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Multi-Strike STAB / Utility Shield-Breaker.
* **Usage:** Dual Chop is primarily used as a tactical alternative to **Dragon Claw**. While it shares the same total base power (80), Dual Chop's multi-hit mechanic allows it to **break Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and bypass Substitutes**, potentially KOing a fragile threat through its protection. However, the 90% accuracy introduces a risk of missing entirely, making it less reliable than Dragon Claw in high-stakes scenarios. It also triggers "on-contact" abilities like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet twice, which can be detrimental to the user. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is not boosted by Iron Fist (despite the "Chop" name) but interacts with multi-hit modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderately wide distribution (74 learners), predominantly appearing among Pokémon with draconic traits or martial arts themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by **Garchomp**, **Haxorus**, and **Kommo-o** as a niche STAB option to punish Substitute users or Lead Pokémon holding Focus Sashes. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon Pokémon such as **Machamp**, **Sceptile**, and **Infernape** to provide valuable Dragon-type coverage against opposing Dragon-types who resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up by Dragon and Fighting types; it was also featured heavily as a **Move Tutor** move in various games (such as B2W2 and USUM) rather than a standard TM.
