## Identity & Mechanics
**Lick** is a physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lashes out at the target with a long, spectral tongue to inflict damage. This contact-based attack carries a ghostly chill that can seize the target's nervous system, leaving them unable to move. It is a signature thematic move for Pokémon characterized by long tongues or gluttonous natures.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a significant chance to induce the Paralysis status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Paralyze** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Low-Power Utility / Early-game STAB.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Lick is generally considered a "Niche Utility" move or an early-game placeholder. Due to its very low base power, it is almost entirely outclassed by **Shadow Claw** for physical damage or **Shadow Ball** for special attackers. However, its 30% paralysis rate makes it a "fishing" move in low-tier formats, similar to Body Slam but with much lower damage output. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (50 learners), primarily concentrated among Pokémon with prominent tongues or those with a "spectral" or "gluttonous" theme.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Lickitung** and **Lickilicky** (thematic signature), the **Gengar** line (classic Gen I STAB), and **Snorlax**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Greninja**, **Incineroar**, and **Skeledirge** during early leveling stages, though it is rarely kept in final competitive movesets.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned via leveling up; it is rarely available as a TM or TR in modern generations, making its distribution static and tied to specific evolutionary lines.
