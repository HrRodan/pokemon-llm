## Identity & Mechanics
**Psywave** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user emits a series of fluctuating psychic energy waves that vary in intensity. This mental assault bypasses standard defensive calculations, manifesting as a shimmering distortion in the air that strikes the target with unpredictable force. Because the damage scales with the user's experience rather than raw power, it is often used by Pokémon with lower offensive stats to maintain a consistent threat level.
* **Effect:** Inflicts "fixed" damage that ignores the user’s Special Attack and the target’s Special Defense. The damage dealt is calculated as a random multiplier (ranging from 0.5× to 1.5×) of the user’s current level.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. 
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Fixed-Damage Utility / Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** Psywave is the Psychic-type equivalent to *Night Shade* or *Seismic Toss*, but with a high-variance gambling element. While *Seismic Toss* provides a guaranteed 100 damage at level 100, Psywave can high-roll for 150 damage or low-roll for 50. In competitive play, it is generally considered inferior to its counterparts due to this inconsistency. However, it allows Psychic types to deal significant damage to high-Special Defense walls like **Blissey** or **Goodra**. 
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Typeless Damage**, meaning it ignores type resistances (e.g., Steel or Psychic). However, from Generation II onwards, it cannot hit **Dark-type** Pokémon due to their innate immunity to Psychic-type moves.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by King’s Rock (in most generations) or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (60 learners), primarily found among Kanto-region Pokémon and various mystical or extraterrestrial entities.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with **Mewtwo**, **Alakazam**, and **Mew**. It is also a thematic fit for spectral or cosmic Pokémon like **Mismagius**, **Lunatone**, and **Solrock**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon with high utility but lower offensive pressure, such as **Misdreavus** or **Bronzong**, to ensure they can contribute chip damage regardless of the opponent's defensive investment.
* **Acquisition:** Psywave was famously available as **TM46** in the original Red, Blue, and Yellow versions, but it has become much rarer as a technical machine in later generations, primarily being learned through level-up.
