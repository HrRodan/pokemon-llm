## Identity & Mechanics
**Torment** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user psychologically provokes the target, inducing a state of mental distress that prevents the target from performing the same action twice in a row. This move is designed to disrupt muscle memory and tactical repetition, forcing the opponent to cycle through their move pool or succumb to exhaustion.
* **Effect:** Prevents the target from attempting to use the same move twice in succession. This effect is removed when the target switches out. If the target is locked into a single move (via Choice items, Encore, or having only one move with PP), they are forced to use **Struggle** every other turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Disruption / Stall Utility / Anti-Choice Tech.
* **Usage:** Torment is a niche but devastating tactical tool used primarily to break the rhythm of offensive sweepers and "Choice" item users. It is the cornerstone of the infamous **"Torment-Protect"** strategy, where a bulky Pokémon alternates between Torment and Protect, making it impossible for an opponent to hit them with the same move twice, often forcing a switch or a weak coverage move. It acts as a soft check to Pokémon that rely on "spamming" high-power moves like *Close Combat* or *Draco Meteor*.
* **Attributes:** Bypassed by **Magic Bounce** and **Magic Coat**. It does not check for accuracy and will hit through most evasive modifiers but can be blocked by *Substitute*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (227 learners), making it a common utility option for Dark-types and mischievous Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Heatran** to create "TormentTran" sets. Other high-level users include **Sableye** (who can abuse it with *Prankster* priority), **Gliscor**, and **Grimmsnarl**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on versatile Legendaries like **Mew**, **Darkrai**, and **Tyranitar** to shut down specific counters that rely on a single move to break their defenses. 
* **Acquisition:** Historically very easy to obtain, serving as **TM41** in every generation from its debut in Hoenn through the Alola region.
