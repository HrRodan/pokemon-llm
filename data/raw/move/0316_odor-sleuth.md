## Identity & Mechanics
**Odor Sleuth** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user sharpens its sense of smell to track the target's movements, sniffing out their exact location. This heightened awareness allows the user to pinpoint foes attempting to hide behind illusions or those that are naturally intangible. It is a specialized tracking move designed to neutralize evasive maneuvers and spiritual phasing.
* **Effect:** Resets the target’s evasion stat to normal and prevents any further evasion-boosting modifications while the target remains on the field. Additionally, it identifies Ghost-type targets, allowing them to be hit by Normal-type and Fighting-type moves for neutral damage. This move itself ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers to ensure it always connects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [—]%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Gimmick.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in niche formats or casual play to counter "Evasion Cheese" (like Double Team or Minimize). In competitive play, its role is largely outclassed by the Ability **Scrappy**, which allows the user to hit Ghost-types without wasting a turn on setup. It acts as a manual "lock-on" for STAB Normal-type nukes or Fighting-type coverage against Ghost-type switch-ins.
* **Context:** Functionally identical to the move **Foresight**. It is a reliable way for physical attackers to bypass the immunity of Ghost-types, though it requires a "turn of setup" which often kills momentum.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses Protect/Detect if the move's specific mechanics are triggered (though the status effect itself can be blocked by standard protection).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), primarily concentrated among Pokémon with keen senses or animalistic designs.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Arcanine**, **Stoutland**, and **Lycanroc** (all forms).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy hitters like **Mamoswine** or **Emboar** in specific playthrough contexts to ensure their powerful Physical STAB moves can connect with Ghost-type threats like Gengar or Mismagius.
* **Acquisition:** While not a TM/TR move in most generations, it is a common level-up move for "tracker" themed Pokémon and can occasionally be passed down as an Egg Move.
