## Identity & Mechanics
**Attack Order** is a physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user, acting as a hive commander, signals a swarm of underlings to descend upon the target in a coordinated strike. This "strength in numbers" approach allows for tactical strikes on vital points, represented by an increased likelihood of critical hits. It is a signature move that visualizes the hierarchical nature of certain insectoid colonies.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move has an increased critical hit ratio (1 stage higher than normal, effectively a 12.5% base crit rate).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Critical hit ratio is a built-in mechanic, not a percentage-based secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Attack Order is considered the gold standard for physical Bug-type moves, offering a higher base power than **X-Scissor** (80) without the accuracy drawbacks of **Megahorn** (85% accuracy). Its high critical hit ratio allows the user to occasionally bypass defensive stat boosts (Reflect, Iron Defense). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite the visual of underlings "pummeling" the target, this move is notably **not a contact move** in most generations, meaning the user does not trigger effects like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (Only 1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the signature move of **Vespiquen**. It is part of a thematic trio of "Order" moves (alongside *Defend Order* and *Heal Order*) that define Vespiquen's utility as a hive queen.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is never seen as coverage on non-Bug types. In competitive formats like "Sketchmons" or "Monotype," it is highly valued for its perfect accuracy and high base power compared to other Bug-type options.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR. It is learned exclusively through leveling up by Vespiquen.
