## Identity & Mechanics
**Draco Meteor** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user summons a localized celestial storm, calling down a barrage of glowing comets from the sky to strike the target with overwhelming draconic energy. This meteoric impact is so taxing on the user's mental and spiritual focus that it causes a significant "recoil" effect on their offensive capabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage, but immediately lowers the user’s Special Attack stat by two stages (-2 SpA) after use.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the Special Attack drop.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Special Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Draco Meteor is the definitive "Hit-and-Run" move for Special-based Dragon types. Because of the sharp Special Attack drop, it is often used by **Pivots** who intend to strike once and immediately switch out to reset their stats. It is frequently paired with a **Choice Specs** for maximum immediate damage or an **Eject Pack** to automate the switching process. While **Dragon Pulse** is the "Consistency Option," Draco Meteor is preferred for its ability to secure One-Hit Knockouts (OHKOs) on neutral targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses most defensive abilities like Fluffy or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution among Dragon-types (103 total learners), historically serving as the "ultimate move" taught by specialized Move Tutors.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Special attackers like **Latios**, **Hydreigon**, **Dragapult**, and **Dialga** utilize this as their primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on versatile Pokémon like **Mew** or **Silvally-Dragon** to provide high-base-power coverage against opposing Dragon-type threats. 
* **Acquisition:** While traditionally a Move Tutor exclusive, it has been made available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (specifically TM169 in Scarlet & Violet), making it more accessible than in early Sinnoh or Unova appearances.
