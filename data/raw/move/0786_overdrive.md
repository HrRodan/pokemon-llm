## Identity & Mechanics
**Overdrive** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user channels its internal electricity through a musical performance, twanging its chest-protrusions like a guitar or bass. This creates a massive sonic echo and violent electrical vibrations that ripple through the battlefield. As a **sound-based move**, it resonates through physical barriers, allowing it to bypass the move **Substitute**.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent special damage to all adjacent opponents. Unlike many spread moves, it does not hit the user's ally in Double Battles.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for status), but it interacts uniquely with sound-based abilities and items like the Throat Spray.
* **Targeting:** All-opponents (Spread).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Spread Attacker / Substitute Bypass.
* **Usage:** While its base power is slightly lower than *Thunderbolt* (90), Overdrive is the superior choice for its primary users due to the **Punk Rock** ability, which boosts the power of sound-based moves by 30%, effectively giving Overdrive a base power of **104** before STAB. It is a staple in VGC and Doubles formats for its ability to hit both enemies without friendly fire. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (Bypasses Substitute; blocked by the Soundproof ability; triggers Throat Spray).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is currently the **signature move** of the Toxtricity line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Toxtricity (Amped Form)** and **Toxtricity (Low-Key Form)**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its hyper-specific distribution, it is not used as coverage on other Pokémon. However, for Toxtricity, it serves as the primary Electric-type offense, often paired with *Boomburst* to take full advantage of sound-based damage multipliers.
* **Acquisition:** This is a signature level-up move; it is not available via **TM/TR** or Move Tutor for other Pokémon.
