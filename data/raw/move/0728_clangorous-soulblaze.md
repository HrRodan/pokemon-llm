## Identity & Mechanics
**Clangorous Soulblaze** is a Special Dragon-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** Channeled through the Kommonium Z crystal, the user, Kommo-o, vibrates its armored scales with rhythmic, overwhelming intensity to release a massive sonic shockwave. This cacophonous blast of energy resonates across the entire battlefield, devastating opponents while simultaneously invigorating the user’s physical and mental capabilities. As a sound-based move, it bypasses the effects of **Substitute**.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage to all adjacent opponents. If the move successfully deals damage to at least one target, the user receives an "Omniboost," increasing its **Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed** by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the stat-boosting effect upon successful contact.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 185, Accuracy —% (Cannot miss), PP 1.
* **Role:** Game-Ending Setup Nuke / Sweeper Catalyst.
* **Usage:** This is arguably the most powerful Z-Move in competitive history due to its "Omniboost" mechanic. In Gen 7 Battles (USUM), it transformed Kommo-o from a niche pick into a top-tier threat. It is used to simultaneously eliminate a weakened target and set up for a sweep. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute, blocked by Soundproof). It is a **Z-Move** requiring the base move Clanging Scales and the held item Kommonium Z.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Z-Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kommo-o**. It requires Kommo-o to know the move **Clanging Scales** and hold its unique Z-Crystal.
* **Coverage Utility:** While the move itself isn't used for coverage, Kommo-o's ability to trigger an Omniboost makes its coverage moves (like *Close Combat*, *Poison Jab*, or *Flash Cannon*) significantly more threatening to Fairy and Steel-type counters.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is only accessible in Generation VII games by obtaining the **Kommonium Z** in the Vast Poni Canyon. In later generations, this move is inaccessible as the Z-Move mechanic was removed.
