## Identity & Mechanics
**Snap Trap** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user manifests or utilizes a physical, jagged restraint—resembling a bear trap—to violently ensnare the target. By snapping shut on the opponent, the move ensures they cannot escape the battlefield while inflicting consistent, crushing residual damage. This move is designed for lockdown strategies and tactical attrition.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and prevents the target from switching out or fleeing for 4 to 5 turns. During this period, the trapped Pokémon loses 1/8th (standard for modern trapping moves, though older data cites 1/16th) of its maximum HP at the end of every turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to induce the **Trapped** status condition. The effect ends immediately if the user switches out or if the target uses Rapid Spin or Mortal Spin to break free.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Trapping Utility / Disruptor.**
* **Usage:** Snap Trap is primarily used as a tactical tool rather than a source of raw damage. It functions similarly to moves like *Fire Spin*, *Whirlpool*, or *Infestation*, but utilizes the Physical category. It allows the user to pin a passive wall or a vulnerable threat on the field, enabling the user to either chip them down with residual damage or switch into a counter after the trap is set (if holding an Eject Button or using a pivoting move). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**. It is a signature move, granting it unique niche value in specific formats.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (1 learner), making it a Signature Move.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Galarian Stunfisk**. The move's flavor perfectly matches Galarian Stunfisk's design as a "Trap Pokémon" hidden in the ground like a bear trap. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its exclusive distribution, it is not seen as coverage on other Pokémon. On Galarian Stunfisk, it is often paired with *Stealth Rock* or *Yawn* to capitalize on the opponent's inability to switch.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it can only be learned by Galarian Stunfisk through leveling up.
