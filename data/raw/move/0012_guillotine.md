## Identity & Mechanics
**Guillotine** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user employs sharp pincers, massive blades, or powerful scythes to deliver a lethal "pincer attack" designed to end a battle in a single strike. Visually, it represents a brutal execution-style move where the opponent is caught in a vice-like grip and crushed or sliced. This move is the quintessential "all-or-nothing" gamble in the Pokémon repertoire.
* **Effect:** This is a **One-Hit Knockout (OHKO)** move. If it connects, it deals damage equal to the target’s maximum HP, instantly causing them to faint. It ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers (such as Double Team or Sand Attack). Crucially, the move's success is level-dependent: it will always fail if the user is a lower level than the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Guaranteed faint upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 30%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Finisher / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** In standard competitive play (Smogon), Guillotine is frequently banned under the **OHKO Clause** due to its ability to bypass defensive checks regardless of stats. In formats where it is permitted (like Battle Stadium or VGC), it is used as a desperate "hail mary" to remove Unaware walls or incredibly bulky stall Pokémon that the user cannot otherwise damage. It is completely ineffective against **Ghost-types** due to their immunity to Normal-type moves.
* **Type Matchups:** Deals neutral damage to all types except **Steel** and **Rock** (which it still OHKOs if it hits), and **Ghost** (which is immune).
* **Attributes:** Considered a contact move; triggers abilities like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, primarily restricted to Pokémon with prominent blades, pincers, or scythes (19 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Kingambit**, **Pinsir** (and Mega Pinsir), **Gliscor**, and **Kingler**. These Pokémon often have the natural bulk to survive long enough to attempt the move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on high-attack threats like **Kartana** and **Haxorus**. While these Pokémon usually prefer high-accuracy STAB moves, Guillotine serves as a niche option to break through "unbreakable" defensive cores.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned via level-up by crustacean or blade-themed Pokémon; it has rarely been available as a TM/TR in recent generations, making its distribution highly exclusive to its natural learners.
