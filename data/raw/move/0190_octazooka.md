## Identity & Mechanics
**Octazooka** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user fires a massive, high-pressure burst of black ink from its mouth or siphon, behaving like a biological cannon. This ink cloud obscures the battlefield and clings to the opponent, drastically hindering their vision and precision.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a significant chance to obscure the target's vision.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s Accuracy by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 85%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Disruption / Utility Special Attack.
* **Usage:** Octazooka is primarily a "niche disruption" move. While its raw power (65) and shaky accuracy (85%) make it technically inferior to reliable STAB options like **Surf** or **Scald**, its 50% secondary effect chance is one of the highest accuracy-dropping rates in the game. This forces opponents into a "coin flip" scenario where they may miss their next move, potentially forcing a switch. However, in high-level competitive play, it is generally considered too unreliable compared to the burn-inflicting utility of Scald. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range projectile; notably interacts with **Lock-On** in early-generation contest mechanics to ensure a hit.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (4 total learners), functioning almost as a signature move for cephalopod-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** The move is the signature identity of **Octillery** and its pre-evolution **Remoraid**. It is also learned by **Grapploct**, despite it being a pure Fighting-type.
* **Coverage Utility:** While **Horsea** (and eventually **Kingdra**) can learn it, they almost exclusively prefer the higher damage output of Hydro Pump or the consistency of Surf. **Grapploct** is the most unique user, utilizing the move for thematic flavor and niche accuracy-lowering tech, though it lacks STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) on the move.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is not available as a TM or TR, requiring specific level-up or breeding paths within its very small pool of learners.
