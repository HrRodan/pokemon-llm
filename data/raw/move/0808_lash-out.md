## Identity & Mechanics
**Lash Out** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user releases a burst of malice and pent-up resentment to strike the opponent. This retaliatory energy manifests as a violent physical blow that feeds on the user's own frustration, growing significantly more powerful if the user's focus or capabilities have been hindered during the heat of battle.
* **Effect:** Deals standard damage. However, if the user’s stats were lowered by an opponent's move or ability (such as Intimidate) during the same turn, the base power of the move is doubled from 75 to 150.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75 (Potential 150), Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Anti-Meta Tech / Conditional Nuke.
* **Usage:** Lash Out is primarily a counter-measure against the ubiquitous **Intimidate** ability and speed-control moves like **Icy Wind** or **Bulldoze**. While its base power is slightly lower than *Crunch*, its potential to become a 150-power Dark-type nuke (higher than *Hyper Beam*) makes it a terrifying deterrent in VGC (Double Battles). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (161 learners), making it a common sight on physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Incineroar**, **Kingambit**, and **Tyranitar**. It is particularly synergistic with Kingambit, who already punishes stat drops via the *Defiant* ability.
* **Coverage Utility:** Seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Gyarados**, **Annihilape**, and **Salamence** to punish opponents attempting to lower their Attack stats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a Move Tutor move in the Sword/Shield expansion (*Isle of Armor*) and as a TM in *Scarlet & Violet*.
