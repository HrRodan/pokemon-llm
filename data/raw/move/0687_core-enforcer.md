## Identity & Mechanics
**Core Enforcer** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a devastating beam of concentrated energy from its core, often carving a glowing "Z" into the battlefield. This move represents the corrective power of the ecosystem's guardian, designed to suppress and punish the target's innate traits. Its visual execution and thematic weight make it a hallmark of Dragon-type legendary power.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage. If the target has already moved or performed an action during the same turn, its Ability is suppressed (nullified) as long as it remains in battle.
* **Secondary Effect:** Ability Nullification (Conditional: Target must have moved first).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double/Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Disruptive Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Core Enforcer serves as a powerful, high-accuracy alternative to **Draco Meteor** or **Dragon Pulse**. While it lacks the raw nuke potential of Draco Meteor, it avoids the Special Attack drop, making it more sustainable for bulky sets. Its ability suppression is a potent tool against defensive threats relying on abilities like **Unaware**, **Multiscale**, or **Regenerator**, though it requires the user to be slower than the target or for the target to have acted. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a beam-based spread move; it does not make contact and is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof** in certain generations.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (5 learners), functioning as a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Zygarde** in its various forms, including **Zygarde-10%**, **Zygarde-50%**, and the massive **Zygarde-Complete Forme**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. However, on Zygarde, it provides a crucial Special-flavored Dragon STAB to complement its Physical Ground-type signatures like *Thousand Arrows*.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is typically learned via Move Reminder or upon reaching a specific level (Level 1 in Gen VII/VIII for Zygarde).
