## Identity & Mechanics
**Flail** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user strikes out wildly and desperately, channeling its remaining energy into a frantic assault. The move’s power increases as the user’s HP decreases, representing a last-stand struggle. In a retrieval context, this move is synonymous with "low-HP scaling," "desperation attacks," and "last-resort mechanics."
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the user's current HP percentage. The lower the user's health, the higher the base power. The scale ranges from a meager **20 Power** (at >67% HP) to a devastating **200 Power** (at <2.1% HP).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 20–200], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Desperation Sweeper.**
* **Usage:** Flail is the cornerstone of the "Endure + Flail" (EndureFlail) strategy. Trainers often use a **Focus Sash** or the move **Endure** to survive an incoming hit with exactly 1 HP, maximizing Flail's base power to 200. This makes it one of the strongest unboosted moves in the game, though it is highly susceptible to **Priority moves** (like Extreme Speed), **Entry Hazards** (Stealth Rock), and **Passive Damage** (Sandstorm or Burn). It deals **neutral damage** to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet, which can be fatal for a user at 1 HP.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **wide** distribution (164 learners), appearing frequently across various biological groups.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Magikarp:** Historically iconic as Magikarp's only way to deal significant damage.
    * **Snorlax:** Utilizes its massive HP pool and high Attack to occasionally run "Flail" sets.
    * **Heracross & Gyarados:** Powerful physical attackers that can reach 200 Power easily with their natural bulk or setup moves.
    * **Dondozo:** A modern bulky user that can utilize the move in niche "last-stand" scenarios.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Dodrio** and **Linoone** who utilize their high Speed to attempt a sweep once brought down to their Focus Sash. It is also found on Water-types like **Feraligatr** and **Basculin** as a high-damage neutral option when HP is depleted.
* **Acquisition:** While primarily learned through leveling up or as an Egg Move, it has appeared as a **TM/TR** in specific generations (like TR20 in Gen 8).
