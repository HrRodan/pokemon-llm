## Identity & Mechanics
**Clangorous Soul** is a Status Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user vibrates its metallic scales with intense rhythm, generating a deafening, resonant sound that pushes its physical and mental capabilities to their absolute limits. This ritualistic display of power grants a massive surge in all combat attributes but exerts a heavy toll on the user's physical stamina.
* **Effect:** The user raises its Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats by one stage each (an "Omniboost"). In exchange, the user sacrifices exactly 33% (1/3) of its maximum HP. The move fails if the user has less than 33% HP remaining.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to increase all stats (primary effect).
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Setup Sweeper / Omnibooster.**
* **Usage:** Clangorous Soul is a high-stakes setup move that functions as a non-Z-Move successor to Kommo-o's "Clangorous Soulblaze." It is used to transform a bulky attacker into a lethal late-game win condition. Unlike *Shell Smash*, which lowers defenses, Clangorous Soul increases bulk, making the user harder to revenge-kill despite the HP loss. It pairs exceptionally well with the item **Throat Spray**, which triggers on sound-based moves to grant an additional +1 Special Attack boost, resulting in a +2 Special Attack total in a single turn.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move; it is blocked by the ability *Soundproof* but can be amplified by sound-related mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Kommo-o**. It defines Kommo-o's identity in the Galar region and subsequent appearances, allowing it to function as a versatile Mixed Sweeper.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a self-buffing Status move, it does not provide coverage, but the omniboost makes Kommo-o’s STAB *Clanging Scales* and *Close Combat* significantly more threatening against a wide array of targets.
* **Acquisition:** Learned naturally via leveling up; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other Pokémon.
