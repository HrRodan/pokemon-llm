## Identity & Mechanics
**Needle Arm** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user lashes out at the target with limbs covered in sharp, jagged thorns or needles. This physical strike utilizes the user’s prickly physiology to pierce the opponent’s defenses, often leaving them startled by the sudden, painful impact. It is a flavor-rich move primarily associated with cactus-like or armored Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**, preventing them from moving if the user attacks first.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Low-Power Utility / Flinch-Abuse STAB.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low, Needle Arm functions as a "hax" tool due to its high 30% flinch rate, similar to moves like *Bite* or *Headbutt*. In modern competitive play, it is generally outclassed by more powerful options like **Seed Bomb** (80 BP) or **Leaf Blade** (90 BP). However, in lower tiers or during a main-story playthrough, its perfect accuracy and flinch potential make it a reliable choice. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, restricted to a small group of Pokémon with specific "arm-like" physiology (5 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** It is most famously associated with **Cacturne** (its original signature user in Gen III) and **Maractus**. It is also utilized by the Kalos starter evolution **Chesnaught** and its pre-evolution **Quilladin**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as a coverage move on non-Grass types. It is almost exclusively used by Pokémon that receive **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) from it.
* **Acquisition:** Needle Arm is a rare move that is **not available via TM, TR, or HM**; it can only be learned through Leveling Up or as an Egg Move in specific generations.
