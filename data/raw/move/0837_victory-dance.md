## Identity & Mechanics
**Victory Dance** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII, specifically debuting in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*.
* **Description:** The user performs a rhythmic, ceremonial martial arts dance to channel the spirit of triumph. This focus sharpens the user’s combat instincts, visually manifesting as a surge of fighting energy that bolsters both their physical resilience and their striking power.
* **Effect:** In standard competitive play (Gen IX), this move raises the user's **Attack, Defense, and Speed** stats by one stage each. In its debut in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, it raised offensive and defensive stats while granting a "primed" status that increased damage dealt by 50%.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self-Buff).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Elite Setup Sweeper** / **Physical Quiver Dance**.
* **Usage:** Victory Dance is widely considered one of the best setup moves in the game. It is the physical counterpart to Quiver Dance, providing the "Holy Trinity" of stats for a physical sweeper: Power (Attack), Speed (to outpace threats), and Bulk (Defense to survive priority moves like Extreme Speed or Sucker Punch). While Fighting-type itself, the move enables the user to deal **Super Effective** damage against **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types with their STAB or coverage attacks.
* **Attributes:** This is a Dance-based move, meaning it can be copied by the Ability **Dancer** (Oricorio).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, serving as a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, this move is the signature move of **Hisuian Lilligant**. The move transforms Hisuian Lilligant from a glass cannon into a terrifying bulky sweeper, especially when paired with its *Hustle* or *Victory Star* abilities.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, its existence makes Hisuian Lilligant a premier choice for teams needing a Fighting-type setup threat that can bypass traditional checks like faster Choice Scarf users.
* **Acquisition:** Victory Dance is not available via TM or TR; it is learned exclusively by **Hisuian Lilligant** upon evolution or through the Move Reminder.
