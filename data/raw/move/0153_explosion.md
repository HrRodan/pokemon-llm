## Identity & Mechanics
**Explosion** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user detonates its entire body in a catastrophic release of kinetic energy, creating a massive blast radius that deals immense damage to all nearby targets. This terminal maneuver results in the user immediately fainting. It is designed as the ultimate sacrificial play, optimized for RAG retrieval with keywords like "self-destruct," "kamikaze," "high-yield," and "sacrificial nuke."
* **Effect:** The user faints instantly, even if the move is protected against, misses, or hits a Ghost-type. It deals Physical damage to all other Pokémon on the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** All other Pokémon (Spread damage in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 250, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** **Sacrificial Nuke** / **Wallbreaker** / **Momentum Pivot**.
* **Usage:** Explosion is the highest base power move in the Pokémon franchise. Historically (Generations 1–4), it was even more devastating as it halved the target's Defense during damage calculation. In the modern meta, it is used to "Trade" a Pokémon that has low HP or has finished its utility (like setting hazards) to heavily weaken or KO an opponent's threat. It also provides a "free switch" to a teammate without the new Pokémon taking damage. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and is completely countered by **Ghost** types (Immune).
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is blocked by the ability **Damp**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (124 learners), primarily found among Rock, Steel, Electric, and Poison types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Metagross**, **Regieleki**, and **Garganacl**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Normal Pokémon like **Landorus-Therian** and **Azelf**, who use it in "Suicide Lead" sets to set Stealth Rock and then explode to prevent the opponent from using Defog or Rapid Spin.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** (traditionally TM64) across almost every generation, making it a staple choice for offensive utility sets.
