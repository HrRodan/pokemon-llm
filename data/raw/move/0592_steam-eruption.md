## Identity & Mechanics
**Steam Eruption** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user blasts the target with an immense, pressurized explosion of superheated, hydrothermal steam. This move combines the raw destructive force of high-pressure water with the searing heat of a volcanic vent, capable of vaporizing surroundings and causing severe thermal trauma.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-velocity Special damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to Burn the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 95%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Legendary Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Steam Eruption is widely considered one of the best moves in the game. It effectively combines the high-power output of **Hydro Pump** with the debilitating secondary effect of **Scald**. In competitive play, it allows the user to pressure physical attackers by threatening a Burn while simultaneously dealing massive damage to neutral targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is non-contact and is not blocked by many common protection abilities like Bulletproof or Soundproof, though it is absorbed by **Water Absorb** and **Storm Drain**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner), as it is the **Signature Move** of the Mythical Pokémon Volcanion.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Volcanion**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Volcanion is a unique Fire/Water-type, Steam Eruption serves as its primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) tool, allowing it to threaten Water-type switch-ins with Burn chip damage or blow through Fire-types that would otherwise resist its secondary typing.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is strictly learned by Volcanion through leveling up. This rarity makes it a defining feature of Volcanion's presence in the Smogon OU or Uber tiers.
