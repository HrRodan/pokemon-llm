## Identity & Mechanics
**Hex** is a Special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a malicious, dark aura that preys upon the weakened state of the target. This relentless attack channels spiritual energy to deal massive damage specifically to targets already suffering from debilitating conditions. It is a tactical move that rewards players for utilizing status-inflicting strategies, making it a "finisher" in many competitive sets.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. However, if the target is afflicted with a major status condition (Burn, Paralysis, Poison/Badly Poisoned, Sleep, or Freeze), the move's base power doubles from 65 to 130.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The power doubling is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65 (130 if target has status), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Condition-Dependent Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Hex is the primary alternative to **Shadow Ball**. While Shadow Ball provides a consistent 80 BP, Hex offers a much higher ceiling (130 BP), making it stronger than even *Draco Meteor* or *Blue Flare* without the drawbacks, provided the target is statused. It is commonly paired with **Will-O-Wisp**, **Thunder Wave**, or **Toxic Spikes** support. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact, Special, bypasses most defensive layers except for Normal-type immunity.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (155 learners), appearing across various types beyond just Ghost-types.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Gengar:** The classic Hex user, often utilizing its high speed to inflict Will-O-Wisp before firing off a boosted Hex.
    * **Dragapult:** Frequently runs Hex in competitive play alongside Will-O-Wisp or Thunder Wave to break through physically defensive walls.
    * **Skeledirge:** Uses its natural bulk to spread Burn with Will-O-Wisp, then cleans up with STAB Hex.
    * **Flutter Mane:** Often utilizes Hex in formats where status (like Icy Wind or paralysis) is prevalent to maximize its already massive Special Attack.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Toxapex** or **Galarian Slowking** to punish poisoned targets or provide unexpected coverage against Psychic-type threats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet, making it easy to slot onto any compatible Special Attacker.
