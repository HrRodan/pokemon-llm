## Identity & Mechanics
**Dizzy Punch** is a physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user rhythmically pummels the target with a dizzying, unpredictable barrage of fists. The chaotic movement and impact are designed to leave the opponent dazed and disoriented, creating an opening for further assault.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to cause the **Confusion** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Tech Move. 
* **Usage:** In early generations, it served as a signature-style move for specific Pokémon. In modern competitive play, it is generally outclassed by moves like *Return* (higher power) or *Body Slam* (30% paralysis chance). However, it finds a niche on Pokémon with the **Iron Fist** ability, which boosts its power by 20% (to 84), making it a reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option with a disruption chance.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is **Resisted** by Rock and Steel and has **No Effect** on Ghost types. It cannot deal Super Effective damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, benefiting from the Iron Fist ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (15 total learners), often associated with Pokémon known for boxing or erratic movement.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with **Kangaskhan** (its signature move in Gen I) and **Spinda**, who utilizes it thematically. It is also a staple for **Hitmonchan** and **Lopunny**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Crabominable** or **Ledian** as a reliable filler move. Its presence on **Reuniclus** is notable, though rarely used over its superior Special Attack options.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through leveling up; it is not commonly available as a TM/TR in recent generations, making it a relatively rare move in modern Movepools.
