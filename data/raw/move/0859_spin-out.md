## Identity & Mechanics
**Spin-Out** is a physical Steel-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user generates immense torque by furiously straining its legs or engine-like anatomy, rotating at high speeds to slam into the target with metallic force. This extreme physical exertion causes high friction and mechanical strain, resulting in a **harsh reduction in the user's Speed stat**. It is characterized by high-intensity rotation and physical impact.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and lowers the user's Speed stat by two stages (-2).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's Speed.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Power Physical STAB** / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Spin-Out is a high-risk, high-reward move similar in drawback to *Overheat* or *Draco Meteor*, but affecting Speed rather than offensive stats. It allows the user to deliver a heavy hit immediately, but the -2 Speed drop often forces the user to switch out afterward (resetting the drop) or function as a slow tank. It is particularly effective in **Trick Room** teams, where lowering one's own speed actually allows the Pokémon to "speed up" under the dimensions' warped logic.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types. 
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (2 total learners), serving as the signature move for the Varoom evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, it is exclusively utilized by **Revavroom** and its pre-evolution **Varoom**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because of its exclusive nature, it is not currently found as a coverage option on other Pokémon. On Revavroom, it serves as a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option for dealing with Fairy-type threats like Flutter Mane or Clefable.
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM/TR**; it is learned naturally through leveling up, making it a rare and specialized tool within the Paldea region's competitive circuit.
