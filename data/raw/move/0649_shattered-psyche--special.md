## Identity & Mechanics
**Shattered Psyche (Special)** is a Special Psychic-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** The user focuses its Z-Power to create a colossal manifestation of mental energy, fracturing the target's psyche with overwhelming telepathic force. The move creates a visually stunning distortion in reality, where the user projects a concentrated beam or wave of purple psychic light that shatters the opponent's mental defenses.
* **Effect:** This is a damaging Z-Move that can only be used if the trainer possesses a **Psychium Z** and the Pokémon knows a base Special Psychic-type move. It deals massive damage based on the power of the original move. Like most Z-Moves, it bypasses accuracy checks and penetrates protection (dealing 25% damage through Protect).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Z-Move variant).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats (SM/USM) to secure OHKOs on bulky threats that might otherwise survive a standard Psychic or Psyshock. It is particularly devastating when used under **Psychic Terrain**, which provides an additional 1.5x damage multiplier (in Gen VII). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; ignores evasion/accuracy modifiers; base power is determined by the move it upgrades (e.g., Psychic becomes 175 BP, Psycho Boost becomes 200 BP).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (available to any Pokémon capable of learning a Special Psychic-type move in Gen VII).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Tapu Lele:** The premier user, combining Psychic Surge (Terrain) with a 175 BP Shattered Psyche to delete almost anything that doesn't resist it.
    * **Mewtwo / Mew:** Iconic Psychic-types that utilize this to break through specially defensive walls like Chansey (if using Psyshock as a base) or Toxapex.
    * **Alakazam:** Often uses this in its non-Mega form to provide a one-time massive burst of speed and power.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Nihilego** or **Latios** to lure in and eliminate specific checks like Mega Venusaur or Toxapex.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Psychium Z** Crystal, obtained in the Alola region (Generation VII) at the Thrifty Megamart (Abandoned Site) after completing Acerola’s trial.
