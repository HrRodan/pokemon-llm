## Identity & Mechanics
**Will-O-Wisp** is a status Fire-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user manifests a sinister, flickering blue-orange flame that dances toward the opponent to inflict a debilitating burn. Unlike standard fire attacks that rely on raw heat, this move utilizes supernatural or concentrated thermal energy to ensure the target is set ablaze, making it a staple for both ghostly entities and masters of fire.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Burn** status condition on the target. This deals chip damage every turn and, most importantly, reduces the target's **Attack stat by 50%**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The burn is the primary effect). It does not affect Fire-type Pokémon or those with the Water Veil or Flash Fire abilities.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 85%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Physical Crippler.
* **Usage:** Will-O-Wisp is one of the most influential status moves in the competitive meta. Its primary function is to **Check** and neutralize physical Wallbreakers and Sweepers by halving their damage output. It is often compared to *Scald* (which has a lower burn chance but deals damage) and *Thunder Wave* (which provides speed control). Because it is a status move, it bypasses defensive stat boosts. It is particularly effective for **Stall** and **Balance** teams looking to increase their longevity.
* **Attributes:** Hits through *Substitute* in some earlier generations (though generally blocked by it in modern mechanics). Does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (175 learners), spanning mostly Ghost, Fire, and Psychic types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Rotom (all forms)**, **Gengar**, **Dragapult**, and **Skeledirge**. These Pokémon use it to shore up their defenses or punish switches.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon like **Mew**, **Gardevoir**, and **Sableye** to provide essential utility and prevent them from being overwhelmed by physical attackers. It is a vital tool for **Arceus-Ghost** and **Giratina** in higher tiers.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (TM61 in many generations) or **TR**, making it accessible to a vast array of Pokémon across almost every regional Pokédex.
