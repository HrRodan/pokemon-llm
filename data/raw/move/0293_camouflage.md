## Identity & Mechanics
**Camouflage** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user masterfully alters its cellular structure or coloration to blend into the surrounding environment, shifting its elemental type to match the current battlefield terrain. Whether hiding in tall grass, submerged in water, or standing on rugged mountains, the Pokémon becomes one with its habitat to gain tactical advantages.
* **Effect:** Changes the user's current type based on the battle environment. In modern competitive settings (Gen VI onwards), the move interacts directly with active Battle Terrains:
    * **Electric Terrain:** Becomes Electric-type.
    * **Grassy Terrain:** Becomes Grass-type.
    * **Misty Terrain:** Becomes Fairy-type.
    * **Psychic Terrain:** Becomes Psychic-type.
    * **Default (No Terrain):** Usually becomes Normal-type in Link Battles.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Gimmick.
* **Usage:** Camouflage is a niche "Type-Shifter" move. Compared to more reliable moves like *Reflect Type* or *Conversion*, Camouflage is highly dependent on the environment or the presence of "Terrain-setters" (like Tapu Koko or Rillaboom). Its primary competitive use is to shed a disadvantaged typing to gain resistances or a new STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) profile mid-battle. It deals **No Damage** directly and therefore does not hit for Super Effective damage, but it dictates how the user will deal and receive damage for the remainder of the switch-in.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; affected by Snatch.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (22 learners), primarily found among Pokémon themed around mimicry, aquatic adaptation, or environmental resonance.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Starmie**, which uses it to navigate its diverse flavor-lore habitats; **Kecleon**, the quintessential master of blending in; and the Legendary Pokémon **Zygarde**, which can utilize it to shift its Ground/Dragon typing.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Dragalge** or **Stunfisk** to pivot away from their natural weaknesses (like Dragon or Ground) when specific Terrains are active.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM or TR. It is almost exclusively learned through natural leveling or as an Egg Move, making its presence in a moveset often unexpected.
