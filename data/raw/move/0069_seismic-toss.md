## Identity & Mechanics
**Seismic Toss** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user seizes the target and utilizes a massive, looping throw—often depicted as tossing the opponent around the curvature of the earth—to inflict damage. Because the force is derived from the user's momentum rather than raw strength, it deals damage exactly equal to the user's current level (e.g., 100 HP damage at Level 100). 
* **Effect:** Inflicts fixed damage equal to the user's level. This damage ignores the target's Defense stats, Reflect, and type resistances. However, as a Fighting-type move, it cannot hit Ghost-type Pokémon (unless affected by Foresight or Scrappy).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Fixed], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Fixed Damage Utility / Consistent Chip.**
* **Usage:** Seismic Toss is a staple on **Defensive Walls** and **Stall** archetypes. Since it does not rely on the user's Attack stat, it allows Pokémon with pathetic offensive presence to deal guaranteed, consistent damage. It is the primary tool for punishing "Set-up Sweepers" who rely on Defense boosts, as it bypasses stat changes entirely. Its main rival is **Night Shade**, which functions identically but is Ghost-type, hitting Fighting-types while being resisted by Normal-types.
* **Type Matchups:** Deals neutral fixed damage to almost all types. It is **ineffective** against **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution with **157** potential learners, largely due to its status as a TM in Generation I and a common Move Tutor/Egg Move in later years.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Chansey** and **Blissey**, providing them with a way to deal damage despite their near-zero Attack stats. It is also a common choice for **Registeel** and **Mega Kangaskhan** (where Parental Bond allows it to hit twice for 200 damage).
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Annihilape** or **Throh** for flavor, but primarily used by defensive stalwarts like **Deoxys-Defense** or **Mew** to maintain pressure while focusing on utility sets.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available via **TM04** (Gen I), Move Tutors (Emerald/FRLG), and as a frequent **Egg Move** for humanoid or bulky Pokémon. It remains a fixture in the "Let's Go" series as TM15.
