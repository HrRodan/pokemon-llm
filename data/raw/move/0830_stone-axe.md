## Identity & Mechanics
**Stone Axe** is a physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user brandishes massive, jagged stone appendages to cleave the target with brutal force. The impact is so violent that it shatters the user's stony blades, scattering razor-sharp splinters across the battlefield. This move is optimized for critical hits and territorial control.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and simultaneously sets the **Stealth Rock** entry hazard on the opponent's side of the field. In its debut, it caused a "splintered" status, but in standard competitive play (Gen IX), it functions as a damaging way to deploy hazards.
* **Secondary Effect:** Increased **Critical Hit ratio** (+1 stage). 100% chance to set Stealth Rock upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Utility Hazard Setter** / **Slicing Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Stone Axe is considered one of the most "role-compressed" moves in the franchise. Its primary value lies in its ability to set Stealth Rock while dealing damage, making it **Taunt-proof** and bypassing the limitations of traditional status-based hazard setters. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types. 
* **Attributes:** This is a **Slicing Move**, meaning its base power is boosted by 50% (reaching ~97 BP) when used by a Pokémon with the **Sharpness** ability. It makes contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kleavor**, the Axe Pokémon. It serves as Kleavor's defining signature move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not used for coverage by other types. However, on Kleavor, it allows the Pokémon to function as a premier **Lead/Hazard Setter** that threatens Flying-type Defoggers like Corviknight or Zapdos with STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage while ensuring hazards remain on the field.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is a signature move learned via level-up or move tutoring specifically for the Scyther evolution line in the Hisui region.
