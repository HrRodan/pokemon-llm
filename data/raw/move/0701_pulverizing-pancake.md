## Identity & Mechanics
**Pulverizing Pancake** is a Physical Normal-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** Exclusive to Snorlax, this move is triggered by Z-Power channeled through a Snorlium Z crystal. The user, typically known for its lethargy, suddenly awakens and moves its enormous body with surprising speed and energy, leaping high into the air before slamming down on the target with its full, concentrated weight. This move is designed as a high-impact, cinematic finisher.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. As a Z-Move, it bypasses standard accuracy checks and cannot be fully protected against (dealing 25% chip damage through moves like Protect).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 210, Accuracy —, PP 1 (One-time use per battle).
* **Role:** **High-Power Nuke / Wallbreaker.** 
* **Usage:** Pulverizing Pancake is one of the strongest moves in the history of the franchise. It is used to secure an immediate KO on a defensive threat or a bulky neutral target that Snorlax otherwise couldn't break through. Unlike its base move, **Giga Impact**, Pulverizing Pancake does not require a "recharge" turn, providing Snorlax with a massive momentum swing. It deals neutral damage to most of the roster but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is a Signature Z-Move.
* **Prominent Users:** Only **Snorlax** can perform this move. It serves as the primary reason to run Snorlax in Alolan competitive formats (VGC 2017/2018).
* **Coverage Utility:** None; it is a specialized STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move. Because it requires Snorlax to hold the **Snorlium Z** and know the move **Giga Impact**, it forces a specific move slot and item choice, limiting Snorlax's ability to run items like Figy Berry or Leftovers.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Snorlium Z** Crystal. The move is inaccessible in later generations where the Z-Move mechanic was removed.
