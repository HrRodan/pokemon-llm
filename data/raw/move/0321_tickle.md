## Identity & Mechanics
**Tickle** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user approaches the target and tickles them into a fit of laughter, causing them to lose their competitive focus and physical posture. This playful distraction momentarily breaks the opponent's concentration, effectively lowering their guard and reducing their offensive output.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack and Defense stats by one stage each.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply stat drops upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Debuffer.
* **Usage:** While often overlooked for more specialized moves like *Will-O-Wisp* (which provides a permanent burn) or *Screech* (which drops Defense by two stages), Tickle is a unique "two-in-one" debuff. It is most effective in **Singles** to force a switch-out from a physical attacker who can no longer deal damage or take hits effectively. In **VGC/Doubles**, it can be used to soften a target for a partner's physical Max Move or high-power contact move.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Protect" if used via certain Z-Move mechanics (Gen 7), but otherwise follows standard status move checks. It is blocked by targets with the *Clear Body*, *White Smoke*, or *Full Metal Body* abilities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution with **76 total learners**, primarily consisting of "cute" Pokémon, aquatic species, and flexible utility supports.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on **Whimsicott** (who can abuse it with the *Prankster* ability for priority), **Clefable**, and **Dondozo**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally utilized by high-tier threats like **Tapu Lele**, **Nihilego**, and **Ludicolo** as a niche tech option to cripple physical switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** Tickle is rarely a TM/TR; it is most commonly learned through **Leveling Up** or as an **Egg Move** within the Fairy and Water 1/2 egg groups.
