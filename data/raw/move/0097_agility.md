## Identity & Mechanics
**Agility** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user relaxes its body and sharpens its mental focus to move at extreme speeds, often appearing as a blur or leaving behind afterimages. This burst of kinetic energy allows the user to bypass normal physiological limits of movement.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user’s Speed stat by two stages (+2), effectively doubling the user's current Speed.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** Speed Control / Setup Sweeper.
* **Usage:** Agility is a cornerstone for "Bulky Offense" teams. While it does not provide an offensive boost like *Dragon Dance* or *Shift Gear*, its +2 Speed modifier is superior for immediately outspacing the entire unboosted metagame, including common Choice Scarf users. It is frequently paired with a **Weakness Policy** or used by Pokémon with naturally high offensive stats that simply lack the Speed to sweep.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; not affected by Protect (as it targets the user).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (353 learners), making it one of the most accessible speed-boosting moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Dragonite**, **Metagross**, and **Zapdos**. In higher power tiers, **Mewtwo** and **Regieleki** can utilize it to reach untouchable Speed tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on heavy-hitting Special Attackers like **Empoleon** or **Lucario** to transform them from slow wallbreakers into terrifying late-game cleaners. It is also a vital tool for Paradox Pokémon like **Iron Bundle** or **Iron Moth** to ensure they maintain momentum.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common; it has been featured as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in almost every generation, including the most recent titles *Sword & Shield* and *Scarlet & Violet*.
