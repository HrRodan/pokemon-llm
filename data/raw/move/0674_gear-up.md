## Identity & Mechanics
**Gear Up** is a Status Steel-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user engages its internal clockwork and rotates its mechanical gears to synchronize with its teammates. This mechanical resonance emits an empowering frequency that bolsters the combat capabilities of the user and its allies, specifically those sharing a similar electromagnetic polarity.
* **Effect:** Raises the **Attack** and **Special Attack** stats of the user and all friendly Pokémon on the field by one stage each, provided they have the **Plus** or **Minus** Ability.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% success rate on valid targets).
* **Targeting:** User and Allies (optimized for Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Niche Team Support / Setup.**
* **Usage:** Gear Up is a highly specialized setup move designed almost exclusively for **Double Battles**. It functions as a multi-target "Work Up," providing a dual-offensive boost. However, its viability is strictly limited by its requirement for the **Plus** or **Minus** abilities, making it an "Ability-locked" utility move. In competitive VGC or Smogon doubles, it is rarely seen unless a team is specifically built around Plus/Minus synergy (e.g., Klinklang and Toxtricity pairings).
* **Attributes:** This is a **non-contact** move. As a Steel-type status move, it is unaffected by Type Matchup charts but is blocked by "Taunt."

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, limited to only **3** specific Pokémon families.
* **Prominent Users:** The move is the signature thematic choice for **Klinklang**, the Gear Pokémon, and the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna** (including its **Original Color** form).
* **Coverage Utility:** Unlike most Steel-type moves, Gear Up provides no offensive coverage; its value lies entirely in its ability to turn a defensive or supportive Pokémon into a dual-offensive threat alongside a specific partner. 
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM or TR; it is learned exclusively through level-up by its few natural practitioners. Often overlooked in favor of Magearna's more immediate offensive threats like *Shift Gear* or *Fleur Cannon*.
