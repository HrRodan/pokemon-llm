## Identity & Mechanics
**Eerie Impulse** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user’s body generates a strange, high-frequency electromagnetic pulse that radiates outward. By exposing the target to these jarring waves, the user disrupts the opponent's focus and energy output, which harshly lowers the target’s Special Attack stat.
* **Effect:** Harshly lowers the target's Special Attack stat by two stages (-2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply stat drop).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Utility / Anti-Sweeper Debuff.
* **Usage:** Eerie Impulse serves as the Special-oriented counterpart to the move Charm. It is a powerful tool for shutting down Special Wallbreakers and setup sweepers (like Calm Mind users). While it does not deal damage like *Snarl* or *Struggle Bug*, the -2 drop is immediate and significant, often forcing the opponent to switch out (forcing a "phaze"). As an Electric-type move, it is important to note that it **fails against Ground-type Pokémon**.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses "Protection" moves only if used by a Pokémon with the Infiltrator ability (standard interaction otherwise). It is particularly effective in VGC (Doubles) to neuter high-threat Special attackers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Electric-types and technologically themed Pokémon (86 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Zapdos**, **Rotom (all forms)**, **Bellibolt**, and **Porygon2**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon like **Claydol**, **Sandy Shocks**, and **Glow-in-the-dark/Mechanical** themed creatures to provide defensive utility against Special threats they might otherwise struggle to wall.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a common "filler" move for defensive pivots.
