## Identity & Mechanics
**Snowscape** is a Status Ice-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user calls upon a freezing front to blanket the battlefield in a thick, shimmering snowstorm for five turns. Unlike the previous weather condition "Hail," Snowscape focuses on atmospheric fortification, creating a winter landscape that chills the air and physically hardens the resilience of Ice-type combatants.
* **Effect:** Changes the weather to **Snow** for five turns (eight turns if the user holds an Icy Rock). While it is snowing, the **Defense** stat of all Ice-type Pokémon on the field is increased by 50%.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A. However, it overrides other weather conditions like Sun, Rain, or Sandstorm.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 0, Accuracy --%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Weather Setup / Defensive Support.
* **Usage:** Snowscape is the Generation IX successor to Hail. Its primary value lies in its **Defensive Buff**, making Ice-types (traditionally a fragile offensive typing) significantly harder to OHKO with physical moves. It is an essential tool for **Snow Teams**, enabling specific abilities like **Slush Rush** (doubles Speed) and **Ice Face**. It deals **Super Effective** damage indirectly by enabling 100% accuracy for the move **Blizzard**.
* **Attributes:** Field Move; Bypasses accuracy checks; Directly buffs Ice-type survivability against Physical attackers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (105 learners), as it serves as the universal manual weather setter for Ice types in modern generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Baxcalibur**, **Cetitan**, **Abomasnow**, and **Alolan Ninetales**. While many of these possess the "Snow Warning" ability to set snow automatically, Snowscape is used as a manual backup to win weather wars.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on bulky Water or Psychic types like **Slowbro**, **Articuno**, and **Lapras** to increase their physical bulk and disrupt opposing weather-reliant teams (such as Sun/Rain teams).
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM052** in Pokémon Scarlet and Violet.
