## Identity & Mechanics
**Venom Drench** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user exhales or sprays a specialized, murky poisonous liquid that drenches all opponents on the field. While the liquid itself is non-corrosive to healthy targets, it reacts violently with existing toxins in a poisoned subject's bloodstream, causing immediate lethargy and muscle weakness. This move is a powerful debuffing tool designed to cripple a foe's offensive presence and agility.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack, Special Attack, and Speed by one stage (1.5x reduction) simultaneously. This effect **only** triggers if the target is currently afflicted with the Poison or Badly Poisoned status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reduce stats (conditional on status).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (hits both foes in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Multi-Stat Debuff / Stall Support.
* **Usage:** Venom Drench is a niche but devastating "punishment" move. It is effectively a combination of Noble Roar and a Speed debuff in a single turn. Its main rival is **Parting Shot** or **Will-O-Wisp**; however, Venom Drench is unique because it hits both offensive stats and speed. It is most effective in "Toxic Stall" cores or on teams utilizing **Toxic Spikes**. It does not deal damage, but it effectively neutralizes a poisoned "Wallbreaker" or "Sweeper" by stripping away their power and turn-priority. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is biologically ineffective against **Steel** and **Poison** types unless the user has the **Corrosion** ability, as those types cannot normally be poisoned to meet the move's requirement.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses effects like King's Rock but is blocked by **Substitute** and **Magic Coat**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (57 learners), primarily concentrated among Poison-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by defensive stalwarts like **Toxapex** and **Weezing**, or fast status-spreaders like **Salazzle** and **Crobat**. The legendary **Eternatus** also features this in its movepool to cripple opponents in high-tier play.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon like **Seismitoad** and **Trevenant**, who use it to capitalize on teammates' status-spreading or their own access to Toxic. 
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM91** in Pokémon Sword and Shield, making it accessible to a variety of Pokémon with liquid-based or toxic flavor profiles.
