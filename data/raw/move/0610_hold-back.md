## Identity & Mechanics
**Hold-Back** is a physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user executes a restrained strike, intentionally limiting their power to ensure the opponent is not completely incapacitated. This move is designed for strategic mercy, characterized by a controlled physical blow that leaves the target clinging to consciousness with exactly 1 HP. It is the functional clone of the move *False Swipe*.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage. This move is incapable of fainting a Pokémon; if the damage would exceed the target's remaining health, the target is instead left with 1 HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance). 
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Utility / Catching Specialist. 
* **Usage:** In a competitive PvP (Player vs. Player) context, Hold-Back has **zero viability** due to its low base power and inability to secure KOs. However, it is a "S-Tier" utility move for **In-Game Completionists** and **Shiny Hunters**. It allows players to safely weaken wild Pokémon to the minimum possible HP to maximize capture rates without the risk of an accidental critical hit killing the target.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types. It cannot hit **Ghost** types unless the user has the Scrappy ability or uses moves like Foresight/Odor Sleuth.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Hold-Back has a very narrow and unique distribution, often serving as a special "Event Move" rather than a naturally learned technique.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily associated with event-exclusive Pokémon such as the **Launch Event Beldum (Metagross)** in Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire and the **Pokémon Bank Celebi** distribution.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on the **Johto and Unova Starters** (Meganium, Typhlosion, Feraligatr, Serperior, Emboar, Samurott) when distributed with their Hidden Abilities via special events.
* **Acquisition:** Unlike its counterpart False Swipe, Hold-Back is rarely available as a TM/TR. It is almost exclusively obtained through limited-time distributions or specific NPC tutors in certain generations, making it a rare "souvenir" move for collectors.
