## Identity & Mechanics
**Quick Attack** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lunges at the target at a speed that makes them a blur, ensuring they strike before the opponent can react. This move is a staple "speed-tier" bypass, designed to provide immediate momentum regardless of the user's base Speed stat.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage but is guaranteed to strike first within its priority bracket.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though its **+1 Priority** bracket is its defining characteristic.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Priority Finisher / Revenge Killer.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Quick Attack is used to "chip off" the remaining HP of a faster foe or to break a **Focus Sash** before the opponent can move. It is often compared to **Extreme Speed**, which has higher priority (+2) and double the power, but is much less widely distributed. It also serves as a safer alternative to **Sucker Punch**, as it does not fail if the opponent uses a status move.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is **Resisted** by Rock and Steel, and has **No Effect** on Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (206 learners), making it one of the most common priority moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously associated with **Pikachu**, **Scizor**, **Lucario**, and the various **Eeveelutions** (such as Espeon and Jolteon).
* **Technician Synergy:** It is a vital tool for Pokémon with the **Technician** ability, such as **Scizor** or **Ambipom**, which boosts the move's power from 40 to 60, making it a much more threatening revenge-killing tool.
* **Type Conversion Utility:** It is frequently seen on **Sylveon** or **Mega Pinsir**; their respective abilities (**Pixilate** and **Aerilate**) convert Quick Attack into a Fairy or Flying-type move and grant a power boost, allowing them to bypass their natural speed tiers with STAB priority.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up by a vast majority of bird-like, feline, and canine Pokémon across all eight regions.
