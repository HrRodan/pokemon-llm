## Identity & Mechanics
**Charm** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation II (originally a Normal-type move prior to Generation VI).
* **Description:** The user adopts an endearing pose and gazes at the target with heart-melting eyes. This sudden display of cuteness catches the opponent off guard, draining their competitive will and significantly reducing their physical strength.
* **Effect:** Sharply lowers the target's Attack stat by two stages (-2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Defensive Debuff.
* **Usage:** Charm is a potent tool for neutralizing physical sweepers and wallbreakers. While moves like *Growl* only lower Attack by one stage, Charm's double-stage drop effectively halves the opponent's Attack stat in a single turn, forcing switches. It is often compared to **Baby-Doll Eyes**, which has lower impact (-1) but possesses +1 Priority. Charm is preferred on bulkier supports that can afford to move second to permanently cripple a physical threat.
* **Attributes:** As a status move, it does not deal damage and therefore does not trigger STAB. It is blocked by the ability **Clear Body**, **Hyper Cutter**, or **Mirror Armor**, and is ineffective against targets behind a **Substitute**. Being a Fairy-type move in modern generations, it is also blocked by the ability **Good as Gold**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (263 total learners), primarily found among "cute" or Fairy-group Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by iconic Fairy types such as **Sylveon**, **Clefable**, and **Togekiss** to bolster their physical bulk. It is also a signature flavor move for **Pikachu** and the **Eeveelutions**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Whimsicott** and **Cottonee**, who can abuse the **Prankster** ability to give Charm +1 Priority, effectively neutering physical attackers before they can land a hit. It is also used by high-speed threats like **Flutter Mane** in VGC to mitigate damage from physical attackers like Urshifu.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has consistently appeared as a **TM** (TM02 in Sword/Shield, TM002 in Scarlet/Violet) and was frequently an Egg Move in earlier generations.
