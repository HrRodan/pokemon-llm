## Identity & Mechanics
**Rage Powder** is a status Bug-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user scatters a thick cloud of irritating, shimmering spores or powder that distracts and infuriates opponents. This cloud acts as a visual and sensory taunt, forcing all opposing Pokémon to focus their single-target aggression exclusively on the user, thereby shielding their teammate from harm.
* **Effect:** Until the end of the turn, any single-target moves used by opponents that would have targeted the user’s ally are redirected to the user. This effect takes priority over redirection abilities like **Lightning Rod** or **Storm Drain**. It is a **Powder-based move**, meaning Grass-type Pokémon, Pokémon with the **Overcoat** ability, or those holding **Safety Goggles** are immune to its redirection.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Priority +2).
* **Targeting:** User (Affects the targeting of all opponents).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Redirector / Support Utility.**
* **Usage:** Rage Powder is a staple of the **Doubles and VGC** formats, serving as a functional clone of *Follow Me*. Its primary purpose is to protect a "glass cannon" teammate or a "setup sweeper" (e.g., a Pokémon using Belly Drum or Trick Room). By drawing fire, the user acts as a sacrificial or bulky **Redirector**. However, its Bug-typing and Powder status make it slightly less reliable than Follow Me, as Grass-types can ignore the redirection entirely to snipe the user's ally.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it deals no damage. It is most effective when used by bulky Pokémon that can resist common priority moves or survive powerful hits.
* **Attributes:** Powder-based move; +2 Priority bracket; Bypassed by moves with the "Propeller Tail" or "Stalwart" abilities.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (20 learners), primarily limited to Bug-type and Mushroom-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Amoonguss**, which pairs the move with its *Regenerator* ability for incredible longevity, and **Volcarona**, which uses it in niche support sets or to protect a partner. **Sinistcha** and **Brute Bonnet** are modern competitive staples that use the move to enable Trick Room or Protosynthesis-boosted allies.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a "coverage" move in the offensive sense, it is seen on **Butterfree** and **Vivillon** to facilitate "Compound Eyes" Sleep Powder setups or to allow a partner to boost stats safely.
* **Acquisition:** Generally not available via TM or TR; it is primarily learned via level-up, making its presence highly predictable on specific Pokémon in the team preview.
