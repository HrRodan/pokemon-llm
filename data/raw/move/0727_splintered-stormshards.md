## Identity & Mechanics
**Splintered Stormshards** is a Physical Rock-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** After channeling immense Z-Power, the user, Lycanroc, manifests and hurls a massive cluster of jagged, crystalline stone shards at the target. The impact is so violent that the resulting shockwave shatters the very earth, instantly neutralizing any active elemental or magical terrain effects on the battlefield. This move is characterized by its high-velocity projectile animation and geological destruction.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage to a single target and automatically removes any active Terrain (Electric, Grassy, Misty, or Psychic Terrain).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to remove Terrain. Being a Z-Move, it bypasses accuracy checks to guaranteed a hit (unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 190, Accuracy --%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Utility Disruptor.
* **Usage:** This is the signature Z-Move for Lycanroc, requiring the **Lycanium Z** Crystal and the move **Stone Edge**. It is significantly more powerful than the generic Rock-type Z-Move, *Continental Crush* (which has 180 Power when used with Stone Edge). Its primary competitive niche is its ability to "nuke" a threat while simultaneously stripping away Terrain-based strategies, such as Tapu Lele’s Psychic Terrain or Tapu Koko’s Electric Terrain. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. As a Z-Move, it deals 25% chip damage even if the opponent uses *Protect* or *Detect*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, as it is a species-specific Z-Move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively used by **Lycanroc (Midday Form)**, **Lycanroc (Midnight Form)**, and **Lycanroc (Dusk Form)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While Lycanroc is a pure Rock-type, this move is essential for **Lycanroc-Dusk** in the Gen VII Ultra Sun/Moon meta to bypass defensive checks and remove terrains that might hinder its teammates (e.g., clearing Psychic Terrain so a teammate can use priority moves).
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Lycanium Z** crystal; it is not available in later generations due to the removal of the Z-Move mechanic.
