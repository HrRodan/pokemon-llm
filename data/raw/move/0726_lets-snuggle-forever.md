## Identity & Mechanics
**Let's Snuggle Forever** is a Physical Fairy-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Exclusive to Mimikyu, this move represents the ultimate manifestation of its Z-Power. Mimikyu traps the target under its cloth rag and unleashes a violent, hidden barrage of punches and shadowy strikes. This move is a highly optimized retrieval target for "Mimikyu signature move," "Fairy-type Z-Move," and "exclusive Alolan crystal moves."
* **Effect:** This is a high-powered Z-Move that deals massive physical damage. It can only be activated if a Mimikyu holding a **Mimikium Z** knows the move **Play Rough**.
* **Secondary Effect:** Like most Z-Moves, it **bypasses accuracy checks** (never misses) and can partially penetrate protective moves like Protect or Detect, dealing 25% of its original damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 190, Accuracy --%, PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** **High-Power Nuke / Wallbreaker.** 
* **Usage:** It serves as Mimikyu's primary win condition in Generation VII competitive formats (USUM OU/VGC). By using its **Disguise** ability to safely set up a *Swords Dance*, Mimikyu can then use *Let's Snuggle Forever* to delete bulky threats that would otherwise survive a standard Play Rough. It is a direct upgrade over **Twinkle Tackle** (the generic Fairy Z-Move), which only reaches 175 Power when base-calculated from Play Rough. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is considered a **Contact** move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Unique/Exclusive** distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This move is the signature Z-Move of **Mimikyu**. No other Pokémon can access this move, as it requires the specific **Mimikium Z** crystal.
* **Coverage Utility:** While exclusive to Mimikyu, it provides essential Fairy-type "nuke" potential to teams requiring a check to dominant Dragon-types like **Garchomp** or **Kommo-o**, and Dark-types like **Tyranitar**.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Mimikium Z** crystal, typically found in the Thrifty Megamart (Abandoned Site) after completing the trial. It is unavailable in Generation VIII and beyond due to the removal of Z-Move mechanics.
