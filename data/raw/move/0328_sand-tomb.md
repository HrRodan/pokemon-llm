## Identity & Mechanics
**Sand-Tomb** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user creates a swirling vortex of abrasive, heavy sand that collapses around the target, burying them in a grinding quicksand pit. This move is designed to pin an opponent in place, using the weight of the earth to prevent retreat while inflicting continuous grit-based damage over several intervals.
* **Effect:** Inflicts initial damage and traps the target for 4–5 turns (2–5 turns prior to Gen V). While trapped, the target cannot switch out or flee and takes 1/8th of their maximum HP in residual damage at the end of each turn (1/16th prior to Gen VI). The effect ends immediately if the user leaves the field or if the target uses Rapid Spin or Mortal Spin to clear the hazard.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the "Trapped" status condition for the duration of the move.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35, Accuracy 85%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Trapper (Partial Trapping).
* **Usage:** While its raw power is negligible compared to Earthquake or High Horsepower, Sand-Tomb is a specialized **Trapping** tool. It is used in "Perish Trap" or "Chip Damage" strategies to prevent a specific counter from switching out, allowing the user to whittle them down with residual damage or set up hazards. It is the Ground-type equivalent to moves like Whirlpool, Fire Spin, and Infestation. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Does not make contact; affected by Protect; blockable by Magic Guard (residual damage only).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (92 learners), primarily among Ground, Rock, and Steel types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by defensive stalwarts and tactical leads such as **Hippowdon**, **Garchomp**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Ting-Lu**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Scizor**, **Skarmory**, and **Glimmora**. In Glimmora’s case, it synergizes with Toxic Debris to trap a foe while they succumb to poison and Sand-Tomb's chip damage.
* **Acquisition:** It has seen a resurgence in availability as a **TM (Technical Machine)** in Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet, making it a common tech choice for competitive stall and hazard-stacking teams.
