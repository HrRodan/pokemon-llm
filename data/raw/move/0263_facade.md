## Identity & Mechanics
**Facade** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** The user puts up a front of strength while suffering from a status condition, delivering a desperate and powerful physical strike. This move is designed to turn a debilitating status ailment into a massive offensive advantage, characterized by the user "toughing it out" to overwhelm the opponent.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the user is currently **Burned, Paralyzed, or Poisoned** (including Badly Poisoned), the base power of this move is doubled from 70 to 140.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it possesses a unique hidden mechanic: starting in Generation VI, Facade **ignores the 50% Attack reduction** usually caused by the Burn status.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70 (140 if status-afflicted), Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Status-Condition Counter / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Facade is the premier choice for physical attackers that fear being shut down by **Will-O-Wisp** or **Toxic**. It is most effectively paired with the **Guts** ability and a held **Flame Orb** or **Toxic Orb**, essentially creating a 140-power STAB nuke that benefits from an additional 1.5x Attack multiplier. It is generally preferred over *Return* or *Double-Edge* on sets designed to absorb status.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **resisted by Rock and Steel** and has **no effect on Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (1,229 learners), making it one of the most widely available physical TMs in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Ursaluna / Ursaring:** The gold standard for Facade; its Guts ability and massive base Attack make its STAB-boosted, status-boosted Facade one of the hardest-hitting moves in the game.
    * **Swellow:** A classic "Guts-Facade" user that utilizes its high Speed to sweep while holding a Flame Orb.
    * **Conkeldurr:** Frequently runs Facade to punish opponents who try to neutralize its high Attack with Burn.
    * **Snorlax:** Often uses Facade to remain a threat even after being poisoned or paralyzed during a long stall-match.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on physical threats like **Garchomp**, **Lucario**, and **Salamence** in certain formats to ensure they remain offensive threats even after being hit by status-inflicting utility moves.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM (Technical Machine)** across almost every generation since its debut.
