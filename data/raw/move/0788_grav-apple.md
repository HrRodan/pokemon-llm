## Identity & Mechanics
**Grav Apple** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user utilizes the force of gravity to drop a dense, heavy apple from a great height onto the target. The high-velocity impact deals significant physical damage and effectively crushes the target's physical guard, making it a potent tool for bypassing defensive walls.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and is guaranteed to weaken the opponent's physical resilience.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s **Defense** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Defense Breaker.
* **Usage:** While it has a modest base power of 80, its guaranteed Defense drop makes it functionally stronger over consecutive turns, turning the user into a snowballing physical threat. In competitive play, it is most notable for its unique interaction with the field effect **Gravity**, which boosts Grav Apple's power by 1.5x (reaching 120 Base Power). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a physical attack involving a projectile, it is **not a contact move**, allowing the user to avoid chip damage from abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Flapple**. As Flapple's signature move, it is the cornerstone of its offensive sets, often paired with the ability Hustle to reach devastating damage levels, albeit at the cost of accuracy (which Grav Apple's base 100% helps mitigate).
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can access this move via TM, TR, or Breeding, making it a unique identifier for Flapple’s tactical niche.
* **Acquisition:** Learned naturally upon evolution or via leveling up in the Galar and Paldea regions.
