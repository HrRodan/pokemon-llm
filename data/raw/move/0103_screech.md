## Identity & Mechanics
**Screech** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user emits an ear-splitting, high-frequency shriek that unnerves the target and forces them to drop their guard. This piercing sound creates a psychological and physical opening, leaving the opponent highly vulnerable to physical strikes. As a **sound-based move**, it interacts with specific abilities like Soundproof.
* **Effect:** Sharply lowers the target's Defense stat by two stages (-2). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 85%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Utility / Wallbreaking Support.
* **Usage:** Screech is primarily used to facilitate a **Physical Nuke**. By cutting the opponent's Defense in half (at -2), it allows the user or a teammate to secure OHKOs on otherwise sturdy walls. While its 85% accuracy makes it a "High-Risk Utility" option compared to the 100% accurate but weaker Leer, the sheer magnitude of the debuff is superior for forcing switches. In modern VGC and Raids (Tera Raids/Max Raids), Screech is a premier choice for supporting physical attackers to bypass massive HP pools.
* **Context:** It is the physical counterpart to **Metal Sound** and **Fake Tears**. 
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (Blocked by Soundproof; bypasses Substitute in Generations VI+).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (248 learners), making it a common utility tool for aggressive physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic physical powerhouses like **Tyranitar**, **Feraligatr**, **Lucario**, and the Legendary **Koraidon** naturally learn or utilize this move to soften targets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon like **Toxtricity** (fitting its sound-based theme) and **Umbreon** to support teammates in doubles formats. It is frequently found on "fast but frail" leads like **Ninjask** or **Electrode** to provide a parting debuff before being knocked out.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** (specifically TR00 in Generation VIII), ensuring it can be tutored onto almost any Pokémon with a thematic reason to scream or screech.
