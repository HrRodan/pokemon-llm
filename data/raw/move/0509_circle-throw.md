## Identity & Mechanics
**Circle Throw** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user utilizes martial arts leverage and momentum to grab the opponent, spinning and hurling them out of the battlefield. This forceful ejection drags out a replacement from the opponent's party. In the wild, the sheer force of the throw ends the encounter immediately.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and forces the target to switch out for a random ally. It is a **Phazing** (pseudo-hazing) move. It fails if the target has a Substitute, the ability Suction Cups, the move Ingrain, or if the target is the last remaining Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** This move has a **Priority of -6**, ensuring the user moves last in the turn regardless of Speed, mirroring the "charging" nature of a counter-throw.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Phazing / Utility.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used by bulky defensive Pokémon to disrupt an opponent's momentum. Its main purpose is to **shuffle the opponent's team** through entry hazards like Stealth Rock, Spikes, or Toxic Spikes, racking up "chip" damage. It is also used to force out "setup sweepers" that have accumulated stat boosts. It is the Fighting-type counterpart to *Dragon Tail*, though it is blocked by Ghost-types unless the user has the *Scrappy* ability. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (12 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with a martial arts or grappling theme.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Poliwrath**, which uses its bulk to phaze opponents, and **Throh**, whose high HP makes it a natural "tank" for shuffling teams. In newer generations, **Spidops** uses it to capitalize on its own entry hazard setting.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Pangoro** and **Mega Kangaskhan**; thanks to the **Scrappy** ability, these Pokémon can use Circle Throw to hit and force out Ghost-types that would otherwise be immune to the move. 
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is very specific; it is rarely available as a TM/TR and is usually learned via level-up or as an Egg Move, making it a specialized tool rather than a universal coverage option.
