## Identity & Mechanics
**Fissure** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user strikes the ground with tectonic force, creating a massive, deep rupture in the earth’s crust directly beneath the opponent. This chasm swallows the target whole, resulting in an instant knockout. As an earthquake-themed move, it emphasizes raw power and environmental manipulation to bypass conventional durability.
* **Effect:** This is a One-Hit KO (OHKO) move. It inflicts damage equal to the target’s maximum HP. The move will automatically fail if the user's level is lower than the target's level. It ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers, meaning moves like Double Team or Sand Attack do not affect its success rate.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Immediate fainting upon a successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [OHKO], Accuracy 30%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Stall-Breaker / High-Risk Gamble / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Fissure is primarily utilized in competitive play to force progress against "unbreakable" defensive walls or Pokémon that have accumulated multiple defensive stat boosts (e.g., Cosmic Power or Iron Defense). While its 30% accuracy makes it unreliable, the threat of an instant KO can force an opponent to switch. It is notably blocked by the **Sturdy** ability and is completely ineffective against **Flying-types** or Pokémon with the **Levitate** ability.
* **Attributes:** One-Hit KO move. The accuracy increases by 1% for every level the user is above the target. It can be guaranteed to hit if used in conjunction with **Lock-On**, **Mind Reader**, or the **No Guard** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (67 learners), largely concentrated among heavy Ground-types and bulky physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly relevant on top-tier defensive threats like **Ting-Lu** and **Dondozo**, who use it to threaten KOs while soaking up hits. It is also a signature flavor move for **Groudon** and **Hippowdon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Snorlax** and **Lapras** (via legacy transfers or Gen I TMs) to provide them with a "panic button" against targets they cannot otherwise damage.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM27** in the Kanto region (Generation I). In modern games, it is typically learned via level-up by Ground-dwelling Pokémon or obtained as a rare Egg Move.
