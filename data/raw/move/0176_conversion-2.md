## Identity & Mechanics
**Conversion-2** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user reconfigures its internal code or molecular structure to defensively adapt to an opponent's assault. By analyzing the data of the last attack it sustained, the Pokémon programmatically shifts its elemental type to one that provides a tactical resistance or total immunity, acting as a digital "anti-virus" protocol.
* **Effect:** Changes the user’s current type to a different type that is either resistant to (0.5x damage) or immune to (0x damage) the type of the last damaging move that hit the user. The new type is selected at random from all eligible types, excluding types the user currently possesses. If no move has hit the user yet, or no eligible type exists, the move fails.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self (User).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 30 (Max 48).
* **Role:** Reactive Defensive Utility / Anti-Meta Tech.
* **Usage:** Unlike the offensive *Conversion*, which is typically used to gain STAB for a specific move, Conversion-2 is a purely defensive tool. It is most effective when used by bulky Pokémon to force "Not Very Effective" interactions, effectively stalling out opponents or forcing them to switch. In competitive play, it is often overshadowed by more consistent defensive moves like *Recover* or *Teleport*, but it can be a disruptive **Check** against Choice-locked attackers.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; fails if the user has not taken damage from a move during the current stint on the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (3 total learners), serving as a signature mechanic for the Porygon family.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Porygon2**, **Porygon-Z**, and **Porygon**.
* **Utility Context:** It is most commonly associated with **Porygon2** equipped with an **Eviolite**. By using Conversion-2, Porygon2 can augment its already massive defensive stats with a favorable type-matchup mid-turn, becoming a formidable **Wall** that is difficult to break without set-up. 
* **Acquisition:** This move is strictly limited to the Porygon evolutionary line via level-up and has never been available as a **TM** or **TR**.
