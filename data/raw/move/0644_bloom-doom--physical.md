## Identity & Mechanics
**Bloom Doom (Physical)** is a Physical Grass-type **Z-Move** introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** The user harnesses the concentrated Z-Power of nature, gathering bio-energy from surrounding plant life to manifest a devastating floral assault. This move represents the ultimate physical manifestation of Grass-type offense, often appearing as an explosion of vines, giant flowers, or overwhelming forest energy that crushes the opponent with absolute force.
* **Effect:** This move is a Z-Move that can only be used if the Pokémon holds a **Grassium Z** and knows a physical Grass-type move. Its base power is determined by the power of the original move (e.g., a move like Wood Hammer creates a significantly stronger Bloom Doom than Leafage).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, as a Z-Move, it **bypasses accuracy checks** (never misses) and can strike through protection moves like Protect or Detect, dealing 25% of its total damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** **One-time Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** In the Generation VII metagame, Bloom Doom served as a premier "panic button" or wallbreaking tool. It is used to bypass traditional Grass-type checks or to secure an OHKO on bulky Water or Ground-type threats that might otherwise survive a standard hit. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Being a Z-Move, it consumes the user's held item slot and can only be used once per battle. Unlike most physical moves, the Z-version typically does **not make contact**, avoiding effects like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move has a **Specialized distribution**; it is not learned by leveling up but is accessible to any Pokémon that knows a physical Grass-type move while holding a Grassium Z.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Kartana:** Utilizes its massive Attack stat and *Leaf Blade* to create a terrifyingly powerful Bloom Doom that can OHKO even neutral targets.
    * **Tapu Bulu:** Pairs its "Grassy Surge" Ability (which boosts Grass moves) with *Horn Leech* or *Wood Hammer* to reach astronomical damage tiers.
    * **Decidueye:** Often uses this as a high-powered physical alternative to its signature Spirit Shackle.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Grass types that carry Grass-type coverage, such as **Landorus-Therian** (using *Grass Knot*, though typically special) or physical attackers with access to *Seed Bomb* to lure and eliminate Water/Ground walls like Quagsire or Gastrodon.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Grassium Z** Crystal, obtained in the Lush Jungle during the Alola Island Challenge.
