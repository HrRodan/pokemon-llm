## Identity & Mechanics
**Ceaseless Edge** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically debuted in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user sheathes its blade in dark, jagged energy and delivers a ruthless slash with its shell. Beyond the initial impact, the move leaves behind jagged shell splinters that embed themselves into the battlefield. In standard competitive play, these splinters function as a layer of **Spikes**, damaging grounded opponents upon switching in.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and sets one layer of **Spikes** on the target's side of the field. This unique mechanic allows the user to pressure the opponent offensively while simultaneously building entry hazards.
* **Secondary Effect:** Increased critical hit ratio (Stage 1).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Hazard-Setting Offensive Pivot.**
* **Usage:** Ceaseless Edge is a top-tier utility move because it bypasses the traditional "passive" turn required to set entry hazards. Unlike the move *Spikes*, Ceaseless Edge cannot be blocked by *Taunt* (as it is an attacking move) and provides immediate board pressure. It is often compared to **Stone Axe**, which sets *Stealth Rock*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Slicing** move, meaning its base power is boosted by 50% (effectively becoming ~97.5 BP) when used by a Pokémon with the **Sharpness** ability. It makes direct contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, it is utilized exclusively by **Hisuian Samurott**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not seen as coverage on other types. However, on Hisuian Samurott, it serves as the primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, enabling it to function as a dedicated lead or "anti-hazard" pressure piece in the OU (Overused) tier.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it must be learned naturally by Hisuian Samurott.
