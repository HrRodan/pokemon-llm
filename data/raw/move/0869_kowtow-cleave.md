## Identity & Mechanics
**Kowtow Cleave** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user feigns submission by bowing low in a traditional kowtow gesture, deceiving the opponent into lowering their guard before delivering a sudden, lethal blade strike. This deceptive execution ensures the attack is unavoidable, cutting through shadows and illusions alike.
* **Effect:** This attack is guaranteed to hit the target regardless of Accuracy or Evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Signature Move.
* **Usage:** Kowtow Cleave serves as the primary, consistent Dark-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) for its user. In competitive play, it is often paired with *Sucker Punch*; while Sucker Punch provides necessary priority, Kowtow Cleave provides a "safe" mid-power button that cannot be bypassed by the opponent using status moves or accuracy-lowering tactics (like *Smokescreen* or *Sand Attack*). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Strength Sap. 

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is the signature move of the "Big Boss" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kingambit**. It represents the evolution of Bisharp into a shogun-like commander that uses guile and ruthless tactics to win.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is currently unavailable to other Pokémon. However, on Kingambit, it provides essential neutral coverage against the majority of the tier, resisted only by Dark, Fighting, and Fairy types.
* **Acquisition:** Learned upon evolution or via level-up by Kingambit; it is not available as a TM or Move Tutor instruction.
