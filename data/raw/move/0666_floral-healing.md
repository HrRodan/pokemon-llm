## Identity & Mechanics
**Floral Healing** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user surrounds an ally with a fragrant, magically-infused wreath of flowers, releasing a soothing pollen that instantly restores vitality. This nature-based rejuvenation is significantly amplified when the battlefield is covered in lush greenery, making it a cornerstone of terrain-based strategies.
* **Effect:** Restores the target's HP by 50% of its maximum HP. If **Grassy Terrain** is active on the field, the healing amount increases to approximately 66.7% (2/3) of the target's maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Typically an ally in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **High-Impact Support / Cleric.**
* **Usage:** Floral Healing is a specialized support move primarily designed for Double Battles (VGC). It serves as an upgraded version of *Heal Pulse*; while both provide 50% recovery, Floral Healing’s synergy with **Grassy Terrain** allows it to outpace standard healing moves. It is most effective when paired with bulky setup sweepers or "Stall" archetypes to negate offensive pressure. Because it is a Fairy-type move, it cannot be blocked by *Dark-type* Pokémon’s immunity to *Prankster*, though its primary user utilizes a different priority mechanic.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses Accuracy and Evasion checks.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, functioning as a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Comfey**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it has no coverage users, its utility is defined by Comfey's ability, **Triage**. This ability grants Floral Healing **+3 Priority**, allowing the user to heal an ally before almost any offensive move (including *Extreme Speed*) can connect. This makes it a premier tool for sustaining partners like **Kyogre**, **Groudon**, or **Iron Hands** in high-level competitive play.
* **Acquisition:** Unique to the Comfey evolutionary line via level-up; it is not available as a TM, TR, or through Move Tutors in any generation.
