## Identity & Mechanics
**Poison Tail** is a physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user lashes out with a barbed or venomous tail to strike the target. This attack is designed to find openings in the opponent's guard, characterized by a whipping motion that delivers toxic fluids directly into the foe's bloodstream.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage. This move possesses an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage), making it more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages and Screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to induce the **Poison** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Critical-Hit Fisher.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Poison Tail is generally considered a niche pick due to its low base power. It is almost strictly outclassed by **Poison Jab** (80 Power) for reliability or **Gunk Shot** (120 Power) for raw wallbreaking potential. It is primarily utilized by Pokémon with the **Sniper** ability (to capitalize on the crit ratio) or in lower-tier formats where high-power options are unavailable. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**. Affected by Protect, Mirror Move, and King's Rock.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (41 learners), primarily found among serpentine Pokémon or those with prominent caudal appendages.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Seviper** (often seen as its signature move), **Scolipede**, **Arbok**, and the legendary **Eternatus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Dragon-types such as **Goodra** and **Druddigon** or Ground-types like **Gliscor** and **Sandaconda** to provide a niche answer to Fairy-type switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** While historically learned via leveling up for most users, it was reintroduced as **TM026** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), increasing its accessibility for physical attackers needing Fairy-type coverage.
