## Identity & Mechanics
**Steel Beam** is a Special Steel-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user focuses its entire metallic essence, harvesting steel from its own body to fire a massive, concentrated beam of energy at the target. This extreme expenditure of internal resources causes the user to suffer significant structural damage. This move is the Steel-type equivalent of high-recoil special nukes like *Mind Blown* or *Chloroblast*.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. The user takes recoil damage equal to **50% of its maximum HP**, rounded up.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the recoil is a **mandatory mechanic**: the user will still lose 50% of its HP even if the move misses, is blocked by *Protect*, or if the target is immune (e.g., due to an ability like *Flash Fire* via mimicry or *Good as Gold*).
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 95%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Steel Beam is the ultimate "last resort" or "nuke" option for Special Steel-type attackers. It is significantly more powerful than **Flash Cannon** (80 Power), but the 50% HP cost makes it difficult to use more than once or twice. It is often used in competitive play to secure a crucial OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) on bulky Fairy or Ice types, or as a way for a weakened Pokémon to "faint with value" to bring in a teammate safely. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, beam-based move. It is not affected by *Iron Fist* but can be boosted by items like *Choice Specs* or *Life Orb* for catastrophic damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Steel-types, with **85 total learners** as of the latest generation.
* **Prominent Users:** Heavily utilized by **Duraludon** and its evolution **Archaludon**, **Gholdengo** (as a secondary nuke to *Make It Rain*), and **Dialga**. 
* **Competitive Synergy:** Pokémon with the **Sturdy** ability (like **Magnezone** or **Skarmory**) can sometimes use this to guarantee a hit from 1 HP, effectively turning themselves into a one-time tactical missile.
* **Coverage Utility:** While primarily learned by Steel-types, **Mew** and **Silvally** can access it to provide high-base-power coverage against Fairy-type threats like *Clefable* or *Flutter Mane*.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in *Sword & Shield* (Steel-type master in Motostoke), it has since become available via **TM/TR** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
