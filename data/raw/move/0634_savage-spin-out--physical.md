## Identity & Mechanics
**Savage Spin-Out (Physical)** is a Physical Bug-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** This move represents the ultimate cinematic manifestation of Bug-type kinetic energy. By channeling Z-Power through a Buginium Z crystal, the user generates massive quantities of reinforced silken threads to bind and constrict the target before delivering a high-velocity finishing strike. The visual execution often involves the target being cocooned and spun at intense speeds, making it a powerful "finishing move" keyword for retrieval.
* **Effect:** This move is a Z-Move transformation of a base physical Bug-type move. It inflicts massive damage and bypasses standard accuracy checks. If the target uses a protection move (like Protect or Detect), this move still deals 25% of its total power.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Z-Moves typically lose the secondary effects of their base moves in favor of raw power).
* **Targeting:** Single-target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** As a one-time-use tactical nuke, Savage Spin-Out is designed to eliminate a specific threat that would otherwise wall a Pokémon's standard STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) options. It is significantly more powerful than its base moves, such as **Leech Life** or **X-Scissor**, allowing physical attackers to brute-force their way through bulky opponents. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Z-Move; it cannot be intercepted by most protection moves at full effectiveness and ignores accuracy/evasion modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution among Pokémon capable of learning physical Bug-type moves, though it requires the holder to carry a **Buginium Z** crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Scizor**, **Buzzwole**, and **Golisopod** to turn their high Attack stats into a specialized "one-shot" tool. **Pheromosa** also utilizes this to punish defensive switch-ins.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen as a "tech" choice on **Kartana**, which uses Buginium Z (scaling off X-Scissor) to lure and OHKO (One-Hit Knock Out) traditional counters like Mega Slowbro, Tangrowth, or Zapdos.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not learned by leveling up; it is only accessible in Pokémon Sun, Moon, Ultra Sun, and Ultra Moon by giving a Pokémon with a physical Bug-type move the **Buginium Z** held item.
