## Identity & Mechanics
**Alluring Voice** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a captivating, melodic aria or an angelic vocal performance that resonates with fairy-like energy. Because it is a sound-based move, it vibrates through physical barriers, allowing it to bypass and strike targets behind a **Substitute**.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and inflicts the **Confusion** status condition on the target, but only if the target has had its stats raised during the same turn the move is used.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to confuse (conditional upon the target boosting stats that turn).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Setup Utility.
* **Usage:** While it has lower raw power than *Moonblast* (95 BP), Alluring Voice serves as a specialized tool to punish "Set-up Sweepers." It is particularly effective against Pokémon using moves like Dragon Dance, Calm Mind, or Quiver Dance, as it guarantees confusion to disrupt their momentum. As a **Sound-based move**, it is a direct upgrade over *Dazzling Gleam* in single battles for its ability to ignore Substitutes, though it is completely walled by the **Soundproof** ability. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based (Bypasses Substitute, blocked by Soundproof).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (67 learners), primarily given to Pokémon with themes of singing, beauty, or mystical voices.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Primarina** (who benefits from STAB and voice-move synergy), **Sylveon**, **Gardevoir**, and **Enamorus**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Seen on non-Fairy Pokémon such as **Skeledirge**, **Milotic**, and **Flygon** to provide Special Fairy-type coverage against Dragon and Dark-type threats. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM227** in the Generation IX DLC (*The Indigo Disk*), making it highly accessible to a vast array of Special Attackers.
