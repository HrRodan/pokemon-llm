## Identity & Mechanics
**Rock Polish** is a Status Rock-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user meticulously polishes its rugged or metallic exterior to eliminate surface friction and atmospheric drag. By smoothing its body to a mirror-like finish, the user significantly enhances its aerodynamics, allowing for a sudden and dramatic burst of velocity.
* **Effect:** Sharply raises the user’s Speed stat by two stages (+2).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Speed Setup / Late-Game Sweeper Enabler.
* **Usage:** Rock Polish is the premier speed-fixing tool for bulky, naturally slow threats. By doubling the user's Speed in a single turn, it allows "wallbreakers" to transition into "sweepers," effectively bypassing their primary weakness. It is the Rock-type equivalent to **Agility**, though it is often found on Pokémon with much higher base Attack stats. In competitive play, it is frequently used on "Double Dance" sets (pairing it with a damage-boosting move like Swords Dance) to make a Pokémon unmatchable in the late game. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal direct damage; however, it is essential for allowing slow Rock, Ground, and Steel types to move before their traditional checks.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; categorized as a non-contact, internal buff.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (144 learners), primarily concentrated among Rock, Ground, and Steel-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Groudon** (and its Primal form), **Metagross**, **Terrakion**, and **Rhyperior**. These Pokémon possess massive Power but middling Speed; a single Rock Polish allows them to outspeed almost the entire unboosted metagame.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Rock Pokémon like **Genesect**, **Landorus-Therian**, and **Mew** to surprise opponents who expect a slower, defensive variant, allowing them to "clean up" weakened teams.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM69** in Generations IV through VII, making it a staple setup option for a vast array of physical attackers during those eras.
