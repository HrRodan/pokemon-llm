## Identity & Mechanics
**Thrash** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user loses all composure and goes on a violent, uncontrollable rampage, striking the target with brute force repeatedly. This frantic state lasts for two to three turns, during which the user cannot be commanded to use other moves or switch out. The sheer exhaustion and mental tax of the outburst leave the user confused once the rampage concludes.
* **Effect:** The user is locked into using Thrash for 2–3 consecutive turns. If the move is successful, the user becomes Confused after the final turn. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to induce **Confusion** on the user after the sequence ends.
* **Targeting:** Random Opponent (in Double/Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Physical Wallbreaker / Nuke.
* **Usage:** Thrash is the Normal-type equivalent of *Outrage* and *Petal Dance*. While its 120 Base Power is massive, it is rarely seen in top-tier competitive play due to the **Lock-in** mechanic. Being locked into a Normal-type move is exceptionally dangerous, as it allows the opponent to freely switch in a **Ghost-type** (for an immunity) or a **Steel/Rock-type** (for a resistance) to set up while the user is helpless. It is primarily used by Pokémon with the **Own Tempo** ability, which negates the self-confusion.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but provides **no Super Effective coverage**.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, and King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (126 learners), primarily found among aggressive or "beast-like" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Tauros**, **Ursaring/Ursaluna**, **Nidoking**, and **Annihilape**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by **Gyarados** and **Tyranitar** as a high-power neutral hitting tool in earlier generations before their specialized movepools were expanded. It is a staple on **Own Tempo** users like **Lickilicky** or **Mudsdale** to bypass the confusion drawback.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via Level Up; it is notably absent from TM/TR lists in most generations, making it a specialized part of a Pokémon's natural kit.
