## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Knuckle** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** A powerful Dynamax-enhanced strike where the user channels intense martial energy into a colossal physical blow. This move manifests as an aura-infused punch or kick that ripples across the battlefield, not only damaging the target but also invigorating the user and their allies with increased combat spirit.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and raises the Attack stat of the user and all allied Pokémon by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise Attack (including allies in Double Battles).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Enemy); Buffs entire allied side.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales: 70–100], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Setup Nuke / Snowball Tool.**
* **Usage:** Unlike most Max Moves which feature massive Base Power (often 130+), Max Knuckle is intentionally balanced with lower Power (typically capping at 95-100) to compensate for its incredibly potent secondary effect. It is a staple in **VGC (Doubles)** and **Singles** for physical sweepers to "self-boost" while attacking, turning a potential KO into a setup opportunity. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; power scales based on the base Fighting-type move used to trigger it.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can Dynamax and possess a Physical Fighting-type move.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Urshifu (both Styles)**, who uses it to break through defensive cores, **Lucario**, and **Machamp (Gigantamax)**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Fighting physical attackers like **Cinderace** (via High Jump Kick/Libero) and **Tyranitar** (via Superpower/Low Kick) to bypass the Defense of Steel and Rock types while simultaneously boosting their own offensive pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Accessible to any Pokémon capable of Dynamaxing that knows a physical Fighting-type move (via Level up, TM, or Move Tutor).
