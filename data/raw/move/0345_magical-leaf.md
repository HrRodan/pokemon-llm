## Identity & Mechanics
**Magical Leaf** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user conjures and scatters a barrage of glowing, magically-imbued leaves that home in on the target. These leaves are guided by a mystical force, allowing them to weave through obstacles and track moving targets with unerring precision. This "never-miss" property makes it a reliable tool for bypassing defensive illusions or environmental hazards.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move is unique in that it ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring the attack lands regardless of the target's Evasion boosts (e.g., Minimize) or the user's Accuracy drops (e.g., Sand Attack).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy —% (Always Hits), PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Precision Chip / Evasion Counter.
* **Usage:** While its Base Power is relatively low compared to staples like **Energy Ball** (90) or **Leaf Storm** (130), Magical Leaf serves as a vital "Consistency Option." It is primarily used in lower-tier play or during the main story to counter "Accuracy Hax" strategies. In competitive formats, it is often overlooked for **Giga Drain** due to the lack of recovery, but it remains a niche check against Minimize-stackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks. Does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution with **151** total learners, making it one of the most accessible Grass-type coverage moves for Special Attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Meowscarada**, **Serperior**, and the mythical **Celebi** as a reliable early-to-mid-game STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Grass Pokémon such as **Flutter Mane**, **Espeon**, and **Hatterene**. These Psychic and Ghost types use it to provide crucial coverage against heavy Water and Ground types that might otherwise wall their primary attacks.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available via **TM/TR** in modern generations (TM10 in Sword/Shield; TM033 in Scarlet/Violet), ensuring easy access for most Special-leaning Pokémon.
