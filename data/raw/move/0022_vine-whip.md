## Identity & Mechanics
**Vine Whip** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lashes out at the target by extending long, slender, whip-like vines or tentacles from its body. As a foundational Grass-type technique, it represents one of the most basic forms of botanical combat, emphasizing speed and physical contact over elemental energy.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 45, Accuracy 100%, PP 25.
* **Role:** Early-Game STAB / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Vine Whip is virtually non-existent as it is strictly outclassed by more powerful Physical Grass options such as **Seed Bomb**, **Leaf Blade**, or **Power Whip**. Its primary value lies in the early "main story" phase of the games, providing reliable accuracy for young Grass-type starters. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Strength Sap*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (32 learners), primarily concentrated among Pokémon with vine-like physiology.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with the **Bulbasaur line** (Venusaur), as well as the **Chikorita** and **Snivy** starter families. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Fairy-types like **Comfey** and the **Flabébé** line during early levels, though they rarely maintain it in their final movesets.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned via **Level Up**. It has rarely been featured as a TM or Move Tutor option, making it a "natural" move for plant-based organisms. It is notably used by the Mythical Pokémon **Zarude** and the legendary **Ogerpon** in their base movepools.
