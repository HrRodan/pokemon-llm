## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Storm** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically appearing in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user summons a localized, cataclysmic vortex of corrupted purple and black energy that engulfs the entire opposing side of the field. As a Shadow move, it represents the pinnacle of atmospheric dark power, appearing as a chaotic gale of shadows that batters the targets with intense, unnatural force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent opponents. In the context of *Pokémon XD*, Shadow moves are uniquely "Super Effective" against all non-Shadow Pokémon and "Not Very Effective" against other Shadow Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Opponents' Field (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP [N/A].
* **Role:** High-Consistency Spread Nuke.
* **Usage:** Within its home game, Shadow Storm is the strongest special-category Shadow move available. Because it targets both opponents in a Double Battle without the damage reduction typical of standard spread moves like Surf (in Gen III), it serves as a premier board-clearer. It is the Shadow-type equivalent to a high-accuracy "nuke," bypassing the traditional type chart to hit almost every target for massive damage.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow Pokémon**.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Shadow-type move and is restricted to the *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness* engine; it cannot be traded or used in standard handheld titles.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, as it is a unique move tied to the "Shadow Pokémon" mechanic.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Shadow Lugia (Codename: XD001)**. It serves as the signature move for the game's central antagonist Pokémon, reflecting its role as the ultimate corrupted being. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its nature as a Shadow move, it provides perfect "Shadow coverage" against the entire standard Pokédex, making it impossible to naturally resist unless the opponent is also a Shadow Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be learned via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is hardcoded to specific Shadow Pokémon (primarily Shadow Lugia) upon their encounter.
