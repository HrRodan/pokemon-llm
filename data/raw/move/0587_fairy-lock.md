## Identity & Mechanics
**Fairy Lock** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user releases a burst of mystical, locking energy across the battlefield, creating a shimmering barrier that seals all exits. This magical interference prevents any Pokémon currently on the field—including the user—from fleeing or being switched out by their trainers during the following turn.
* **Effect:** Prevents all Pokémon on the field from switching out or fleeing during the turn immediately following the move's use. Unlike Mean Look, this effect is field-wide rather than target-specific.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (Affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Strategic Trapping / Utility.
* **Usage:** Fairy Lock is a niche **Trapping** tool used to force a specific matchup or prevent an opponent from **Pivoting** out (using moves like U-turn, Volt Switch, or Flip Turn) to a check or counter. It is often compared to moves like *Mean Look* or *Block*; however, its unique "next turn" mechanic allows for "trap-and-sacrifice" plays or setting up a teammate to revenge kill a locked-in threat. Because it is a Fairy-type move, it is flavorfully associated with magical entrapment.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the field.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, functioning as a **Signature Move** (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Klefki**. 
* **Competitive Synergy:** On **Klefki**, this move gains immense utility due to the Ability **Prankster**, which grants the move +1 Priority. This allows Klefki to "lock" the field before the opponent can naturally switch out manually, ensuring they remain on the field for the subsequent turn to be hit by a status move or a teammate's incoming attack.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature status move, it is never used for coverage but rather as a specialized disruption tool to punish passive play or "Choice-locked" attackers.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it must be learned naturally by Klefki via leveling up.
