## Identity & Mechanics
**Confuse Ray** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user emits a sinister, flickering beam of light or a disorienting flash from its eyes that overwhelms the target's senses. This eerie radiation leaves the foe in a state of deep mental instability, causing them to become confused and potentially injure themselves in their disorientation.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Confusion** status condition on the target. A confused Pokémon has a 33% chance (in modern generations) to attack itself instead of using its intended move. The damage taken from confusion is treated as a 40-power Physical attack.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the status induction).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (None), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Confuse Ray is the "Gold Standard" for confusion-inducing moves due to its perfect accuracy, making it significantly more reliable than **Supersonic** (55% accuracy) or **Sweet Kiss** (75% accuracy). While confusion has been nerfed in later generations, it remains a potent tool for forcing switches or creating "free turns" for setup. It is often paired with Paralysis (the "Para-Fusion" strategy) to minimize the opponent's chance of successfully moving to approximately 37.5%.
* **Attributes:** As a Status move, it bypasses the standard Ghost-type immunity against Normal-type Pokémon. It is blocked by **Magic Coat**, **Magic Bounce**, and the **Safeguard** or **Misty Terrain** conditions.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (211 learners), traditionally associated with Ghost, Psychic, and Poison types.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Gengar** and **Crobat** as a fast disruption tool. It is also a staple on defensive pivots like **Umbreon**, **Lapras**, and **Rotom (all forms)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Ninetales** and **Lanturn** to provide utility against threats they cannot otherwise wallbreak. In recent competitive play, **Flutter Mane** and **Gholdengo** may utilize it to disrupt mirrors or forced switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available through leveling up for supernatural or nocturnal Pokémon; it returned as a **TM (TM017)** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), further increasing its ubiquity in the competitive circuit.
