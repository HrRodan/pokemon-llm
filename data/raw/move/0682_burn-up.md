## Identity & Mechanics
**Burn Up** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user unleashes its entire internal reservoir of thermal energy in a single, catastrophic explosion of heat. This move is so intense that it literally consumes the user's elemental essence; the Pokémon "burns itself out," losing its Fire-type identity and becoming typeless (or losing the Fire-half of its dual typing) for the remainder of the battle or until switched out.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. After damage calculation, the user’s Fire typing is removed. If the user is a pure Fire-type, it becomes "typeless." If the move is used by a Pokémon that is not currently a Fire-type (either because it already used the move or via type-changing effects), the move will fail.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The type-removal is a primary mechanic/drawback).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Powered Tactical Nuke.
* **Usage:** Burn Up serves as a high-accuracy alternative to *Fire Blast* and *Overheat*. While *Overheat* lowers Special Attack, Burn Up alters the user’s defensive profile. This can be used strategically to shed weaknesses; for example, a Fire/Flying type like **Moltres** can use Burn Up to lose its Fire typing, thereby removing its 4x weakness to Rock-type moves. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Grass, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. Does not trigger most protection-based abilities but is hindered by *Flash Fire* (which grants immunity and a boost to the opponent).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, restricted primarily to specific Fire-type families (12 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on **Arcanine**, **Moltres**, and **Typhlosion**. These Pokémon utilize the 130 base power to punch through specially defensive walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to the mechanic requiring the user to be a Fire-type for the move to successfully execute, it is almost exclusively used as a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option rather than a coverage move for non-Fire types. **Coalossal** and **Centiskorch** may use it to pivot their defensive typing in specific competitive matchups.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it is not available via TM or TR. It is primarily learned through leveling up at high stages or as an Egg Move in specific generations.
