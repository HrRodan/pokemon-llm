## Identity & Mechanics
**Flatter** is a Status Dark-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user showers the target with insincere praise and sycophantic compliments, overwhelming their ego to the point of mental instability. This psychological manipulation causes the target to become confused while simultaneously inflating their Special Attack power due to a surge in overconfidence. 
* **Effect:** Raises the target’s Special Attack stat by one stage and then inflicts the Confusion status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The stat boost is a guaranteed part of the move's primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** High-Risk Utility / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Flatter is the Special-attacking counterpart to Swagger. In competitive play, it is generally considered higher risk and lower reward than Swagger because confusion damage scales with the target's Physical Attack stat; thus, boosting the target's Special Attack does not increase the self-inflicted damage they take while confused. It is occasionally used in niche "Mirror Herb" or "Psych Up" strategies to bait a stat boost and then steal it. As a Dark-type status move, it is blocked by targets with the **Good as Gold** ability or those behind a **Substitute**.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses accuracy checks if used by a Pokémon with No Guard, though its base accuracy is already a reliable 100%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily concentrated among "tricky," "mean," or "charismatic" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Grimmsnarl**, **Sableye**, **Nidoking**, and **Tinkaton**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon with the **Prankster** ability, such as **Murkrow** or **Illumise**, allowing them to use Flatter with priority to disrupt a foe before they can move.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is somewhat restricted; it is rarely a TM/TR and is usually learned through level-up or as an Egg Move in most generations.
