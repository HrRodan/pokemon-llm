## Identity & Mechanics
**Purify** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user releases a cleansing, revitalizing energy to purge toxins, burns, or other debilitating ailments from a target. By successfully neutralizing the target's status condition, the user absorbs the residual energy to drastically rejuvenate its own health and stamina.
* **Effect:** Cures the target of its major status ailment (Burn, Freeze, Paralysis, Poison, or Sleep). If the status is successfully cured, the user restores 50% of its maximum HP. The move fails if the target does not have a major status ailment.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (can target an ally in Doubles or an opponent in Singles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Niche Recovery / Conditional Support.
* **Usage:** Purify is a highly specialized recovery tool. Unlike **Recover** or **Soft-Boiled**, which are reliable, Purify is a "conditional" heal. In Singles, it is often paired with **Toxic**; the user poisons the foe and then uses Purify to heal itself while resetting the opponent's status. In Doubles, it can be used to heal an ally's status (such as a Burn on a Physical attacker) while simultaneously keeping the user healthy. It is generally considered inferior to standard recovery moves due to its dependency on the target's state.
* **Attributes:** As a Status move, it is blocked by **Taunt**. It does not check accuracy and will always hit unless the target is semi-invulnerable (e.g., using Fly or Dig) or protected by Substitute.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the **Signature Move** of only one Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Pyukumuku**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to a single Pokémon, it has no coverage utility among other types. On Pyukumuku, it defines its identity as a pure "Stall" or "Support" Pokémon that lacks direct attacking moves.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned only through level-up by its sole practitioner.
