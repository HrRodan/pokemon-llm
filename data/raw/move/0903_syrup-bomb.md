## Identity & Mechanics
**Syrup Bomb** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Teal Mask).
* **Description:** The user launches a projectile of highly viscous, explosive candy syrup. Upon impact, the target is coated in a sticky, sugary substance that hampers movement. This creates a lingering debuff effect where the target's Speed stat is progressively lowered over several turns, making it a potent tool for long-term speed control and forcing switches.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and coats the target in syrup. This coating causes the target's Speed stat to drop by one stage at the end of each turn for a total of three turns. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the Speed-dropping "Syrup" status.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 85%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low and its accuracy is somewhat shaky (comparable to Fire Blast or Hydro Pump without the high damage), Syrup Bomb is used primarily for its unique **Lingering Speed Control**. Unlike *Icy Wind* or *Electroweb*, which provide an immediate drop, Syrup Bomb creates a "snowball" effect that punishes Pokémon that stay on the field. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a projectile/bomb-based move, meaning it is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), serving as the signature move for the Applin evolutionary line introduced in the Hidden Treasure of Area Zero DLC.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Dipplin** and its evolution **Hydrapple**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Grass Pokémon can learn this move, as it is a specialized signature attack. It is most effective when used by **Hydrapple** to force an opponent to switch, potentially racking up entry hazard damage or allowing Hydrapple to outspeed threats on subsequent turns.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned naturally by Dipplin upon evolution or via level-up for Hydrapple.
