## Identity & Mechanics
**Gust** is a Special Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user flaps its wings or uses its body to whip up a concentrated, spiraling vortex of air. This strong gust of wind buffet the target from a distance, making it a staple aerodynamic attack for avian and insectoid Pokémon. While it was originally classified as a Normal-type move in its debut, it was updated to Flying-type in Generation II to align with its thematic nature.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is in the semi-invulnerable state of a two-turn move such as **Fly**, **Bounce**, or **Sky Drop**, Gust bypasses the invulnerability and deals **double damage** (80 Base Power).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Niche Anti-Air.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Gust is rarely used due to its low base power, usually being replaced by more potent options like **Air Slash** (for flinching) or **Hurricane** (for raw power). Its primary utility lies in early-game progression or very specific niche scenarios where a Pokémon needs to punish an opponent using Fly. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass**, **Fighting**, and **Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. It is considered a wind-based move in later generations, interacting with abilities like **Wind Power** or **Wind Rider**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among winged creatures (67 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by the **Pidgeot** line, **Staraptor** line, and the Legendary birds **Lugia** and **Ho-Oh** as a natural level-up move.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-traditional "Bird" Pokémon like **Volcarona**, **Flygon**, and **Iron Moth**, providing them with thematic wind-based utility or early-game Special STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up; it is notably absent from **TM/TR** lists in most generations, making it a "natural" move for Flying-types.
