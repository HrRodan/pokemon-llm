## Identity & Mechanics
**Hyperspace Hole** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos region).
* **Description:** The user utilizes its interdimensional rings to create a localized wormhole, manifesting instantly beside the target to deliver a surprise telekinetic strike. This move is flavored around the mythical Pokémon Hoopa’s ability to warp space, making the attack unavoidable as it literally bypasses the physical distance and any barriers between the user and the opponent.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and completely ignores the effects of protection moves. Furthermore, it **removes** the protection effect from the target for the remainder of the turn, allowing teammates to land hits in Doubles play.
* **Secondary Effect:** Bypasses accuracy checks (never-miss) and breaks through moves like Protect, Detect, King’s Shield, Spiky Shield, Mat Block, and Baneful Bunker.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy —% (Never-Miss), PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Protection Breaker / Utility STAB.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than *Psychic* (90) or *Psyshock* (80 vs Defense), Hyperspace Hole is a premier **Utility STAB** move, especially in VGC or Doubles formats. Its ability to punish "Protect-spam" makes it a terrifying presence for defensive cores. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is non-contact. Its primary value lies in its "Shield-Dusting" property, ensuring that the user's offensive pressure cannot be stalled out by traditional defensive pivoting.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, as it is the **Signature Move** of Hoopa (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Hoopa (Confined)** and **Hoopa-Unbound**. On Hoopa-Unbound, it serves as a reliable Special STAB option that complements its massive Special Attack stat.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Hoopa, it is not used for coverage by other types. However, Hoopa uses it to specifically counter **Fighting-types** like **Conkeldurr** or **Poison-types** like **Toxapex** that might otherwise rely on protection to scout Hoopa's item (like Choice Specs).
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR; it is learned by Hoopa upon reaching level 1 or via the Move Reminder. In some games, it is tied to Hoopa's specific form-change events.
