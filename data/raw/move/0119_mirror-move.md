## Identity & Mechanics
**Mirror Move** is a Status Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user observes the opponent's technique and immediately replicates it, mirroring the exact move that was last directed at them. This tactical maneuver allows the user to turn an opponent's offensive or utility prowess against themselves, effectively expanding the user's movepool mid-battle with the opponent's own repertoire.
* **Effect:** Executes the last move targeted at the user by a Pokémon still on the field. The move succeeds even if the original move missed, was blocked by a protection move, or had no effect. However, it will fail if the user has not been targeted yet or if the move targeted the entire field rather than the user specifically.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (The move's effects are dependent on the move it copies).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (mirrors the move of the specific attacker).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Tactical Utility / Counter-Attacker.
* **Usage:** Mirror Move is a high-variance "Reactionary Move." Its primary competitive niche appeared in Generation VII as **Z-Mirror Move**, which granted the user a massive **+2 Attack boost** before executing the copied move, turning it into a powerful setup tool for physical attackers. In standard play, it is used to punish predictable high-power attacks or to gain access to coverage moves the user does not naturally possess. It deals **Super Effective** damage dynamically based on the move it copies (e.g., mirroring a Thunderbolt to hit a Water-type).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (as a status move); cannot be called by Metronome, Assist, or Sleep Talk.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (29 total learners), almost exclusively restricted to avian or "mimic" themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Mega Pidgeot**, **Fearow**, and **Mandibuzz**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Blaziken** and **Tapu Koko** in specific Z-Move sets to capitalize on the +2 Attack boost while reflecting an opponent's STAB move back at them.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it has never been a widely available TM or TR, making it a "signature" trait of bird-like Pokémon.
