## Identity & Mechanics
**Spotlight** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user projects a blinding, focused beam of light onto a specific Pokémon on the battlefield. This sudden illumination forces all other active Pokémon to fixate on the illuminated target, making them the irresistible center of attention for the remainder of the turn. This move is designed to manipulate the flow of combat by redirecting the opposition's offensive pressure.
* **Effect:** For the duration of the turn, any move used by an opponent that could potentially hit the target will be redirected to hit that target. Essentially, it acts as a targeted "Follow Me" or "Rage Powder" effect that can be placed on any Pokémon on the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Priority:** +3 (Ensures the effect is active before most offensive moves are executed).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Can target an ally or an opponent).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Disruption Utility / Redirection Support.
* **Usage:** Primarily a niche tool in Doubles and VGC formats. While **Follow Me** and **Rage Powder** redirect attacks to the user, Spotlight allows for more complex tactical plays. For example, it can be used on an opponent’s bulky teammate to force their heavy hitter to waste an attack on its own ally, or used on a sturdy ally to protect a frail "glass cannon" teammate. Because it has **+3 Priority**, it outspeeds almost all standard attacks and lower-priority redirection.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **Status** move and does not deal damage, therefore it does not have type-effectiveness matchups. It is blocked by **Protect**, **Detect**, and the ability **Dazzling** or **Queenly Majesty** if used by a priority-hating opponent.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (only 7 Pokémon in the national dex can learn this move).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with **Clefairy** and **Clefable**, who utilize it alongside their legendary bulk and supportive movepools. It is also the signature-style move for the Alolan mushroom Pokémon **Shiinotic**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Lanturn** or **Starmie** in niche Doubles sets to provide redirection support in archetypes where standard redirectors (like Togekiss or Amoonguss) don't fit.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it is not available via **TM/TR/HM** in any generation and is typically learned only via Level Up or Egg Move.
