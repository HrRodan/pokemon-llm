## Identity & Mechanics
**Poltergeist** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user exerts telekinetic control over the target's held item, causing the object to violently strike its owner. This move manifests as a paranormal phenomenon where items like Leftovers, Choice Scarf, or Life Orb are imbued with spectral energy and launched as projectiles. Because it relies on the target's possessions, the move fails entirely if the target is not holding an item.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high physical damage. Upon execution, the game text reveals the target's held item (e.g., "The target's Choice Band was attacked!"). The move fails if the target has no held item, has already consumed their item (like a Berry or Focus Sash), or had it removed via *Knock Off* or *Thief*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (but functions as an **Item Scout**).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Poltergeist serves as the premier high-power Physical Ghost-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move, filling a long-standing void for physical attackers who previously relied on the weak *Shadow Claw* or the two-turn *Phantom Force*. While its 110 Power is devastating, it is hindered by a shaky 90% accuracy and the "No Item" failure condition. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; ignores effects like *Rocky Helmet* or *Rough Skin*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (71 learners), primarily concentrated among Ghost-type specialists and supernatural-themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely utilized by physical powerhouses such as **Ceruledge**, **Marowak-Alola**, **Golurk**, and **Brambleghast**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ghost Pokémon like **Munkidori** or **Typhlosion-Hisui** to provide heavy neutral coverage against the tier's bulky Psychic-type threats.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in the *Sword & Shield* Isle of Armor DLC, it is now available as a **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
