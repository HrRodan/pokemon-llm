## Identity & Mechanics
**Aromatherapy** is a status Grass-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user releases a soothing, botanical fragrance that permeates the battlefield, acting as a natural remedy for the entire team. This calming scent provides immediate relief from debilitating conditions, restoring the physical and mental state of all allies in the party.
* **Effect:** Cures all Pokémon in the user’s party—including those currently in their Poké Balls—of major status conditions (Sleep, Poison, Burn, Paralysis, and Freeze) and Confusion.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User and all allies (Party-wide).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Team Utility / Cleric Support.**
* **Usage:** Aromatherapy is the quintessential "Cleric" move, used to negate the progress an opponent has made via status-spreading moves like *Toxic*, *Will-O-Wisp*, or *Thunder Wave*. It is functionally identical to *Heal Bell*, though as a Grass-type move, it can be absorbed by Pokémon with the **Sap Sipper** ability, which will negate the healing effect for the team. Its low PP requires careful management in long stalls or defensive pivots.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it deals no damage and does not have Super Effective modifiers.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Unlike its rival *Heal Bell*, it is **not** sound-based, meaning it is not blocked by the *Soundproof* ability but is hindered by Grass-type immunity mechanics in specific niche scenarios.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively wide distribution among Grass and Fairy types (54 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic "Clerics" such as **Chansey**, **Blissey**, and **Florges** frequently run this move to keep their defensive cores healthy. It is also a staple on **Vileplume** and **Roserade**.
* **Coverage Utility:** High-tier legendary threats like **Xerneas** and **Calyrex (all forms)** have access to it, allowing them to purge status while setting up for a sweep. **Galarian Weezing** utilizes it to provide unique utility while neutralizing abilities with *Neutralizing Gas*.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via Level Up or as an Egg Move; it has rarely been available as a TM or TR, making it a specialized tool for specific defensive archetypes.
