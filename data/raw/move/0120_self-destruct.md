## Identity & Mechanics
**Self-Destruct** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user triggers a massive internal detonation, releasing all its remaining life energy in a violent, catastrophic explosion. This desperate maneuver targets every other Pokémon on the battlefield with a high-pressure shockwave. Because the move consumes the user's entire essence, the user faints immediately upon execution, regardless of whether the attack successfully connects or is negated by an immunity.
* **Effect:** The user faints instantly. It deals massive physical damage to all adjacent Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is mechanically significant as a "suicide move" to prevent the opponent from using certain moves (like Rapid Spin or Defog) or to provide a "free switch" to a teammate.
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (Hits allies and enemies in Double/Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 200, Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Momentum Pivot.
* **Usage:** Traditionally used as a "Last Resort" when a Pokémon is at low HP to take an opponent down with it. While **Explosion** (250 Power) is statistically superior, Self-Destruct is often preferred or required due to wider availability in certain movepools. Historically (Generations I–IV), this move halved the target's Defense during damage calculation, effectively making it 400 Power; in modern generations, it relies on its raw 200 Power. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is **Resisted** by Rock and Steel, and **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. It is blocked by the ability **Damp**.

* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Electrode**, **Golem**, and **Weezing**, who use it to punish opponents after setting hazards or Screens. **Snorlax** is a notable STAB user, capable of dealing immense damage due to its high Attack stat and STAB bonus.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on heavy-hitters like **Metagross** and **Landorus-Therian** as a way to "delete" a specific threat or to safely bring in a frail sweeper without them taking damage on the switch.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM36** (Gen I) and has appeared as a TM or Move Tutor option in nearly every major title, including Sword/Shield and the Let's Go series.
