## Identity & Mechanics
**Nature's Madness** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** The user taps into the primal, untamed energy of the natural world to strike the opponent with a surge of island magic. This move bypasses traditional damage calculations, channeling the "force of nature" to instantly deplete a massive portion of the target's vitality. It is the signature technique of the Alolan Guardian Deities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts fixed damage equal to exactly **50% of the target's remaining HP**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Progressive Chipper.**
* **Usage:** Nature's Madness functions as the Fairy-type equivalent to *Super Fang*. Its primary value lies in its ability to ignore the target's Defense and Special Defense stats, making it an elite tool for neutralizing "walls" and defensive tanks. Because it deals **fixed percentage damage**, it is one of the few ways for Fairy-type users to severely punish Steel and Poison-type switch-ins that would otherwise resist their STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) attacks. While it cannot KO an opponent on its own, it puts enemies into range for a teammate to clean up.
* **Matchups:** As a Fairy move, it is blocked by targets with type immunity (though no type is naturally immune to Fairy). It is particularly effective against high-HP threats like **Blissey**, **Snorlax**, or **Toxapex**.
* **Attributes:** This move does not make contact. In Generation VII, it serves as the base move for the exclusive Z-Move **Guardian of Alola**, which increases the HP reduction to 75%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, being the signature move of the Alolan Land Spirits (4 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** It is exclusively utilized by the four Alolan Guardians: **Tapu Koko**, **Tapu Lele**, **Tapu Bulu**, and **Tapu Fini**.
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Tapu Fini**, it is a staple of defensive and utility sets to provide consistent damage despite Fini's mediocre offensive presence. On **Tapu Koko**, it is often used to catch Ground or Steel-type switch-ins off guard, softening them up for a Wild Charge or Thunderbolt later.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned strictly through leveling up by the Tapu series of Legendary Pokémon.
