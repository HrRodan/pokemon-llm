## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Sky** is a Status Shadow-type move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically appearing in the spin-off title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user calls upon a dark, oppressive aura that consumes the horizon, blotting out the sun and moon to create a localized atmospheric disturbance. This chaotic weather pattern rains down shadowy energy, creating a desolate environment that hinders all standard Pokémon while empowering those corrupted by darkness.
* **Effect:** Changes the battlefield weather to **Shadow Sky** for five turns. While active, all Pokémon on the field—excluding Shadow Pokémon—take **1/16th of their maximum HP** in chip damage at the end of every turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** Under this weather, the move **Weather Ball** becomes typeless (rather than gaining an elemental type) and its power is doubled.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 5.
* **Role:** **Weather Setter / Environmental Disruptor.**
* **Usage:** Within the context of the Orre Region's Shadow Pokémon mechanics, Shadow Sky functions as a "Shadow" variant of Sandstorm or Hail. It is a **passive damage accelerator** used to wear down an opponent's team. Because Shadow-type moves are "Super Effective" against all non-Shadow Pokémon in *Pokémon XD*, this weather further punishes players who do not use Shadow Pokémon themselves.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal direct damage; however, the weather damage ignores traditional type resistances, affecting all non-Shadow types equally.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; field-wide effect; exclusive to the Shadow Pokémon sub-mechanic.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **narrow distribution**, as it is exclusive to Shadow Pokémon in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Shadow Lugia** (XD001), where it serves as a thematic cornerstone of its corrupted power. It is also found in the movesets of the Shadow versions of the Legendary Birds: **Shadow Articuno**, **Shadow Zapdos**, and **Shadow Moltres**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Since "Shadow" is a temporary state for a Pokémon, this move is never used for coverage on standard competitive teams; it is strictly a boss-mechanic or mid-game obstacle for players to overcome.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is hard-coded into the movesets of specific Shadow Pokémon and is lost permanently once the Pokémon undergoes **Purification**.
