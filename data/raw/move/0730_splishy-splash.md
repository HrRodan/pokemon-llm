## Identity & Mechanics
**Splishy Splash** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation VII, exclusively appearing in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!*.
* **Description:** The user summons and surfs upon a massive, surging oceanic wave infused with crackling electrical energy. This hybrid-style attack crashes down on enemies, combining the crushing force of water with a lingering high-voltage discharge.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent special damage to targets. Despite being a Water-type move, its thematic ties to electricity allow it to disrupt the nervous systems of opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to inflict the **Paralysis** status condition.
* **Targeting:** **All Opponents** (Hits both foes in Double Battles without affecting the user's ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB-Equivalent / Coverage Nuke.
* **Usage:** Splishy Splash serves as a premier coverage option, comparable to a boosted version of *Surf* or *Scald*. While *Scald* is famous for its burn chance, Splishy Splash offers the same base power but provides **Paralysis** support, effectively neutering faster threats. It is specifically designed to bypass the traditional weaknesses of its primary user, hitting Ground-types for massive damage. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Spread Move**, making it highly effective in multi-battle scenarios. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Partner Pikachu** (the starter Pokémon in *Let's Go, Pikachu!*). 
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is the ultimate anti-meta tool for Pikachu; it allows an Electric-type to directly counter and OHKO **Ground-type** threats like Golem, Rhydon, and Nidoking that would otherwise be immune to its primary STAB attacks.
* **Acquisition:** This is a **Move Tutor** exclusive, taught by the Move Tutor in Cerulean City's Pokémon Center within the Kanto region of the *Let's Go* series. It is not available via TM or TR in main-line series games like *Sword/Shield* or *Scarlet/Violet*.
