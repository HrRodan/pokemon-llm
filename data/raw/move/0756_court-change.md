## Identity & Mechanics
**Court Change** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** The user exerts a mysterious, tactical power to manipulate the battlefield's dimensions, physically swapping the active field effects and hazards currently affecting the user's side with those on the opponent's side. It represents a total "flip of the script," turning an opponent's setup against them.
* **Effect:** Swaps all entry hazards (Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Sticky Web) and field conditions (Reflect, Light Screen, Aurora Veil, Tailwind, Safeguard, and G-Max Steelsurge's spikes) between the user's side and the opponent's side.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Entire field (affects both sides simultaneously).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Field Disruptor / Anti-Hazard Utility.**
* **Usage:** Court Change is a high-impact utility move that serves as a unique alternative to Rapid Spin or Defog. Instead of simply removing hazards, it punishes the opponent for setting them. It is particularly devastating against "Hazard Stack" or "Hyper Offense" teams that rely on **Reflect** and **Light Screen**, as the user can steal the defensive buffs while dumping detrimental hazards onto the opponent's side. It does not hit any types for damage, but it effectively "counters" **Rock, Ground, Poison, and Bug** hazard-setting strategies.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect/Detect**; is not blocked by **Substitute**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, as it is the signature move of the Cinderace evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Cinderace**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is exclusive to **Cinderace**, it defines the Pokémon's utility role in competitive tiers like Smogon OU. Cinderace uses its high speed to act as a "clutch" hazard controller, flipping the momentum of the game in a single turn.
* **Acquisition:** Only learned via leveling up by Cinderace (and its pre-evolutions in specific contexts); it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor move for any other species.
