## Identity & Mechanics
**Bite** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user clamps its sharp fangs or teeth onto the target with great force. This vicious physical assault is delivered with such suddenness that it may cause the target to reel back, unable to move. While originally a Normal-type move in its debut, it was reclassified as a Dark-type move in Generation II to better fit its predatory nature.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to make the target **Flinch**, provided the user moves before the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 25 (Max 40).
* **Role:** Reliable Early-game STAB / Flinch-Hax Utility.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Bite is largely outclassed by its direct upgrade, **Crunch** (80 Power), which offers a higher damage ceiling and a Defense-dropping secondary effect. However, Bite remains a staple in lower-level playthroughs and can be niche-viable on Pokémon with the **Strong Jaw** ability (which boosts its power to 90) or **Technician** (boosting it to 90), making it a high-accuracy alternative with a superior flinch rate compared to Crunch. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet. It is also classified as a **Biting** move, benefiting from the Strong Jaw ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution, with **264 Pokémon** able to learn it, typically early in their leveling progression.
* **Prominent Users:** Most frequently associated with predatory or canine-like Pokémon such as **Tyranitar**, **Arcanine**, **Lycanroc**, and **Mabosstiff**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen as early-game coverage for non-Dark types like **Gyarados**, **Charizard**, and **Aerodactyl**, allowing them to hit Psychic and Ghost types before they gain access to more powerful moves.
* **Acquisition:** While predominantly learned via level-up across nearly every biological "biter" in the Pokédex, it has occasionally appeared as a TM or Move Tutor option in various generations.
