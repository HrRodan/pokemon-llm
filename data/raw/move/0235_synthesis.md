## Identity & Mechanics
**Synthesis** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user absorbs ambient light and nutrients to restore its vitality. This move acts as a primary form of semi-reliable recovery, where the effectiveness is dictated by the current atmospheric conditions. It is a thematic cornerstone for many Grass-type Pokémon, emphasizing their biological connection to photosynthesis.
* **Effect:** Restores the user's HP. Under neutral weather conditions, it restores **50%** of the user's maximum HP. 
* **Weather Modifiers:** Healing is boosted to **66.7% (2/3)** during Harsh Sunlight. Conversely, healing is reduced to **25% (1/4)** during Rain, Sandstorm, or Snow/Hail.
* **Targeting:** User (Self-targeting).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Sustain / Reliable Recovery** (Context-dependent).
* **Usage:** Synthesis is the Grass-type equivalent to *Recover* or *Soft-Boiled*, but with a significant drawback: weather dependency. While it is essential for the longevity of defensive Grass-types, it is inherently risky in tiers where Sandstorm (Tyranitar/Gigalith) or Rain (Pelipper/Kyogre) are prevalent, as the reduced healing can turn a "check" into a liability. It is most potent on **Sun Teams** where it outperforms nearly all other recovery moves.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses *Protect* (as it targets the user). It is blocked by *Taunt* and *Heal Block*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Grass-type Pokémon (121 total learners), acting as a signature recovery tool for the type.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a staple for defensive builds of **Venusaur** (especially Mega Venusaur), **Torterra**, and **Meganium**. Mythical and Legendary Pokémon such as **Celebi**, **Shaymin**, and **Tapu Bulu** also utilize it to maintain presence on the field.
* **Coverage Utility:** While almost exclusively learned by Grass-types, it is used by offensive threats like **Kartana** or **Lurantis** to allow for "setup sweeping" opportunities (e.g., pairing Synthesis with Swords Dance). **Brute Bonnet** uses it to leverage its high HP stat under Protosynthesis (Sun) boosts.
* **Acquisition:** Historically a move learned via Level Up or Move Tutor. It is notably absent from the TM/TR lists in many generations, making it a specialized tool for natural Grass-types rather than a universal coverage option.
