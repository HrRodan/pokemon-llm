## Identity & Mechanics
**Metal Burst** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user absorbs the impact of an incoming attack and immediately retaliates by releasing a violent burst of metallic energy or kinetic shockwaves. Unlike standard attacks, it does not rely on the user's Attack stat, but rather the force of the blow received, making it a reactive "damage-reflecting" maneuver.
* **Effect:** Targets the last opposing Pokémon to hit the user with a damaging move during the same turn. It inflicts fixed damage equal to **1.5×** the HP lost from that attack. Unlike *Counter* or *Mirror Coat*, Metal Burst works against both Physical and Special attacks.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the move will fail if the user is faster than the attacker and has not yet taken damage that turn.
* **Targeting:** Responds to the specific move/target that last hit the user.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Retaliatory Punisher / Anti-Offense Utility.
* **Usage:** Metal Burst is a unique alternative to *Counter* and *Mirror Coat*. Its primary distinction is its **0 Priority** bracket; while Counter/Mirror Coat have -5 priority (guaranteeing the user moves last), Metal Burst requires the user to be naturally slower than the opponent to function. It is often paired with the **Sturdy** ability, allowing a Pokémon to survive a lethal "nuke" at 1 HP and return 1.5× that massive damage for a guaranteed KO.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Steel-type move, it hits almost all targets reliably. While type effectiveness (resistances) is ignored for the damage calculation, **Type Immunity** still applies (though currently, no type is naturally immune to Steel).
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move. It does not trigger effects like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (30 learners), primarily concentrated among heavy Steel and Rock types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Aggron** and **Bastiodon**, who frequently utilize the "Sturdy + Metal Burst" strategy. It is also found on powerful Steel-types like **Dialga**, **Bisharp**, and **Kingambit**.
* **Competitive Utility:** **Zamazenta (Crowned Shield)** and **Archaludon** can use their massive natural bulk to stomach hits and retaliate with Metal Burst to surprise opponents who expect a defensive setup. **Sableye** (including its Mega form) is a rare non-Steel user that can utilize it for niche technical play.
* **Acquisition:** It is primarily learned via level-up or Egg Moves; it has not historically been a common TM or TR, making its presence on a team often predictable but difficult to play around without "flipping" the turn order.
