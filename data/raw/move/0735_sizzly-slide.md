## Identity & Mechanics
**Sizzly Slide** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** The user ignites its entire body, cloaking itself in a roaring shroud of intense thermal energy before launching a high-speed, sliding tackle at the opponent. This physical assault utilizes extreme friction and heat to sear the target upon contact, leaving behind a lingering ignition.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage and provides a guaranteed secondary status condition.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility Attacker / Guaranteed Status Support.
* **Usage:** While its base power is relatively low compared to Fire-type nukes like Flare Blitz, its 100% Burn rate makes it one of the most oppressive utility moves in the series. It effectively functions as a guaranteed *Will-O-Wisp* that cannot be blocked by *Taunt* and provides chip damage. It is a hard counter to physical wallbreakers, immediately halving their Attack stat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move; it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 total learner), as it is a specialized "Partner Move."
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Partner Eevee** (the player's starter in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*). 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is locked to the Partner Eevee, it provides essential Fire-type coverage to a Normal-type Pokémon, allowing Eevee to threaten **Steel-types** and **Grass-types** that would otherwise resist or wall its Normal-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or leveling up. It can only be learned via a **Move Tutor** located in the Celadon City Pokémon Center in the *Let's Go* games.
