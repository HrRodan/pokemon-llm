## Identity & Mechanics
**Clanging Scales** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user rhythmically vibrates and rubs its armored scales together, generating a deafening, metallic sonic boom that reverberates across the battlefield. This intense sound-based offensive maneuver creates a crushing wave of acoustic energy to strike multiple foes. While devastating, the friction and force of the vibration leave the user’s protective plating momentarily compromised, making them more vulnerable to physical strikes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts high-power damage to all adjacent opponents. After the attack connects, the user's Defense stat is lowered by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's Defense by one stage.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Damage Spread Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** As a signature move, it serves as a powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) alternative to *Draco Meteor*. Unlike *Draco Meteor*, which sharply lowers Special Attack and forces a switch-out, **Clanging Scales** preserves the user's offensive presence at the cost of physical bulk. In VGC and Double Battles, it is particularly potent as a **Spread Move**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move, allowing it to bypass the move *Substitute* to hit the target directly. It is blocked by Pokémon with the *Soundproof* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), being the signature move of the Jangmo-o evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kommo-o** and its **Totem** variant. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. However, for Kommo-o, it provides a high-accuracy, high-power Dragon STAB that does not penalize its Special Attack stat, making it a staple on Special or Mixed attacker sets.
* **Acquisition:** Learned naturally via level-up by Kommo-o. In Generation VII, it is the base move required for the exclusive Z-Move, **Clangorous Soulblaze**, which deals massive damage and boosts all of the user's stats.
