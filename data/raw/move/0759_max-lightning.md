## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Lightning** is a Physical (or Special) Electric-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** An immense, thunderous strike channeled by a Dynamaxed Pokémon. The user draws concentrated electricity from the surrounding power spots, calling down a colossal pillar of lightning that saturates the battlefield with high-voltage energy. This discharge electrifies the ground, transforming the field into **Electric Terrain** for five turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and sets **Electric Terrain**. Under this terrain, the power of Electric-type moves is increased by 30% (for grounded Pokémon), and all grounded Pokémon are prevented from falling asleep or using Rest.
* **Secondary Effect:** Guaranteed terrain set (100% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Field-Setting Nuke / Terrain Utility.** 
* **Usage:** Max Lightning is a cornerstone of Gen VIII competitive play (VGC and Dynamax formats). Unlike standard moves, its **Power scales based on the base move** used (e.g., Rising Voltage or Thunder results in 140 Power). Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to **override other Terrains** and **self-buff** the user’s subsequent Electric attacks. It is a hard counter to sleep-inducing strategies like Sleep Powder or Spore (common from Amoonguss). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (Never-Miss); ignores protection moves like Protect to deal 25% chip damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Max Move, it is available to **any Pokémon** that has a damaging Electric-type move in its active moveset while Dynamaxed. 
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Zapdos:** One of the most dominant users, often cycling between Max Airstream for Speed and Max Lightning for raw power and terrain control.
    * **Regieleki:** Utilizes its Transistor ability alongside Max Lightning to reach absurd damage thresholds.
    * **Tapu Koko:** While it has the Electric Surge ability, Max Lightning allows it to reset its own terrain if it has been replaced by an opponent's Max Move (like Max Flare or Max Starfall).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently accessed by Physical attackers such as **Zacian-Crowned** (via Wild Charge) or **Cinderace** to provide Electric coverage and terrain support for the team.
* **Acquisition:** Dynamax-exclusive mechanic; not available via TM/TR, but the base moves required to trigger it are widely available.
