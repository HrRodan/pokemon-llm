## Identity & Mechanics
**Healing Wish** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user sacrifices its remaining life force in a mystical display of altruism, causing it to faint instantly. In exchange, the Pokémon sent out to replace the user is bathed in restorative energy, having its HP fully restored and all major status conditions (such as Burn, Paralysis, or Sleep) cured. This move is a high-stakes tactical maneuver used to bring a weakened "win condition" back into the fight at peak performance.
* **Effect:** The user faints immediately. The next Pokémon sent out is fully healed of HP and status. Since Generation VIII, the effect is "queued"; if the immediate replacement is already at full health, the healing effect lingers until a damaged Pokémon is switched in.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is a self-inflicted faint).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user and the subsequent replacement ally.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Sacrificial Pivot / Momentum Support.**
* **Usage:** Healing Wish is primarily used as a "second life" for a team's primary sweeper. It is common on offensive teams where a Pokémon like **Latias** or **Jirachi** has completed its role (setting hazards or softening the enemy) and chooses to faint to safely bring in a crippled teammate. It is often compared to **Lunar Dance** (Cresselia’s signature move), which also restores PP but is much less widely distributed.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses protection if used on oneself, though the healing effect occurs after the user leaves the field. It provides a **safe switch-in**, as the user faints before the opponent moves if the user is faster.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (35 learners), primarily found among Psychic and Fairy-type Pokémon known for their supportive lore.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-tier competitive threats such as **Latias**, **Jirachi**, **Gardevoir**, and **Blissey**. 
* **Tactical Users:** Often seen on **Hatterene** and **Enamorus-Incarnate** to provide team utility once their offensive presence is countered. **Clefable** occasionally runs it to give a teammate a clean entry.
* **Acquisition:** While historically a level-up or Egg move for most of its existence, it became more accessible as a **TM/TR** in recent generations (such as TR85 in Sword/Shield and TM166 in Scarlet/Violet).
