## Identity & Mechanics
**Comet Punch** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rapid-fire flurry of strikes, pummeling the target with a meteor shower of hits. This multi-strike attack is characterized by its speed and repetitive impact, designed to overwhelm the opponent's defenses through sheer volume of blows.
* **Effect:** This is a multi-strike move that hits the target **2 to 5 times** in a single turn. It has a 37.5% chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit 4 or 5 times, averaging 3 hits per use.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though it is uniquely capable of breaking through **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, and **Substitutes** by dealing damage across multiple instances.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 18 (Per hit), Accuracy 85%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Niche Multi-strike Attacker / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Comet Punch is generally considered a high-variance, low-reward move compared to consistent Normal-type STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) options like *Return* or *Body Slam*. While it can theoretically reach a base power of 90 if it hits 5 times, its 85% accuracy and the risk of only hitting twice (36 base power) make it unreliable. It is most notable for its synergy with the ability **Iron Fist**, which boosts the power of punching moves by 20%.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **resisted by Rock and Steel** and has **no effect on Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, making it compatible with the Protector/Punching Gloves items and the Iron Fist ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (9 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with humanoid or pugilistic themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically associated with **Hitmonchan** (who benefits from Iron Fist) and **Kangaskhan** (including its Mega Evolution). It is also a signature-style move for the **Ledian** and **Pangoro** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Buzzwole** or **Timburr** in low-level play, though these Fighting-types almost always prefer their native Fighting-type STAB moves for better damage output.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is **not available as a TM or TR** in any generation, meaning Pokémon must learn it via level-up or breeding.
