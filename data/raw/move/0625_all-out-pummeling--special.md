## Identity & Mechanics
**All-Out Pummeling (Special)** is a Special Fighting-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user conjures a massive amount of Z-Power, channeling its fighting spirit into a relentless, concentrated barrage of energy blasts. This cinematic attack represents the ultimate expression of Fighting-type prowess, overwhelming the target with sheer offensive momentum and spirit-based projectiles.
* **Effect:** This move is a Z-Move that can only be activated if a Pokémon holds **Fightinium Z** and knows a base Special Fighting-type move (such as Focus Blast or Aura Sphere). The power of the move scales based on the power of the original base move.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. Z-Moves generally bypass the secondary effects of their base moves in favor of raw damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single-target Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Scales 100-190], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats to turn the notoriously unreliable *Focus Blast* (70% accuracy) into a guaranteed-hit, massive damage nuke. It is a premier tool for Special Sweepers to bypass traditional defensive checks or "punch a hole" through a team. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics apply: it bypasses accuracy checks and can hit through *Protect* or *Detect* (dealing 25% of the original damage).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution, as any Pokémon capable of learning a Special Fighting-type move can utilize it provided they hold the corresponding Z-Crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Lucario** (Aura Sphere/Focus Blast) and **Keldeo** (Secret Sword/Focus Blast) to secure KOs that their standard moves might miss. It is also a staple for **Mewtwo** in Ubers to deal massive damage to Dark-type switch-ins.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Special attackers like **Alakazam**, **Gengar**, or **Thundurus-Therian** using *Focus Blast* as a base move to lure and eliminate Steel-type walls like Ferrothorn or Heatran.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the user to hold **Fightinium Z**, which is obtained after completing the Fighting-type Trial (or equivalent event) in the Alola region.
