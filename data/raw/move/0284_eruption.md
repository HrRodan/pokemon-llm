## Identity & Mechanics
**Eruption** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user releases its pent-up anger and internal thermal energy in a catastrophic volcanic explosion. Molten magma and intense heat waves radiate from the user, scorching the entire battlefield. This move's potency is directly tied to the user's physical well-being; the more vitality (HP) the user has, the more explosive and devastating the resulting blast.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the user's current HP. The power is calculated using the formula: `150 * (Current HP / Max HP)`. At full health, it reaches a massive 150 Base Power, but the strength diminishes rapidly as the user takes damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All opponents (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150 (Max), Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Spread Attacker.
* **Usage:** Eruption is a premier "Wallbreaker" and "Cleaner" move, especially in VGC (Doubles). Because its power scales with HP, it is almost exclusively paired with **Choice Scarf** to ensure the user moves first before taking damage, or utilized within **Trick Room** by slower threats. It is significantly more powerful than *Fire Blast* or *Flamethrower* at high health but becomes useless if the user is at low HP (often requiring *Flash Fire* or *Regenerator* support). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Spread Move**, meaning it hits both opponents in Doubles, though its damage is reduced by 25% when targeting multiple foes. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very **Narrow** distribution (10 total learners), typically reserved for Pokémon with volcanic or primeval themes.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Typhlosion (and Hisuian Form):** The most iconic user, often utilizing a Choice Scarf to fire off full-power STAB Eruptions.
    * **Torkoal:** A staple in Trick Room teams; its low Speed and *Drought* ability make its Eruption hit incredibly hard under the Sun.
    * **Groudon (Primal Groudon):** Uses its massive Special Attack and *Desolate Land* weather to turn Eruption into a format-defining nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is rarely seen as coverage; it is almost always used as a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option by the few Pokémon that learn it.
* **Acquisition:** Highly exclusive; it is **not available via TM or TR** in any generation, requiring leveling up or specific Move Tutor/Event access.
