## Identity & Mechanics
**Encore** is a status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user applauds the target's last action, compelled by the performance, the target is forced to repeat its previous move for several turns. This psychological pressure creates a tactical loop, preventing the opponent from adapting to the changing state of the battlefield. It is a premier "lockdown" tool used to capitalize on an opponent's passivity or predictable setup.
* **Effect:** The target is forced to repeat its last used move for a duration of 3 turns (historically 4–8 turns in older generations). The move fails if the target has not yet moved, if its last move was Encore, or if the last move has 0 PP. If the forced move is disabled or prevented, the target will use Struggle.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Utility / Lockdown / Setup Punisher.
* **Usage:** Encore is one of the most dangerous utility moves in the competitive circuit. It is primarily used to trap opponents into "detrimental" moves such as **Recover**, **Stealth Rock**, or **Dragon Dance**. Once a foe is Encored into a non-attacking move, the user can safely switch to a counter or use the free turns to set up their own boosts. It effectively forces a switch, granting the Encore user "momentum."
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Substitute** (since Gen VI), making it an excellent check to "Sub-Seed" or "Sub-Setup" strategies. It is particularly oppressive when paired with the **Prankster** ability, allowing for priority lockdown.

* **Utility Coverage:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Alakazam**, **Infernape**, and **Hawlucha**. These fast attackers use Encore to create "setup windows" against defensive walls like Toxapex or Blissey.
