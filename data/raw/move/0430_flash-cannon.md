## Identity & Mechanics
**Flash Cannon** is a Special Steel-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal light energy into a concentrated, high-intensity beam of metallic radiance, releasing it all at once in a blinding burst. This sudden flash of steel-energy is designed to pierce through defenses, often leaving the opponent's sensory systems and magical barriers compromised.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10% chance** to lower the target’s **Special Defense** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / **Consistency Option**.
* **Usage:** Flash Cannon is the gold-standard Special Steel-type move for most competitive attackers. While it lacks the raw explosive power of *Steel Beam* (140 BP) or Gholdengo’s *Make It Rain* (120 BP), its perfect accuracy and lack of drawbacks make it the preferred choice for sustained pressure. It is primarily used to punish **Fairy**, **Ice**, and **Rock** types, which are hit for **Super Effective** damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, beam-based move. It is particularly valuable in modern metas as a primary tool for checking powerful Fairy-type threats.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (176 learners), making it accessible to a vast array of Pokémon that can manifest light or metallic energy.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Magnezone**, **Aegislash**, **Gholdengo**, and the legendary **Dialga**. Special-attacking **Lucario** also relies on it as a primary offensive tool.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Steel Special attackers such as **Hydreigon**, **Goodra-Hisui**, and **Blastoise** to provide vital coverage against Fairy-type switch-ins that would otherwise wall them.
* **Acquisition:** Flash Cannon is highly accessible, appearing as a **TM** (TM91 in many generations) or **TR** across nearly every game since its debut in Diamond & Pearl.
