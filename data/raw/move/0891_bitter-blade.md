## Identity & Mechanics
**Bitter Blade** is a physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user channels intense, bitter resentment toward the living world, manifesting this malice as a blazing, spectral blade. It executes a powerful slashing strike that ignites the target with ghostly flames, absorbing their life force to mend the user's own wounds. This move is characterized by its unique blend of Fire-type elemental power and spiritual energy drain.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and restores the user's HP by 50% of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The healing is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Sustained Physical STAB / Survival Tool.
* **Usage:** Bitter Blade is an elite signature move that provides remarkable longevity. Unlike **Flare Blitz**, which forces the user to take recoil damage, Bitter Blade rewards the user with health, making it the premier choice for bulky physical attackers. It functions as a Fire-type version of *Drain Punch* or *Horn Leech* but with a significantly higher base power of 90. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is categorized as a **Slicing** move, meaning its power is increased by 50% (to 135 Base Power) when used by a Pokémon with the **Sharpness** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Ceruledge**, the Fire/Ghost-type Fire Blades Pokémon. On Ceruledge, this move is often paired with the *Weakness Policy* item or the *Bulk Up* move to maximize damage output and, consequently, the amount of health recovered.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can learn this move via TM, TR, or Breeding. It defines Ceruledge's identity as a "Drain-Sweeper" in the competitive meta.
* **Acquisition:** Learned by Ceruledge upon evolution or via leveling up in the Paldea region; it is not available as a TM.
