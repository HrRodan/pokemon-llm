## Identity & Mechanics
**Bolt Beak** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user focuses an intense surge of high-voltage electricity into its beak before lunging at the opponent with a devastating piercing strike. This move is designed to punish slower targets; by discharging the electricity at the moment of impact before the foe can react, the user creates a massive kinetic and electrical explosion.
* **Effect:** If the user moves before the target (including when the opponent switches out), the base power of the move is doubled from 85 to **170**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85 (Effective 170), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Speed-Conditional Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Bolt Beak is one of the most polarizing and powerful moves in competitive history. Its damage potential rivals that of Explosion or Self-Destruct without the drawback of fainting, provided the user is faster. It is almost always paired with speed-boosting items (Choice Scarf) or weather-based speed abilities (Sand Rush/Slush Rush) to ensure the double-damage condition is met. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Strength Sap.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (2 learners), serving as a signature mechanic for the Galar fossil restorations.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Dracozolt:** The most dangerous user of this move. When combined with the *Hustle* ability, Bolt Beak reaches astronomical damage levels, capable of OHKOing even resistant targets.
    * **Arctozolt:** Utilizes Bolt Beak as a primary STAB option, typically under Snow/Hail conditions where its *Slush Rush* ability allows it to outspeed the majority of the metagame.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its hyper-specific distribution, it is not seen as a coverage move on other Pokémon. It defines the niche of the Pokémon that possess it.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is exclusively learned by the specific fossil Pokémon via level-up.
