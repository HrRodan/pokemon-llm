## Identity & Mechanics
**Leafage** is a physical Grass-type move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user attacks by pelting the target with a flurry of sharp, energized leaves. As a fundamental Grass-type technique, it represents the most basic application of botanical kinetic energy, often serving as the primary physical offensive tool for young Grass-type Pokémon during their early growth stages.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 40.
* **Role:** **Early-game STAB** / **Progression Tool**.
* **Usage:** In a competitive context, Leafage is strictly a "filler" move for low-level encounters. It is almost universally outclassed by **Leaf Blade** (for higher power and critical hit ratio) or **Seed Bomb** (for consistent mid-range damage). Its high PP makes it reliable for the "main story" grind but lacks the utility or raw power required for the VGC or Smogon metagames. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a physical attack that typically does not make contact, as the user launches leaves from a distance.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (29 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon that naturally grow foliage or represent forest-dwelling species.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a signature early-level move for several Grass-type Starters, most notably **Rowlet (Decidueye)**, **Sprigatito (Meowscarada)**, **Treecko (Sceptile)**, and **Turtwig (Torterra)**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Scovillain** as an early physical option, though it is quickly replaced as the Pokémon's movepool expands. It is also found in the base kit of the Island Guardian **Tapu Bulu**.
* **Acquisition:** Leafage is rarely available via **TM or TR**; it is almost exclusively learned via **Level Up** (usually at Level 1 or shortly thereafter), reinforcing its role as a starter-tier move.
