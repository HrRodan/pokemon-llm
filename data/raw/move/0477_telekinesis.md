## Identity & Mechanics
**Telekinesis** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V.
* **Description:** The user exerts intense psychokinetic force to lift the target off the ground, suspending them in a localized gravity-defying field. While suspended, the target's movements become predictable and restricted, making them a "sitting duck" for incoming attacks. This levitation effect grants the target a temporary buoyancy similar to the Levitate ability.
* **Effect:** For three turns (including the turn of use), every move directed at the target (except One-Hit KO moves) will bypass accuracy checks and hit regardless of evasion. However, because the target is floating, they become completely immune to Ground-type attacks, Spikes, and Toxic Spikes.
* **Secondary Effect:** This move will fail if **Gravity** is in effect. If Gravity is used while a Pokémon is under the influence of Telekinesis, the Telekinesis effect is immediately cancelled.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Precision Support.
* **Usage:** Telekinesis is a highly niche technical move primarily used in Double Battles to ensure high-power, low-accuracy moves (like **Zap Cannon**, **Dynamic Punch**, or **Blizzard**) land successfully. It acts as a single-target alternative to Gravity, though it carries the significant drawback of granting the opponent a "free" Ground immunity. It is rarely seen in singles because it consumes a turn that could be used for direct damage or more reliable setup.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; grants Ground-type immunity to the target.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (202 learners), predominantly found among Psychic, Ghost, and Fairy types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Alakazam**, **Mewtwo**, **Gengar**, and **Gardevoir**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on mechanical or supernatural non-Psychic Pokémon like **Metagross**, **Golurk**, and **Klinklang** to facilitate team-based strategies. The **Tapu** guardians (**Tapu Lele, Tapu Koko**, etc.) also have access to this move.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM19** in Generation V (Black/White and Black 2/White 2) but has become much more restricted in later generations, often limited to Move Tutors or specific level-up pools.
