## Identity & Mechanics
**Crabhammer** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user swings a large, heavy pincer or claw with immense force to hammer the target. This specialized aquatic strike is delivered with such momentum that it frequently finds gaps in the opponent's defenses, resulting in devastating critical hits. 
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move has an increased critical hit ratio (+1 stage), making it significantly more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages and Reflect/Screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure damage with high critical hit probability).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Physical Wallbreaker / High-Damage STAB.
* **Usage:** Crabhammer is the premier physical Water-type move for Pokémon with the anatomy to use it. While *Waterfall* is more accurate (100%) and offers a flinch chance, Crabhammer’s significantly higher base power (100 vs 80) and critical hit potential make it the preferred choice for offensive "nukes." It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow and thematic distribution (10 total learners), almost exclusively limited to crustacean-like Pokémon or those with large claws.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Kingler** (who boasts a massive Attack stat to complement it) and **Crawdaunt**, who uses its *Adaptability* ability to turn Crabhammer into a terrifying STAB nuke. It is also used by the Paldean Pokémon **Klawf**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Gliscor** as a niche coverage option to surprise Fire or Ground-type switch-ins, though Gliscor typically prefers utility or Ground-type STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability; it is almost never available via **TM or TR**, usually requiring the Pokémon to learn it via leveling up or as an Egg Move.
