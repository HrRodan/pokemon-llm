## Identity & Mechanics
**Pain Split** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user creates a psychic or spiritual link with the target, tethering their life forces together to equalize their vitality. This spectral connection draws health from the more resilient participant and distributes it to the weakened one until both possess an identical amount of remaining HP. It is often visualized as a dark or ghostly aura flowing between the two Pokémon.
* **Effect:** The user’s and the target’s current HP values are added together and then divided equally between them (rounding down). This move ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers, making it a "sure-hit" status move. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it is important to note that this move does not technically "inflict damage," meaning it does not trigger effects like Counter, Mirror Coat, or Focus Sash, and it bypasses Type-based immunities (it can affect Ghost-types).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reactive Recovery / Chip Damage / Stallbreaking.
* **Usage:** Pain Split is a unique form of recovery used primarily by Pokémon that lack access to reliable healing moves like Recover or Roost. It is most effective on Pokémon with **low Base HP stats** (such as Rotom or Dusclops), as they gain more health when equalizing with high-HP opponents like Blissey or Dondozo. It serves a dual purpose: sustaining the user while simultaneously "chipping" the opponent's health, making it an excellent tool for **Wallbreakers** and **Defensive Pivots**. It fails against targets behind a **Substitute**.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; does not make contact; non-damaging (ignores type-effectiveness).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (185 learners), primarily found among Ghost, Psychic, and Poison types.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly synonymous with **Gengar**, **Rotom (all forms)**, and **Mimikyu**, who use it to maintain longevity despite their lower HP pools. It is also a staple on **Flutter Mane** in modern competitive formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally utilized by defensive threats like **Toxapex**, **Cofagrigus**, and **Sableye** to punish high-HP switch-ins. It is also seen on **Galarian Moltres** as a way to manipulate its *Berserk* ability by fluctuating its HP levels.
* **Acquisition:** Widely accessible via **TM/TR** in various generations, most recently appearing as a TM in *Pokémon Scarlet & Violet*.
