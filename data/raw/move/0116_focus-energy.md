## Identity & Mechanics
**Focus Energy** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user takes a deep breath and sharpens its mental focus, centering its spirit to pinpoint the opponent's vital weaknesses. This state of heightened concentration allows the Pokémon to strike with surgical precision, significantly increasing the likelihood of landing devastating critical hits in subsequent turns.
* **Effect:** The user's critical hit ratio is increased by two stages. This effect persists until the user leaves the field or is successfully transferred to a teammate via **Baton Pass**. The move will fail if the user is already under the effects of Focus Energy.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Self-buff).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 30.
* **Role:** Offensive Setup / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While often overlooked in favor of raw power boosts like Swords Dance or Nasty Plot, Focus Energy serves a niche role as a **Wallbreaker** tool. Critical hits bypass the opponent's defensive stat stages (e.g., Iron Defense) and ignore the damage reduction from Reflect, Light Screen, and Aurora Veil. It is most effectively paired with a **Scope Lens** to reach a Stage 3 critical hit rate, ensuring a **100% critical hit chance** on every attack. It deals **Super Effective** damage indirectly by enabling the user's coverage moves to ignore defensive checks.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; Effect is passed by Baton Pass; Blocked by Taunt.
