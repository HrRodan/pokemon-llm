## Identity & Mechanics
**High Horsepower** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VII.
* **Description:** The user lunges at the target with immense momentum, utilizing its entire body weight to deliver a crushing blow. This move is characterized by a powerful, stampeding physical force, making it a thematic staple for heavy, quadrupedal, or equine-like Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon). Unlike Earthquake, it does not hit adjacent allies in Double Battles.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Earthquake Alternative.
* **Usage:** While slightly less powerful and accurate than the iconic *Earthquake*, High Horsepower is the preferred Ground-type coverage in **VGC (Doubles)** because it avoids hitting allies and its damage is **not halved by Grassy Terrain**. It serves as a vital tool for physical attackers who need to bypass the drawbacks of spread moves. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a contact move (triggers Iron Barbs, Rocky Helmet, etc.).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution, appearing in the movepools of 126 different Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a signature-style move for **Mudsdale** and **Glastrier** (including Calyrex-Ice). It is also a primary STAB option for the heavy-hitting **Ursaluna** and **Mamoswine**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ground Pokémon like **Rillaboom** (to threaten Incineroar and Steel-types), **Melmetal**, and **Tauros (Paldean Forms)** to provide essential physical coverage against Poison and Steel-type checks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it easily accessible for competitive team building.
