## Identity & Mechanics
**Giga Impact** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user pours every ounce of its physical strength into a singular, devastating collision against the target. The sheer momentum and force of the impact are so great that the user is left completely exhausted, requiring a turn to recover its stamina. This move is the physical counterpart to the Special-type move *Hyper Beam*.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. If the move hits, the user must "recharge" on the following turn, during which it cannot attack, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While boasting one of the highest base power stats in the game, Giga Impact is rarely used in standard competitive play because the "recharge" turn allows opponents to freely switch, set up (Dragon Dance/Quiver Dance), or KO the user. It is most viable on Pokémon with the **Truant** ability (like Slaking), as they would waste a turn anyway, or as a base for a powerful **Z-Move** or **Max Strike** (Dynamax), which bypasses the recharge penalty. It deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (**758** learners), as it is a staple "Power TM" available in almost every generation.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic physical powerhouses such as **Snorlax**, **Slaking**, **Regigigas**, and the Alpha Pokémon **Arceus** utilize this move for maximum STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on high-attack non-Normal types like **Dragonite**, **Salamence**, and **Gyarados** as a desperate "all-or-nothing" finishing move or to provide a high-power neutral hit against opponents that don't resist Normal.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common; it has been available as **TM68** or **TR09** across the Sinnoh, Unova, Kalos, Alola, Galar, and Paldea regions.
