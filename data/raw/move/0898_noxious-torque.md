## Identity & Mechanics
**Noxious Torque** is a Physical Poison-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user revs its engine to its limit, releasing a concentrated burst of toxic exhaust and mechanical force against the target. As one of the signature "Torque" moves used by the Team Star Starmobiles, it represents a fusion of automotive engineering and biological toxicity, saturating the battlefield with debilitating fumes.
* **Effect:** Deals consistent physical damage with no negative recoil or stat drops.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30%** chance to inflict the **Poison** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **100**, Accuracy **100%**, PP **10** (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Premium Physical STAB** / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** In terms of raw efficiency, Noxious Torque is the "Gold Standard" for Physical Poison moves. It surpasses **Poison Jab** (80 Power) in strength while offering perfect reliability compared to the shaky accuracy of **Gunk Shot** (80% Accuracy). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy** and **Grass** types, making it a premier tool for dismantling defensive Fairy-type walls.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a "Torque" move, which are exclusive high-performance maneuvers designed for engine-based combat. It does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Unique** distribution (effectively **0** learners in the standard player-accessible Pokédex).
* **Prominent Users:** This move is the signature capability of the **Navi Starmobile (Revavroom)**, piloted by Atticus of Team Star's Poison crew. It is hard-coded for this boss encounter to provide a high-difficulty challenge.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is technically restricted to boss-specific assets, it is not seen in standard VGC or Smogon formats. However, if it were widely distributed, it would be the definitive coverage choice for Physical attackers like **Iron Valiant** or **Zacian-Crowned** to delete opposing Fairy-types.
* **Acquisition:** **Unobtainable** via TM, TR, or Breeding. It exists exclusively within the Movepool of the Team Star Boss Revavroom variants in the Paldea region.
