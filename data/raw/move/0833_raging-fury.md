## Identity & Mechanics
**Raging Fury** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation VIII, specifically debuting in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*.
* **Description:** The user enters a state of primal ferocity, exhaling a relentless torrent of scorched earth and vicious, uncontrollable flames. This berserk assault creates an intense firestorm that consumes everything in its path, but the sheer intensity of the rage causes the user to become mentally fixated on the attack, losing its ability to follow other commands until the rampage concludes.
* **Effect:** The user attacks for 2–3 turns. During this time, the trainer cannot select a different move or switch the Pokémon out. After the final turn of the rampage, the user becomes **Confused** due to fatigue.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to inflict the **Confusion** status condition on the user after the move's duration ends.
* **Targeting:** Random Opponent (in multi-battle formats).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Raging Fury serves as the Fire-type equivalent to *Outrage* or *Thrash*. It provides a massive, recoil-free alternative to *Flare Blitz*, allowing the user to preserve its HP while dealing heavy damage. However, the "lock-in" mechanic makes the user vulnerable to being "checked" by Flash Fire ability users or resistant types (like Water or Dragon) that can switch in safely. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Very Narrow** distribution (4 total learners), making it a rare and specialized tool.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily associated with **Hisuian Arcanine**, who uses it as a signature STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option to punch through defensive cores. It is also a core part of the kit for the Paradox Pokémon **Gouging Fire**, and can be learned by **Infernape**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its restrictive locking mechanic, it is rarely used for coverage; it is almost exclusively utilized by Fire-types who benefit from the high base power to break through Neutral targets.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited availability. It is **not available as a TM or TR** and can only be learned through leveling up by a select few species.
