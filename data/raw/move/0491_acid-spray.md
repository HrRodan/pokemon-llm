## Identity & Mechanics
**Acid Spray** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user ejects a concentrated stream of highly corrosive, acidic fluid that melts and dissolves the target's protective exterior. This chemical onslaught is designed not just for immediate damage but to structurally weaken the opponent's resistance to mystical and elemental energy.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and guaranteed to lower the target's Special Defense stat by two stages (-2 stages).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the Special Defense drop, making it a guaranteed debuff upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Offensive Utility** / **Wallbreaker Setup**. 
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Acid Spray is a potent tactical tool used to force switches or soften up "Special Walls" like Blissey or Clodsire. Because it is an attacking move, it bypasses *Taunt*, allowing defensive Pokémon to continue debuffing the opponent. It is exceptionally popular in **Tera Raids**, where lowering the boss's Special Defense is vital for a team of special attackers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, projectile-based attack. It is effectively the Special-category counterpart to moves like *Screech*, but with the added benefit of breaking *Focus Sashes* and Dealing chip damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (95 learners), primarily found among Poison-types and Pokémon with "fluid-based" themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely utilized by **Toxtricity**, **Toxapex**, and **Glimmora**. It is a staple on **Iron Moth** and **Pecharunt** to facilitate sweeps.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Poison Pokémon like **Bellibolt** (to maximize damage from *Parabolic Charge*) and **Goodra** (both forms) to punish opponents attempting to wall its diverse special movepool.
* **Acquisition:** It has become more accessible in recent generations, appearing as **TM13** in *Scarlet and Violet*.
