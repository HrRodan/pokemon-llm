## Identity & Mechanics
**Breakneck Blitz (Special)** is a Special Normal-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user gathers an immense amount of Z-Power, channeling its momentum and internal energy to charge at or blast the target with overwhelming force. This move manifests as a concentrated explosion of raw, neutral energy, representing the ultimate expression of the Normal type's versatility.
* **Effect:** This is a upgraded version of a base Special Normal-type move, accessible only when a Pokémon holds **Normalium Z**. It bypasses the standard accuracy check to become a **sure-hit move** and ignores effects like King's Rock or Choice Specs, functioning as a one-time tactical strike.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The move's power is its primary utility).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **One-Time Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Breakneck Blitz is utilized to secure KOs that standard moves cannot reach. It is frequently paired with high-power base moves like **Hyper Beam** (which creates a 200 BP nuke) or **Tri Attack** to eliminate a threat without the drawback of a recharge turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **nothing** (Normal-type), but acts as a powerful neutral "check" against most types except Rock, Steel, and Ghost.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; deals 25% chip damage even through **Protect** or **Detect**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon capable of learning a Special Normal-type move and holding the appropriate Z-Crystal.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Porygon-Z:** The premier user of this move; when boosted by the **Adaptability** ability, a Hyper Beam-based Breakneck Blitz becomes one of the hardest-hitting special attacks in the game.
    * **Silvally:** Often uses this in its base Normal form to punch through neutral targets.
    * **Drampa:** Uses its high Special Attack and access to Hyper Voice to create a massive area-of-effect threat or a single-target nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Meloetta** or **Exploud** to bypass their standard move limitations for a single turn.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Normalium Z** crystal; the mechanic was retired in subsequent generations in favor of Dynamax/Terastallization.
