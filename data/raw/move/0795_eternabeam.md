## Identity & Mechanics
**Eternabeam** is a Special Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** As the signature ultimate attack of the legendary Pokémon Eternatus, the user concentrates its massive core energy to unleash a catastrophic beam of cosmic power. This devastating blast represents Eternatus's full strength in its original form, often associated with the energy of the Darkest Day. The sheer output of energy is so great that it temporarily exhausts the user's power reserves.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. The user must spend the following turn "recharging," during which it cannot attack, use items, or switch out.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to force a recharge turn upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 160, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Eternabeam serves as a Dragon-type equivalent to *Hyper Beam* or *Giga Impact*, but with significantly higher base power. In competitive play, it is generally considered a "niche" or "finisher" move. While its 160 Base Power (boosted by STAB to 240) can vaporize many threats, the recharge turn is a massive liability, allowing opponents to switch in a counter or setup for free. It is typically passed over in favor of **Dynamax Cannon** (for consistency) or **Draco Meteor** (for hit-and-run power). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not affected by Mirror Coat if used by a Pokémon with the Bulletproof ability (though no Bulletproof Pokémon currently resists Dragon).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 total learners), functioning as a unique signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Eternatus** and its boss-only form, **Eternamax Eternatus**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. Within Eternatus's own kit, it is used specifically to breakthrough extremely bulky targets that *Dynamax Cannon* cannot OHKO.
* **Acquisition:** This move is learned via leveling up; it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other species.
