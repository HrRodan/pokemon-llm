## Identity & Mechanics
**Poison Powder** is a **Status Poison-type** move introduced in **Generation I**.
* **Description:** The user scatters a thick, toxic cloud of irritating spores or pollen from its body, wings, or flower petals. This hazardous dust hangs in the air and is inhaled by or absorbed through the skin of the target, inducing a debilitating poisoned state. As a "powder-based" move, it carries specific interaction mechanics common to botanical techniques.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Poison** status condition on the target. This causes the victim to lose 1/8th (12.5%) of its maximum HP at the end of every turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The status infliction is the primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy **75%**, PP 35 (Max 56).
* **Role:** Damage-over-time (DoT) Utility / Early-game Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** Poison Powder is generally considered a niche or "budget" status move. In competitive play, it is almost strictly outclassed by **Toxic**, which has better accuracy (90% or guaranteed on Poison-types) and inflicts "Bad Poison" (scaling damage). It is also frequently passed over for **Sleep Powder** or **Stun Spore**, which provide more immediate "hard" crowd control. It is most effective in lower-tier formats or early-game playthroughs where Toxic is unavailable.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Poison-type status move, it has **no effect** on **Steel-type** or **Poison-type** Pokémon. 
* **Attributes:** This is a **Powder-based move**. Since Generation VI, **Grass-type Pokémon**, Pokémon with the **Overcoat** ability, and Pokémon holding the **Safety Goggles** item are completely immune to this move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (**45 learners**), primarily concentrated among Grass-type and Bug-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Bulbasaur line**, **Butterfree**, **Vileplume**, and **Roserade**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Paradox Pokémon like **Slither Wing** or Treasures of Ruin like **Wo-Chien** as part of their natural movepools, though they typically prefer more impactful utility moves.
* **Acquisition:** Unlike many utility moves, Poison Powder is rarely a TM or TR; it is almost exclusively learned through **leveling up**, making it a staple of early-game wild encounters (like Oddish or Bellsprout).
