## Identity & Mechanics
**Rage Fist** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user transforms accumulated resentment and physical pain into a concentrated aura of spectral fury. By channeling the "rage" of being struck in combat, the user delivers a devastating punch that glows with dark, vengeful energy. This move represents the ultimate retaliatory strike, where the user's fighting spirit grows more violent the more it is pressured.
* **Effect:** The move begins with a Base Power of 50. Each time the user is hit by an atmospheric attack (Physical or Special), the move's power increases by **50**. This count persists even if the user switches out or is revived from fainting. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though its power can cap at a staggering **350 BP** after 6 hits.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (Variable), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Snowball Nuke / Late-Game Cleaner.**
* **Usage:** Rage Fist is arguably the most dangerous Ghost-type physical move in the game. Unlike *Shadow Claw* (low power) or *Phantom Force* (two-turn vulnerability), Rage Fist rewards bulky "drain-punch" playstyles. It is particularly lethal against **Psychic** and **Ghost** types. Because multi-hit moves (like *Population Bomb* or *Water Shuriken*) trigger the power boost for *each* individual hit, Rage Fist can reach its maximum potential almost instantly against specific opponents.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and a **Punching** move (benefiting from abilities like Iron Fist, though its primary users prioritize other traits).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 learners), as it is the signature mechanic of the Mankey evolutionary line in Paldea.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Annihilape**, who uses its massive HP pool and the *Defiant* ability to soak up hits and return fire with a boosted STAB Rage Fist. **Primeape** can also use it, and it is the requirement for Primeape to evolve into Annihilape (after using it 20 times).
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Ghost/Fighting Pokémon have access to this move, making it a unique identity for the Annihilape line. Its exclusivity makes it a "Check" to defensive walls that rely on chip damage, as hitting Annihilape only makes its Rage Fist stronger.
* **Acquisition:** Level-up only; not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor.
