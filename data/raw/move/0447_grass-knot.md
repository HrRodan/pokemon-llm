## Identity & Mechanics
**Grass Knot** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user weaves a trap of dense vegetation or psychic-infused vines around the target’s feet, causing them to trip and fall. The efficacy of the move is directly proportional to the target's mass; the more massive the opponent, the more devastating the impact as they crash to the ground. This makes it a specialized tool for punishing gargantuan threats.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the target's weight. The power scales across six tiers:
    *   **20 BP:** < 10kg (22 lbs)
    *   **40 BP:** 10kg – 24.9kg
    *   **60 BP:** 25kg – 49.9kg
    *   **80 BP:** 50kg – 99.9kg
    *   **100 BP:** 100kg – 199.9kg
    *   **120 BP:** ≥ 200kg (440.9 lbs)
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Weight-Dependent Nuke / Special Coverage.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Grass Knot serves as a high-precision alternative to *Energy Ball* or *Leaf Storm*. It is particularly prized in "Ubers" and "VGC" formats where many top-tier threats (like Groudon, Kyogre, and Tyranitar) are exceptionally heavy, consistently triggering the maximum **120 Base Power**. However, it is unreliable against lightweight threats like Rotom-Wash. Note: This move fails against Dynamax/Gigantamax targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water**, **Ground**, and **Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses most defensive abilities that trigger on physical touch.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution (411 total learners), making it one of the most accessible coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Sceptile**, **Venusaur**, **Meowscarada**, and **Serperior**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Extremely common as a "tech" choice on non-Grass types to lure and OHKO 4x weak threats like Swampert or Gastrodon. Frequent users include **Greninja** (leveraging Protean), **Infernape** (Mixed Attacker), and Electric-types like **Tapu Koko** or **Raichu** to bypass Ground-type immunities.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible as **TM86** in earlier generations and a common TM/TR in modern titles (Gen VIII-IX).
