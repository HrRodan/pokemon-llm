## Identity & Mechanics
**False Surrender** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user deceptively bows its head in a feigned apology or submission, lowering the target's guard before suddenly stabbing them with sharp, disheveled hair or appendages. This treacherous feint is designed to exploit the opponent's momentary lapse in focus, ensuring the strike connects regardless of visibility or positioning.
* **Effect:** This attack inflicts damage and is mathematically guaranteed to hit, bypassing all accuracy and evasion modifiers.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for additional effects).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy —%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Evasion Utility.
* **Usage:** While its Power (80) is identical to moves like *Crunch* or *Darkest Lariat*, False Surrender distinguishes itself by ignoring accuracy drops and evasion boosts (such as *Minimize* or *Double Team*). In competitive play, its primary drawback is its low PP count (10), making it less sustainable than other Dark-type options in long-stall wars. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Strength Sap*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 total learners), serving as a signature move for a specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Grimmsnarl** and its pre-evolution **Morgrem**. As the signature move of the Impidimp line, it reflects their mischievous and "wicked" nature.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Dark Pokémon have access to this move through TM or TR, keeping its utility strictly limited to the Grimmsnarl line to punish Evasion-stackers or Pokémon using *Sand Attack* / *Smokescreen*. 
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned exclusively through level-up by the Impidimp evolutionary line.
