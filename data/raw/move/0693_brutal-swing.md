## Identity & Mechanics
**Brutal Swing** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user puts its entire weight into a violent, rotating physical attack, swinging its body, limbs, or held objects in a wide arc to strike everything in its immediate vicinity. This move is characterized by high kinetic momentum and raw, unrefined power, making it a chaotic choice for multi-target engagements.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent Pokémon. In Double Battles, this includes the user's ally, requiring careful positioning or specific synergies (like Telepathy or Protect).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance of status or stat changes).
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Spread Damage / Technician-Boosted Coverage.
* **Usage:** In Singles, it is generally outclassed by **Knock Off** (utility) or **Crunch** (higher raw power). However, its 60 Base Power makes it a prime candidate for the **Technician** ability, boosting its power to 90. In VGC/Doubles, it serves as a niche spread move, though the "friendly fire" aspect makes it riskier than moves like Snarl. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (191 learners), as many Pokémon with large bodies or tails can logically perform a swinging motion.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Incineroar**, **Tyranitar**, **Garchomp**, and **Guzzlord** for STAB or wide-reaching physical presence. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Zacian-Crowned**, **Tinkaton**, and **Rillaboom** to provide physical Dark-type coverage against bulky Ghost or Psychic types when more precise moves are unavailable.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible as a **TM** (TM59 in Sun/Moon; TM97 in Sword/Shield), allowing a massive variety of physical attackers to adopt it for their movepools.
