## Identity & Mechanics
**Blast Burn** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a searing explosion of concentrated fire that incinerates the target with overwhelming heat. This massive conflagration represents the pinnacle of Fire-type mastery, but the sheer force of the blast leaves the user physically exhausted and momentarily immobile.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage on a single target. If the move hits, the user must spend the next turn "recharging," during which it cannot attack, use items, or be switched out manually.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 150, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Blast Burn is the Fire-type equivalent of Hyper Beam or Frenzy Plant. In standard competitive play, it is often considered high-risk due to the "recharge" turn, which grants the opponent a free "set-up" opportunity. It is primarily used as a **Last Resort** to secure a knockout on a critical threat when the user is at low HP. However, it gained significant viability in Generation VIII as a base for **Max Flare**, providing a massive 150-power STAB nuke without the recharge penalty. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by Iron Barbs or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow and exclusive distribution (14 total learners), reserved almost entirely for Fire-type Starter Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fire starters such as **Charizard** (including its Mega Evolutions), **Blaziken**, **Infernape**, and **Skeledirge**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** While primarily a STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for starters, it is also learned by **Mew**, though it is rarely chosen over more consistent options like Blue Flare or Fire Blast.
* **Acquisition:** Historically taught only by specialized Move Tutors to fully evolved starters; however, it has recently become available via **TM/TR** in the Scarlet and Violet (Generation IX) expansions.
