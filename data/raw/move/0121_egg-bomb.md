## Identity & Mechanics
**Egg Bomb** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto region).
* **Description:** The user launches large, explosive eggs at the target with concussive force. This projectile-based attack represents a high-impact but imprecise bombardment, utilizing the user's physical strength to propel the "bombs" across the battlefield.
* **Effect:** Inflicts straightforward physical damage to a single target without additional stat-changing or status-inducing effects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 75%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Historically used as a high-power option for physical attackers in early generations, though it is largely overshadowed by more reliable moves like *Return* or *Body Slam* due to its debilitating 75% accuracy. In the modern meta, it is extremely rare, functioning primarily as a niche flavor move. Because it is a Normal-type move, it cannot deal **Super Effective** damage to any type and is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, while **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** Classified as a **Ball/Bomb move**. This means it is nullified by the Ability **Bulletproof** (e.g., Chesnaught) and receives no benefit from contact-based items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, being learned by only 6 Pokémon species throughout the series.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by egg-themed Pokémon, most notably **Exeggutor** (including its **Alolan Form**), **Exeggcute**, and the **Chansey** family (**Chansey** and **Blissey**).
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically, **Mew** can learn this move, though it rarely opts for it over more consistent physical coverage or utility options.
* **Acquisition:** It was available as **TM37** in the Generation I games (Red, Blue, Yellow), making it a legacy move for many Pokémon transferred from those titles, but it has not been a TM/TR in recent generations.
