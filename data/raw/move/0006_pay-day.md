## Identity & Mechanics
**Pay Day** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user scatters numerous gold coins at the target to inflict damage. The battlefield is littered with riches that the Trainer retrieves once the encounter concludes, making it a primary tool for "money farming" during the main storyline.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage. Upon the conclusion of the battle, the player receives extra prize money equal to five times the user's level multiplied by the number of times the move was successfully used.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for status or stat changes).
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Economic Utility / Early-game Gimmick.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Pay Day is almost never utilized due to its extremely low Base Power (40). It is severely outclassed by **Fake Out** (for priority and flinching) or **Quick Attack**. Its primary "rival" is **Happy Hour**, another event-only move used to double prize money, though Pay Day remains the only move that generates currency based on frequency of use. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move (in most generations) and is affected by items like the Amulet Coin or Luck Incense, which double the financial payout.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (68 learners), originally serving as the signature move of the Meowth evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Meowth**, **Persian**, and **Perrserker**. It is also a core move for "Starter" variants like **Partner Pikachu** and **Partner Eevee**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Surprisingly learned by high-tier Legendaries and Mythicals such as **Mewtwo**, **Zeraora**, and **Calyrex**, though it serves no tactical purpose for them other than flavor or niche money-grinding.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM16** in Generation I and **TM02** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield). It was also prominently featured as a TM in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Eevee!*.
