## Identity & Mechanics
**Body Slam** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user leaps into the air and drops its entire body weight onto the target with crushing force. This impactful collision not only deals significant physical damage but also has a high probability of leaving the opponent incapacitated. Due to its nature as a full-body strike, it is categorized as a **contact move**.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to inflict the **Paralysis** status condition on the target. In newer generations, this move cannot paralyze Ghost-type Pokémon (due to immunity) or Electric-type Pokémon (due to type-wide status immunity).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** Body Slam is a staple in competitive play, favored for its "fishing" potential—the ability to punish switch-ins with a 30% paralysis rate. While moves like *Return* (Gen 2-7) offered higher raw power, Body Slam is preferred on defensive or utility-oriented Pokémon to provide **Speed Control**. It is particularly devastating when used by Pokémon with the **Serene Grace** ability, which doubles the paralysis chance to a staggering 60%.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **Resisted by** Rock and Steel types. It deals **No Damage** to Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, and Effect Spore.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution, with **671** Pokémon capable of learning it across various generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Snorlax**, which utilizes its massive weight for high-damage STAB; **Miltank**, known for the infamous "Stomp/Body Slam" flinch-para combinations; and **Blissey/Chansey**, which use it to paralyze attackers despite their low Attack stats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on Pokémon like **Jirachi** and **Dudunsparce**, who leverage the move alongside *Serene Grace* to maintain momentum and "Para-flinch" opponents into submission.
* **Acquisition:** Body Slam has a long history of availability, appearing as **TM08** in Generation I, **TR01** in Generation VIII, and **TM066** in Generation IX. It is one of the most accessible physical moves in the franchise.
