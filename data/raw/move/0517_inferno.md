## Identity & Mechanics
**Inferno** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a concentrated, hellish vortex of flame that completely engulfs the target. This intense heat is so overwhelming that it incinerates the target's defenses, ensuring they are left with a severe burn if the attack connects. Its visual and thematic identity revolves around absolute thermal intensity and destructive power.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to inflict the Burn status condition upon hitting.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Burn the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 50%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** Inferno is often compared to **Fire Blast** and **Will-O-Wisp**. While it offers a guaranteed Burn (unlike Fire Blast’s 10% chance) and deals massive damage (unlike Will-O-Wisp), its abysmal 50% accuracy makes it a "coin-flip" move. In competitive play, it is generally considered too unreliable unless paired with accuracy-boosting effects like Gravity, Wide Lens, or the Ability **No Guard** (though very few Pokémon can naturally exploit this combination). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range; does not make contact. Not a pulse, ball, or bomb move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (26 total learners), primarily limited to Fire-type Pokémon known for intense heat or supernatural flames.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard**, **Chandelure**, and **Victini**, who learn it via leveling up. **Chi-Yu** also has access to this move, potentially using its high Special Attack to punish switch-ins if the move hits. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Hisuian Typhlosion** or **Houndoom** as a high-variance option to cripple physical attackers on a predicted switch.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it is notable for being absent from the TM/TR lists in most generations, making it a relatively rare "natural" move for Fire-type specialists.
