## Identity & Mechanics
**Mean Look** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user fixes the target with a dark, riveting, and menacing gaze that spiritually binds them to the battlefield. This intense stare psychologicaly prevents the opponent from finding the courage to flee or be switched out by their trainer, effectively immobilizing them in the current engagement. 
* **Effect:** The target is prevented from switching out normally as long as the user remains active on the field. This move bypasses all accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring the trap is successfully set regardless of stat changes. The effect is broken if the user leaves the field, but can be passed to a teammate via **Baton Pass**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% success rate for the trapping effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Perfect), PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Utility / Tactical Trapper.
* **Usage:** Mean Look is the cornerstone of the "Perish Trap" archetype. By pinning a vulnerable opponent to the field, the user can then utilize moves like **Perish Song**, **Toxic**, or **Confuse Ray** to secure a guaranteed knockout while the opponent is unable to switch to a counter. While it faces stiff competition from the Ability **Shadow Tag**, Mean Look allows non-Ghost types to perform similar roles. It is notably countered by pivoting moves like **U-turn**, **Volt Switch**, or **Flip Turn**, and Ghost-type Pokémon are naturally immune to trapping effects as of Generation VI.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Blocked by **Shed Shell**; Transferable via **Baton Pass**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (52 learners), primarily concentrated among Ghost, Dark, and Psychic types.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Umbreon** (for "Mean Look + Baton Pass" strategies) and **Gengar**, who uses it to trap and eliminate defensive walls. It is also a signature utility tool for the **Tapu Guardians** (Tapu Koko, Lele, Bulu, and Fini).
* **Tactical Utility:** Frequently seen on **Sableye** and **Misdreavus** in lower tiers to facilitate stalling. Modern powerhouse **Flutter Mane** also has access to it, allowing it to trap and "nuke" specific threats it outspeeds.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned through Level-Up or Egg Moves; it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its distribution more exclusive to specific tactical archetypes.
