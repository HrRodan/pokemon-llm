## Identity & Mechanics
**Endure** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user braces itself against incoming attacks, focusing its resolve to withstand even the most lethal strikes. This move allows the Pokémon to survive any direct attack or sequence of hits during the turn, ensuring its HP does not drop below 1. It is a vital tool for survival-based strategies and "clutch" plays in high-stakes battles.
* **Effect:** Prevents the user's HP from being lowered below 1 by any attack or effect for the remainder of the turn. This move has a **Priority of +4**, allowing it to execute before almost all offensive moves.
* **Secondary Effect:** Like *Protect*, this move has a **staling mechanic**. If used successfully on the previous turn (including use of Protect, Detect, or the Guard moves), its success rate drops to 50%, continuing to halve with each consecutive use.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Survival Utility / Strategy Enabler.
* **Usage:** Unlike *Protect*, which nullifies damage, *Endure* is specifically used to **trigger low-HP conditions**. It is a cornerstone for "Flail" or "Reversal" sets, where damage is maximized at 1 HP. It is also frequently paired with **Berries** (like the Salac, Liechi, or Custap Berry) or the **Weakness Policy** to safely activate stat boosts. In the current meta, it is often used to waste an opponent's Dynamax or Terastal turns while fishing for a survival-based comeback.
* **Attributes:** Priority Move (+4). It does not protect against status damage (Poison/Burn) or weather damage (Sandstorm/Hail) at the end of the turn, meaning the user may faint immediately after the move's protection ends if a 1 HP survival occurs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Wide** distribution (1,161 learners), making it nearly universal among fully evolved Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Lucario** (to setup a Max-Power Reversal), **Garchomp** (to rack up Rough Skin/Rocky Helmet damage), and **Urshifu** (to survive a faster hit and retaliate).
* **Strategy Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Heracross** to activate Guts or Swarm abilities, and on **Koraidon** or **Miraidon** in Restricted formats to ensure a turn of utility or Berry activation against overwhelming power.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM or TR** across almost every generation it has appeared in, including Gold/Silver, Sword/Shield, and Scarlet/Violet.
