## Identity & Mechanics
**Bug Buzz** is a Special Bug-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user vibrates its wings or chitinous plates at an intense, high-frequency rate to generate a powerful, localized ultrasonic sound wave. This sonic resonance is so forceful that it can disrupt the target's physical composition, vibrating through barriers to strike the opponent directly.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. As a **Sound-based move**, it has the distinct mechanical property of bypassing the move **Substitute**, hitting the target directly behind the decoy.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to lower the target’s Special Defense by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Bug Buzz is the gold-standard Special Bug-type STAB move, occupying a similar niche to *Flamethrower* or *Thunderbolt*. It is almost always preferred over *Signal Beam* (lower power) or *Pollen Puff* (in singles) due to its reliability and ability to ignore Substitutes. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (bypasses Substitute, blocked by the **Soundproof** ability). It is a non-contact move, avoiding effects like *Rocky Helmet* or *Rough Skin*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (77 learners), primarily concentrated among winged insectoid Pokémon and certain sound-themed species.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably utilized by **Volcarona** as its primary STAB move alongside Quiver Dance. Other iconic users include **Yanmega** (which benefits from Tinted Lens to ignore resistances), **Ribombee**, and **Galvantula**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Bug Pokémon such as **Iron Moth** and **Terapagos** to provide specialized coverage against Dark and Psychic-type threats. It is also a staple for **Pheromosa** in mixed-attacker sets.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generations VIII and IX, making it highly accessible for most Special-attacking Bug types.
