## Identity & Mechanics
**Natural Gift** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user harnesses the latent energy within its held Berry to unleash a one-time elemental strike. The user physically manifests the Berry's essence, transforming the move's properties before the item is consumed in the process. This allows for unpredictable, custom-tailored attacks based on the specific Berry equipped.
* **Effect:** The move's **Type** and **Base Power** are determined entirely by the user's held Berry. Upon successful execution, the Berry is consumed. The move fails if the user is not holding a Berry or if the user is under the effect of *Embargo* or *Magic Room*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The primary effect is the consumption of the held item).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable (60–100)], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** One-time Lure / Custom Coverage.
* **Usage:** Historically served as the physical attacker's equivalent to *Hidden Power*. It is used as a "Lure" to surprise and KO a specific counter that would otherwise wall the user. For example, a Grass-type might carry a Fire-type Natural Gift (via Occa Berry) to eliminate an incoming Steel-type. Because it consumes the item, it is a high-commitment, high-reward "Nuke" that requires precise prediction.
* **Type Matchups:** Highly versatile; can deal **Super Effective** damage to any type depending on the Berry selected (e.g., Liechi Berry for Grass-type, Salac Berry for Fighting-type).
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** contact-based, meaning it bypasses effects like *Rough Skin* or *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (506 learners), as it was a ubiquitous TM in Generation IV.
* **Prominent Users:** Widely distributed among iconic Pokémon such as **Charizard**, **Venusaur**, **Garchomp**, and **Lucario**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically utilized by physical flyers like **Talonflame** (using Liechi/Grass to hit Rock/Water types) or **Snorlax** to provide a single instance of heavy elemental damage. It is a staple tech on **Mew** and **Arceus** due to their vast movepools and need for specific lure options.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM83** in Generation IV; however, the move was notably removed from the game in Generation VIII, making it a legacy mechanic in modern competitive formats.
