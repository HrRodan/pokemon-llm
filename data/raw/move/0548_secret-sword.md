## Identity & Mechanics
**Secret Sword** is a Special Fighting-type move introduced in Generation V (Pokémon Black & White).
* **Description:** The user focuses its inner resolve, manifesting a blade of pure energy from its horn to slash the opponent. While it is categorized as a Special move, the "odd power" within the blade strikes with physical force, shearing through traditional magical defenses. This move is the signature technique of Keldeo and is intrinsically tied to its lore as the fourth member of the Swords of Justice.
* **Effect:** Secret Sword deals damage using the user's Special Attack stat, but it calculates damage against the target's **Defense** stat rather than its Special Defense.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Special Wallbreaker / Anti-Special Tank STAB.
* **Usage:** Secret Sword is a premier Fighting-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move that allows a Special Attacker to bypass "Special Walls." Unlike **Focus Blast**, which is notoriously unreliable due to its 70% accuracy, Secret Sword provides perfect consistency. It is most comparable to **Psyshock**, as both moves allow special sweepers to punish Pokémon like **Blissey, Chansey, and Assault Vest users** who typically have massive Special Defense but lower Physical Defense.
* **Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite the "sword" flavor and visual description of cutting with a horn, this move is **not** a contact move, meaning it does not trigger effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin. In Generation IX, it is classified as a **Slicing** move, benefiting from the *Sharpness* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Secret Sword has an **extremely narrow** distribution, being the signature move of the Mythical Pokémon Keldeo.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Keldeo (Ordinary Form)** and **Keldeo (Resolute Form)**. 
* **Form Logic:** In many games (starting with Pokémon Black 2 & White 2), teaching Keldeo Secret Sword is the specific requirement for it to transform into its **Resolute Form**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Keldeo, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. For Keldeo, it is an essential tool to prevent being "walled" by Special tanks that would otherwise shrug off its Hydro Pumps.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR. It is typically learned via a Move Tutor (often a hidden character representing a mentor among the Swords of Justice) or upon reaching Level 1 in more recent generations.
