## Identity & Mechanics
**Clamp** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user seizes the target within a pressurized grip—typically using a hard shell or powerful pincers—to prevent them from fleeing the battlefield. This crushing force deals immediate physical damage and continues to constrict the opponent over several turns, making it a quintessential "partial-trapping" move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and traps the target for 2–5 turns. While trapped, the target cannot switch out and takes 1/16th of its maximum HP as residual damage at the end of each turn. The trapping effect ends prematurely if the user leaves the field or if the target uses Rapid Spin.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to initiate the trapping and residual damage effect upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35, Accuracy 85%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Partial-Trapping Utility / Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** While its base power is low, Clamp is used primarily for its utility in "Trap and Stall" strategies. It is the Physical counterpart to **Whirlpool**. In competitive play, it is often outclassed by more reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves like *Waterfall* or *Liquidation* due to its shaky 85% accuracy. However, it can be used to pin a passive wall or a weakened threat to the field to ensure a KO or to stack chip damage alongside entry hazards. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, limited to only 5 specific evolutionary lines (Total 5 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Cloyster** and **Shellder**, who utilize their bivalve anatomy to execute the move. It is also the signature thematic move for **Clamperl**.
* **Coverage Utility:** In later generations, the move was expanded to the **Binacle** and **Barbaracle** line. Because of its extremely limited distribution, it is almost never seen as a coverage option on non-Water types. 
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via **TM or TR**; it is learned exclusively through level-up by a small group of shell-bearing aquatic Pokémon.
