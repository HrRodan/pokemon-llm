## Identity & Mechanics
**Toxic Spikes** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user litters the opposing side of the field with sharp, venom-coated barbs. This creates a biological entry hazard that infects grounded Pokémon upon switching in. The toxic carpet lingers throughout the battle, punishing frequent switching and providing a method of passive attrition that erodes the health of the opposing team over time.
* **Effect:** Sets an entry hazard on the opponent's side of the field. One layer causes the **Poison** status to grounded opponents upon switching in. A second layer upgrades this effect to **Badly Poisoned** (Toxic damage). 
* **Secondary Effect:** If a grounded Poison-type Pokémon switches in, it automatically removes (absorbs) the Toxic Spikes from its side of the field.
* **Targeting:** Opponent's Field (Hazard).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Entry Hazard / Passive Damage / Stall Support.
* **Usage:** While less universal than Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes is a cornerstone of **Hazard Stacking** cores. It is particularly effective against bulky, grounded teams that lack a Poison-type to absorb them. It is frequently compared to **Spikes**; while Spikes deals immediate chip damage, Toxic Spikes creates a ticking clock that forces the opponent to use **Defog** or **Rapid Spin** to prevent their sweepers from being crippled. It deals **Super Effective** utility against **Fairy** and **Grass** types (who are often grounded and susceptible), though its primary purpose is neutral status attrition.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; cleared by **Rapid Spin**, **Defog**, **Mortal Spin**, or a grounded **Poison-type** switch-in. Ineffective against Flying-types, Steel-types, or Pokémon with the Levitate ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (91 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized heavily by premier defensive and utility Pokémon such as **Toxapex**, **Clodsire**, and **Glimmora** (who can also set them automatically via its *Toxic Debris* ability).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on offensive pivots like **Greninja** or **Meowscarada** to pressure the opponent during forced switches, and on **Cloyster** to supplement its Shell Smash offensive pressure with utility.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
