## Identity & Mechanics
**Mystical Power** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user harnesses a mysterious, ancient psychic energy to strike the target while simultaneously channeling that power inward to bolster its own capabilities. This move represents the inherent mystical essence of the Lake Guardians, manifesting as a shimmering aura that adapts to the user's innate strengths.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and guarantees a stat boost to the user. If the user’s offensive stats are higher than its defensive stats, its Attack and Special Attack are raised by one stage. If its defensive stats are higher, its Defense and Special Defense are raised by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise offensive or defensive stats based on the user's stat spread.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Snowballing Setup / Offensive Utility.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than standard Psychic-type staples like **Psychic** (90 BP) or **Psyshock** (80 BP), Mystical Power functions similarly to moves like *Fiery Dance* or *Torch Song*. It is designed to reward staying on the field by providing a guaranteed "free" setup boost while maintaining offensive pressure. It is particularly effective for turning a defensive pivot into a threat or allowing a sweeper to outscale the opponent. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact; bypasses certain defensive abilities that trigger on contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, functioning as a signature move for the Lake Guardians (3 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Azelf:** Uses the move primarily to boost its Special Attack, turning it into a snowballing Special Sweeper.
    * **Uxie:** Leverages the move to further bolster its already massive Defense and Special Defense, making it an incredibly difficult wall to break.
    * **Mesprit:** Utilizes the move as a versatile tool to patch up whichever stat is prioritized in its balanced spread.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is never seen as a coverage option on non-Psychic types; it is purely a tool for the Sinnoh/Hisui "Lake Trio."
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a signature level-up move in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, later becoming available via move reminder/level-up for the trio in subsequent Generation IX games.
