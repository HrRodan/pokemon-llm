## Identity & Mechanics
**Double-Kick** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user delivers a rapid-fire sequence of two kicks to the target. This multi-hit physical attack is characterized by its speed and precision, allowing the user to strike through defensive barriers or momentum-stopping items. Visually, it often depicts the Pokémon leaping or spinning to land consecutive blows.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage, striking the target exactly **two times** in a single turn. Each hit has its own independent chance to land a critical hit.
* **Secondary Effect:** None; however, as a multi-hit move, it possesses the unique mechanic of breaking **Substitutes**, **Focus Sashes**, and the **Sturdy** ability with the first hit, allowing the second hit to deal direct damage to the opponent's HP.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30 (60 total), Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Multi-Hit Utility.
* **Usage:** In early-game playthroughs, Double-Kick is a vital tool for overcoming Normal, Rock, and Steel-type hurdles (such as Brock in *Yellow* version). In competitive play, it is generally outclassed by higher-base-power moves like *Close Combat* or *Low Kick*. However, it retains niche value for its ability to bypass **Focus Sash** and **Substitute**, which single-hit nukes cannot do. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**, meaning it is affected by abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet* for each of the two hits.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (81 learners), appearing across various biological archetypes from mammalian to avian Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fighting-types and Starters such as **Blaziken**, **Hitmonlee**, **Cinderace**, and the "Swords of Justice" trio (**Cobalion**, **Terrakion**, **Virizion**). It is also a signature part of the **Nidoking** and **Nidoqueen** level-up movepools.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Jolteon**, **Sawsbuck**, and **Zebstrika** to provide necessary coverage against Steel or Rock-type walls that would otherwise resist their primary STAB.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up; while it is not a staple TM in recent generations, it is a common early-game move for many Physical attackers.
