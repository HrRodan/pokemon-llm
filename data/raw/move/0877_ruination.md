## Identity & Mechanics
**Ruination** is a Special Dark-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user calls upon an ancient, catastrophic power to manifest a ruinous disaster upon the battlefield. This dark energy erodes the life force of the opponent, manifesting as a crushing weight or a calamitous event that instantly withers the target's resolve and vitality. 
* **Effect:** Deals fixed damage equal to **50% of the target's current HP**. This makes it a Dark-type variation of moves like *Super Fang* or *Nature's Madness*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Fixed Damage], Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Progress Maker.**
* **Usage:** Ruination is a premier tool for forcing progress against defensive walls and "stall" archetypes. Because it deals damage based on current HP rather than calculated stats, it ignores the target's Defense or Special Defense boosts, making it an ideal response to Pokémon like **Dondozo**, **Blissey**, or **Corviknight**. Unlike *Super Fang*, Ruination’s Dark typing allows it to hit **Ghost-types**, though it is susceptible to the Dark-type resistances of Fairy or Fighting types (though it still deals the fixed 50% damage if it connects).
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as Special, but it does not use the user's Special Attack stat for damage calculation. It is not a contact move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution (4 total learners), serving as the signature mechanic for the "Treasures of Ruin" quartet.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the legendary Paldean Ruinous quartet: **Ting-Lu**, **Chien-Pao**, **Wo-Chien**, and **Chi-Yu**.
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Ting-Lu**, it provides a consistent way to chip down enemies that would otherwise wall its Ground-type STAB. On **Wo-Chien**, it acts as a primary source of pressure for a more defensive, attrition-based playstyle.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is strictly limited to the level-up movepools of the specific Legendary Pokémon mentioned above.
