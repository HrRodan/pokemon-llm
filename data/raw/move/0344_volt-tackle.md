## Identity & Mechanics
**Volt Tackle** is a Physical Electric-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user electrifies its entire body to an extreme degree, generating a massive high-voltage aura before charging headlong into the opponent with reckless abandon. This "life-risking" maneuver results in a devastating impact that releases a burst of electrical energy, though the sheer force of the collision causes significant kickback to the user.
* **Effect:** Inflicts heavy damage. The user receives recoil damage equal to 1/3 (33%) of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Paralyze** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Signature Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Volt Tackle is the signature move of the Pikachu line and serves as the physical counterpart to moves like Double-Edge or Flare Blitz. It is significantly more powerful than the more common Electric physical move, *Wild Charge* (90 Power). When used by a Pikachu holding a **Light Ball** (which doubles its Attack and Special Attack), Volt Tackle becomes one of the hardest-hitting moves in the game relative to the user's tier, though the recoil often limits Pikachu's longevity. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Static.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (9 learners), functioning as a **Signature Move** for the Pikachu evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Pikachu**, **Pichu**, and various event-exclusive forms like **Pikachu-Partner-Cap**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not used for coverage by non-Electric types. Its utility is restricted to "VoltTurn" or "Wallbreaking" sets on Pikachu-specific teams.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via TM or TR. Historically, it is obtained through **special breeding conditions** (one parent must hold a Light Ball while breeding) or via unique event distributions.
