## Identity & Mechanics
**Supersonic Skystrike (Physical)** is a Physical Flying-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** Powered by Flyinium Z, the user gathers immense Z-Power to soar into the stratosphere before plummeting toward the target at terminal velocity. This move represents the pinnacle of kinetic aerial bombardment, transforming a standard Flying-type attack into a high-speed, unstoppable impact that crushes the opponent with overwhelming force.
* **Effect:** This is a Z-Move that upgrades a base physical Flying-type move. It inflicts massive damage and bypasses accuracy checks (except against semi-invulnerable targets like those using Dig). Its Power is determined by the base move (e.g., a base move of *Brave Bird* results in a 190 BP Supersonic Skystrike).
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it bypasses the negative drawbacks of its base move for one turn (e.g., no recoil from *Brave Bird* and no charge-up turn for *Fly*).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–200], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** One-time Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** In the Generation VII metagame, this move was a premier tool for Physical attackers to blast through defensive checks or "lure" and KO counters. Because it can be used with *Fly*, it allowed Pokémon to turn a multi-turn move into an instantaneous, high-damage strike. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Bug, and Fighting** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is considered a **Contact** move if the base move it is derived from also makes contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution, as any Pokémon capable of learning a physical Flying-type move can utilize it provided they hold a **Flyinium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Landorus-Therian:** Often utilized *Flyinium Z* in combination with *Fly* to provide a massive, unexpected Flying-type nuke to delete Grass-types like Tangrowth or Bulu.
    * **Gyarados:** Frequently used this move via *Bounce* to bypass the two-turn requirement and deliver a STAB-boosted nuke that helped it snowball with *Moxie*.
    * **Salamence:** A common user in both standard play and VGC to pick up crucial KOs on Fighting-type threats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Hawlucha** or **Dragonite** to provide a reliable, high-power STAB option without the heavy recoil of *Brave Bird* or the inaccuracy of *Hurricane*.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible in Generation VII via the **Flyinium Z** crystal; Z-Move mechanics were retired in subsequent generations.
