## Identity & Mechanics
**Malignant Chain** is a Special Poison-type move introduced in Generation IX (The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user manifests and hurls a corrosive, toxic chain that constricts the target, saturating them with a deadly, supernatural venom. This move combines high-output special damage with chemical warfare, designed to overwhelm the target's defenses and infect their bloodstream instantly.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and has a very high probability of leaving the target **Badly Poisoned** (Toxic status).
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to inflict the **Badly Poisoned** status condition.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Signature Nuke / Status Spreader.
* **Usage:** Malignant Chain is a strictly superior version of Sludge Bomb, offering higher base power and a much higher chance to inflict the "Toxic" timer. In competitive play, it is the cornerstone of its user's kit, specifically because it synergizes with abilities that punish poisoned targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types, making it a premier tool for deleting defensive Fairy-type walls.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Bulletproof" (unlike Sludge Bomb), does not make contact, and is not a sound-based move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This is the signature move of the Mythical Pokémon **Pecharunt**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to **Pecharunt**, it defines the Pokémon's niche. When combined with Pecharunt's ability, **Poison Puppeteer**, any target Badly Poisoned by Malignant Chain also becomes **Confused**, creating a devastating dual-status pressure that forces switches or leads to "self-hit" RNG.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible to Pecharunt via leveling up; it is not available as a TM, TR, or Move Tutor option for any other Pokémon.
