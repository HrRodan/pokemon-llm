## Identity & Mechanics
**Flame Burst** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user focuses intense thermal energy into a volatile projectile and launches it at a single opponent. Upon impact, the flame violently detonates, scattering scorching embers and "splash" heat across the immediate vicinity. This explosive properties allow it to affect multiple targets indirectly, making it a thematic choice for pyrotechnic-themed Pokémon.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage to the primary target. If the move connects, all Pokémon adjacent to the target (in Double or Triple battles) take fixed damage equal to 1/16 of their maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The splash damage is a primary mechanic of the move, not a percentage-based secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single target, but produces a splash effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Mid-tier Special STAB / Tactical Chip Damage.
* **Usage:** In Single Battles, Flame Burst is generally outclassed by **Flamethrower** (higher power) or **Lava Plume** (high burn chance). Its true niche exists in **Double Battles**, where the splash damage can be used to break **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, or **Multiscale** on an adjacent opponent without needing to target them directly. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. It is hindered by the ability *Bulletproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (31 learners), primarily concentrated among Fire-type Pokémon discovered in or before Generation VII.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently learned by iconic Fire-type starters and powerhouses such as **Charizard**, **Typhlosion (Cyndaquil line)**, and the Mythical Pokémon **Victini**. It is also a signature-style move for the **Chandelure** and **Magmortar** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally found on non-Fire types for coverage; notably **Manectric (Electrike)** and **Skuntank (Stunky)** can utilize it to surprise Steel-type switch-ins that otherwise resist their primary STAB. 
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via leveling up. Notably, it has **no TM/TR availability** in most generations, making its distribution strictly limited to a Pokémon's natural movepool.
