## Identity & Mechanics
**Moonlight** is a Status Fairy-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user calls upon the celestial power of the moon to restore its vitality. This lunar energy bathes the user in a soft glow, mending wounds and restoring HP based on the prevailing atmospheric conditions. It is a vital recovery tool for defensive Pokémon, though its efficacy is heavily dictated by the weather.
* **Effect:** Restores the user's HP. Under normal weather conditions, it heals **50%** of max HP. During **Harsh Sunlight**, healing increases to **2/3 (66.7%)** of max HP. During **Rain, Sandstorm, or Snow/Hail**, healing is reduced to **1/4 (25%)** of max HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — | Accuracy —% | PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Sustainability / Reliable Recovery** (Context-dependent).
* **Usage:** Moonlight serves as the primary recovery engine for several top-tier defensive threats. While functionally similar to *Recover* or *Soft-Boiled*, it is strictly inferior in competitive play due to its **low PP** and **weather vulnerability**. In tiers where Tyranitar (Sand) or Pelipper (Rain) are prevalent, Moonlight becomes unreliable. However, on **Sun teams** (utilizing Torkoal or Koraidon), it becomes one of the most potent healing moves in the game.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Affected by **Taunt**. Bypasses accuracy checks as it targets the user.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (26 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with lunar, nocturnal, or floral themes.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Umbreon:** The quintessential defensive pivot; uses Moonlight to stall out opponents alongside *Toxic* or *Foul Play*.
    * **Cresselia:** A legendary wall that relies on Moonlight to maintain its massive natural bulk in higher competitive tiers.
    * **Clefable:** Often utilizes Moonlight to supplement its *Magic Guard* or *Unaware* abilities, though it occasionally opts for *Soft-Boiled* where legal.
    * **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon):** A modern top-tier threat that uses Moonlight to stay healthy while breaking through teams with *Blood Moon*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Vileplume** or **Bellossom** in lower tiers to provide longevity for "Sun" archetype teams.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via **Level Up**. It is notably absent from TM/TR lists in most generations, making it a specialized tool for its specific learner pool.
