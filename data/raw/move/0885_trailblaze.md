## Identity & Mechanics
**Trailblaze** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user executes a sudden, predatory ambush, lunging at the target as if leaping from the concealment of thick, tall grass. This aggressive burst of movement is followed by nimble, rhythmic footwork that allows the user to maintain high momentum throughout the battle.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the user's Speed stat by one stage (+1).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise Speed.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Setup Utility / Momentum Builder.
* **Usage:** Trailblaze serves as the Grass-type equivalent to *Flame Charge*. While its raw damage output is low, it is primarily used as a "finishing blow" or a tactical setup move to patch up a Pokémon's middling Speed tier. It allows Physical attackers to outpace common Choice Scarf users or faster threats after a single use. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. It is not a punching or pulse move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (328 learners), making it one of the most accessible coverage and setup options in the Paldea region.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by Physical Grass-type threats like **Meowscarada**, **Rillaboom**, **Ogerpon**, and **Venusaur** to gain an immediate Speed advantage while dealing STAB damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often equipped by non-Grass Physical wallbreakers such as **Haxorus**, **Ursaluna**, and **Lucario**. For these Pokémon, the move provides vital Speed control and allows them to bypass traditional checks like Dondozo or Great Tusk.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as **TM020** in *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*, accessible early in the game to a vast majority of the Pokédex.
