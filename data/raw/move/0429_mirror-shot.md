## Identity & Mechanics
**Mirror Shot** is a Special Steel-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user looses a concentrated flash of energy or a shimmering beam reflected from its polished, metallic body. This blinding light is designed to disorient the opponent, making it difficult for them to track their target. Its visual themes involve reflectivity, mirrors, and metallic brilliance.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a significant chance to disrupt the opponent's vision.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to lower the target’s **Accuracy** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Mid-game Special STAB / Disruption.
* **Usage:** Mirror Shot is generally considered a niche or "bridge" move. In competitive play, it is almost universally outclassed by **Flash Cannon**, which offers higher Base Power (80) and perfect Accuracy (100%). However, Mirror Shot's 30% chance to lower accuracy—compared to Flash Cannon's 10% Special Defense drop—provides a higher probability of forced switches or missed attacks from the opponent. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special beam. It is blocked by the Ability **Bulletproof**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (20 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with metallic or crystalline compositions.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized during the leveling phase by **Magnezone**, **Klinklang**, and the Mythical Pokémon **Magearna**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on the **Vanilluxe** line or **Wormadam-Trash** as a way to hit Rock-type threats that resist their primary STAB. Legendary Pokémon **Necrozma** (including its Dusk Mane and Ultra forms) also has access to this move.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it is notable for its lack of TM/TR availability in most generations, making its distribution strictly natural.
