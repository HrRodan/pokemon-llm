## Identity & Mechanics
**Infernal Parade** is a Special Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user summons a haunting procession of myriad spectral fireballs to swarm and assault the target. This eerie manifestation of spiritual energy bridges the gap between the ghostly realm and the searing heat of the underworld, often leaving the target scorched by supernatural flames.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and has a high chance to burn the target. The move's power is doubled to **120** if the target is already afflicted with any non-volatile status condition (Burn, Paralysis, Poison, Sleep, or Frostbite/Freeze).
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to Burn the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (120 if status), Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Status Exploiter / Conditional Nuke.** It functions as a signature upgrade to the move *Hex*.
* **Usage:** While its base power is modest, its ability to self-enable is significant. Unlike *Hex*, which relies on other moves to inflict status, Infernal Parade’s 30% burn chance allows the user to fishing for status and then immediately capitalize on the double-damage multiplier. It is a strictly better alternative to **Shadow Ball** or **Hex** for its specific users, providing both utility (Burn) and massive damage potential. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. It is a projectile-based move that benefits from Ghost-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (1 learner), serving as a unique Signature Move.
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, the move is the signature move of **Hisuian Typhlosion**. It reflects the Pokémon’s lore as a purifier of lost spirits. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not seen on other Pokémon. However, on Hisuian Typhlosion, it serves as the primary offensive tool to threaten physical attackers with a Burn while simultaneously acting as a high-powered STAB nuke.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it must be learned through leveling up by Hisuian Typhlosion.
