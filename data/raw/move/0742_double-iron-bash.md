## Identity & Mechanics
**Double Iron Bash** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! and Let's Go, Eevee!).
* **Description:** The user centers the massive hex nut in its chest and spins its torso with incredible torque, striking the target twice in rapid succession with its heavy, liquid-metal arms. This rotational momentum creates a relentless assault designed to overwhelm the opponent's defenses.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage twice in a single turn. Because it is a multi-hit move, it can break through **Substitute**, **Focus Sash**, and the **Sturdy** ability if the first hit depletes the target's HP to the required threshold.
* **Secondary Effect:** Each hit has a 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**. Due to the two-hit mechanic, the cumulative probability of causing a flinch is approximately **51%** if both hits land.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (Per hit, 120 Total), Accuracy 100%, PP 5.
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Signature Nuke.** 
* **Usage:** Double Iron Bash is one of the most powerful Steel-type moves in the game. It significantly outclasses **Iron Head** in both raw damage and flinch probability. It is particularly devastating when used against **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types. In competitive tiers like Smogon OU (where Melmetal was previously legal), it serves as a primary win condition, especially when paired with a Choice Band or used under Trick Room.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning its power is boosted by 20% by the **Iron Fist** ability (increasing its effective base power to 144 before STAB).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** It is the **Signature Move** of the Mythical Pokémon **Melmetal**. No other Pokémon can naturally learn or sketch this move in standard play.
* **Coverage Utility:** Since the move is exclusive to Melmetal, it is not used for coverage by other types. However, on Melmetal, it provides essential STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) that allows it to check top-tier threats like Clefable, Togekiss, and Weavile.
* **Acquisition:** It is not available via **TM/TR/HM** or Move Tutor. Melmetal typically learns it upon evolution or via the Move Reminder in Generations VIII and IX.
