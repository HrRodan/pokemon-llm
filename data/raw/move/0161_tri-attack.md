## Identity & Mechanics
**Tri-Attack** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user manifests three distinct orbs of elemental energy—fire, ice, and electricity—and converges them into a singular, multifaceted beam. This synchronized assault strikes the target with a chaotic burst of energy that can disrupt their physical state in unpredictable ways.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard damage. It possesses a unique secondary effect that rolls for a status condition from a pool of three possibilities.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to either **Burn**, **Freeze**, or **Paralyze** the target. Only one of these effects can occur per hit, with each having roughly a 6.67% individual chance.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Utility Nuke.
* **Usage:** While its base power is moderate, Tri-Attack is prized for its high "hax" potential—the ability to swing a match through a lucky Freeze or Paralyze. It is often compared to **Hyper Voice**, which offers slightly more power (90) and bypasses Substitutes, but lacks the status-inflicting utility. Because it is a Normal-type move, it deals **no Super Effective** damage but provides neutral coverage against the majority of the Pokédex. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, and **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact, Special move. Incredibly potent when paired with the ability **Serene Grace**, which doubles the secondary effect chance to 40%.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (65 learners), primarily found among artificial, mechanical, or multi-headed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature-style STAB move for the **Porygon line (Porygon2, Porygon-Z)**, especially Porygon-Z which boosts its power further with Adaptability. Other iconic users include **Dodrio**, **Magnezone**, and the Legendary **Terapagos**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally utilized by **Togekiss** to abuse Serene Grace or by **Silvally** as a reliable Special STAB option. It also appears in the movepools of diverse Special attackers like **Hydreigon** and **Dragapult**.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available as a TM in Gen I (TM49) and notably returned as **TM76** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield).
