## Identity & Mechanics
**Petal Dance** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user attacks by scattering a chaotic storm of flower petals in a rhythmic, dancing motion. This elegant but relentless assault continues for several turns, overwhelming the target with botanical energy before the repetitive motion leaves the user dizzy and disoriented.
* **Effect:** The user is locked into using this move for 2–3 consecutive turns. During this period, the trainer cannot select other moves or switch the Pokémon out. After the final turn of the dance, the user becomes **Confused**. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to inflict **Confusion** on the user after the sequence ends.
* **Targeting:** Random Opponent (In double/triple battles, the move may hit a random adjacent foe each turn).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Special Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Petal Dance is the Grass-type equivalent to *Outrage* and *Thrash*. It offers massive immediate damage with perfect accuracy, making it a terrifying tool for breaking through bulky Water, Ground, and Rock types. However, the lock-in mechanic is a significant liability, as it allows opponents to switch in a **Steel, Poison, or Dragon-type** resist and set up freely while the user is trapped. It is most effectively used as a late-game cleaning tool or on Pokémon with the **Own Tempo** ability to negate the self-inflicted confusion.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypassed by Protect/Detect on subsequent turns if the initial hit fails.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow, flavor-specific distribution (24 learners), primarily limited to floral and plant-based Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Venusaur**, **Vileplume**, **Roserade**, and **Arboliva**. 
* **Best-in-Class Synergy:** **Lilligant** (both Unovan and Hisuian) is the most famous user of this move due to the ability **Own Tempo**, which prevents the confusion drawback, and its access to *Quiver Dance* for a devastating sweep.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on the **Florges** line; as a pure Fairy-type, Florges uses Petal Dance as its primary high-power coverage to threaten heavy Water and Ground types.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via Level-up or Egg Move; it is rarely available as a TM or TR, maintaining its status as a specialized move for botanical specialists.
