## Identity & Mechanics
**Behemoth Bash** is a Physical Steel-type move introduced in Generation VIII.
* **Description:** The user, specifically Zamazenta in its Crowned Shield form, channels its legendary energy to transform its body into a colossal, impenetrable shield. It then charges forward with immense force, slamming its weighted bulk into the opponent. This move is characterized by its massive impact and is designed to counteract the overwhelming power of the Dynamax phenomenon.
* **Effect:** Deals standard damage to the target. However, if the target is currently Dynamaxed or Gigantamaxed, the damage is doubled (200 base power).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Anti-Dynamax Nuke.
* **Usage:** Behemoth Bash serves as the primary offensive tool for Zamazenta-Crowned. In the context of the Generation VIII VGC and BSS formats, it acted as a vital check to Dynamax sweepers. Compared to its movepool rival, **Iron Head** (from which Behemoth Bash transforms), it offers significantly higher consistent damage but sacrifices the 30% flinch chance. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs. It is also classified as a "transformation" move, as it specifically replaces Iron Head in battle when the user is in its Crowned form.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Zamazenta (Crowned Shield)**. The move is only accessible when Zamazenta enters battle holding the **Rusted Shield** item and knows the move Iron Head.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is exclusive to a specific form of a Legendary Pokémon, it is never seen as coverage on other Pokémon. Its utility is entirely centered on Zamazenta’s role as a defensive pivot and anti-meta attacker.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is a form-conditional move transformation that occurs automatically in-battle during Generation VIII and IX.
