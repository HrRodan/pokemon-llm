## Identity & Mechanics
**Skill Swap** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user utilizes its psychic prowess to create a mental resonance with the target, forcibly exchanging their innate abilities. This move allows a Pokémon to shed a detrimental trait or seize a powerful tactical advantage from an opponent, disrupting their core strategy through telepathic manipulation.
* **Effect:** The user and the target exchange their Abilities. This move ignores accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring the swap occurs unless the target is protected by specific moves or semi-invulnerable states. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it fails if either Pokémon has an unchangeable ability such as *Multitype*, *Wonder Guard*, *Stance Change*, *Schooling*, *Comatose*, *Shields Down*, *RKS System*, *Neutralizing Gas*, *Hunger Switch*, *Gulp Missile*, or *Ice Scales*.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (including allies in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —-%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Tactical Utility / Disruptor / Setup Enabler.
* **Usage:** Primarily a niche pick in Singles to cripple "Ability-reliant" walls (e.g., stealing *Regenerator* from Toxapex or *Unaware* from Clefable). In **Doubles/VGC**, it is a high-level technical choice used to reset weather/terrain or to remove crippling abilities like *Truant* from Slaking or *Slow Start* from Regigigas by swapping them onto an opponent. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **N/A** (Status move), but its Psychic typing allows it to be used by many high-utility Special attackers.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; fails against targets behind a Substitute (in most generations).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (184 learners), predominantly found among Psychic and Ghost types.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Cresselia**, **Alakazam**, **Gardevoir**, and **Mew**. **Cresselia** in particular uses it in VGC to cycle *Levitate* or disrupt opposing weather synergies.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on niche Pokémon like **Spinda** (to pass the *Contrary* ability to an ally) or **Sableye** to disrupt Prankster mirrors. It is also a staple for **Exeggutor** or **Trevenant** in "Infinite Harvest" shiny-hunting builds.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generations III, IV, VIII, and IX, and frequently offered by Move Tutors in various regions.
