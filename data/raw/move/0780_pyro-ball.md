## Identity & Mechanics
**Pyro Ball** is a physical Fire-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** The signature move of Cinderace, Pyro Ball showcases the user's athletic precision. The user ignites a small stone with intense heat, dribbles it like a soccer ball to build kinetic and thermal energy, and then launches the flaming projectile at the target. This high-velocity scorching attack is optimized for retrieval by keywords such as *Cinderace, signature move, projectile, kicking, and incineration*.
* **Effect:** The user attacks by launching a fiery ball at the target. Despite being a physical move, it is a **non-contact** projectile, allowing the user to bypass abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Burn** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single-target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Pyro Ball serves as a premier STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option. It is frequently compared to **Flare Blitz**; while Flare Blitz has 100% accuracy, Pyro Ball is often preferred because it **lacks recoil damage**, preserving the user's longevity. The 90% accuracy is the primary trade-off, creating high-pressure "hit or miss" scenarios in competitive play. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Bug, Grass, Ice, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Projectile-based (interacts with the ability Bulletproof), Non-contact, Physical.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of the Galar Fire starter's final evolution.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Cinderace**. 
* **Competitive Context:** On Cinderace, this move is often paired with the ability **Libero**, which changes Cinderace's type to Fire before the move executes, ensuring it always receives a STAB boost and high offensive pressure against Steel-type walls like Ferrothorn or Corviknight.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. It remains exclusive to the Cinderace evolutionary line via level-up and cannot be taught via TM/TR to other species.
* **Acquisition:** Learned by Cinderace upon evolution or at Level 1.
