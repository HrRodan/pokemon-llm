## Identity & Mechanics
**Vacuum Wave** is a Special Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user rapidly whirls its fists or manipulates the atmosphere to generate a concentrated wave of pure vacuum pressure. This distortion in air pressure strikes the target with kinetic force before they can react. Because it relies on the displacement of air rather than physical impact, it is one of the rare Special-category priority moves.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a priority of +1. It will typically strike before moves with a priority of 0, regardless of the user's Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** **Special Priority / Revenge Killer.**
* **Usage:** Vacuum Wave serves as the Special-category counterpart to *Mach Punch*. It is essential for Special Attackers to pick off weakened foes or to bypass the Speed of "Glass Cannon" threats. While its base power is low, it is highly valued for its ability to circumvent Speed control (like Choice Scarf or Tailwind). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite the flavor text mentioning "whirling fists," it is **not** a contact move and is **not** boosted by Iron Fist. It is a Special projectile.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (60 learners), primarily found among Fighting-types and Pokémon with high martial arts or air-manipulation themes.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Lucario:** The most iconic user, often utilizing *Nasty Plot* boosted Vacuum Wave to sweep teams.
    * **Ursaluna (Bloodmoon):** A top-tier competitive threat that uses Vacuum Wave to compensate for its low Speed, allowing it to pick off targets after a *Mind's Eye* boosted Blood Moon.
    * **Iron Valiant:** Uses this move on Special or Mixed sets to provide much-needed priority in the Paradox meta.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Sceptile** or **Infernape** to provide a fast response to Dark or Steel-type threats in lower competitive tiers.
* **Acquisition:** It has fluctuated in availability but is currently widely accessible as a **TM** in *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet* (TM167).
