## Identity & Mechanics
**Gunk Shot** is a Physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user gathers a massive heap of toxic sludge, industrial refuse, and filthy garbage, hurling the biohazardous projectile at the target with explosive force. This move is characterized by its high-velocity impact and the lingering stench of decomposing waste, making it one of the most powerful and repulsive physical attacks in the Pokémon repertoire.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant physical damage to a single target. It is one of the premier "high-power, low-accuracy" moves, trading reliability for sheer destructive force.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to inflict the **Poison** status condition on the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 80%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Gunk Shot is the primary high-damage option for Physical Poison-type attackers, serving as a more powerful but less accurate alternative to **Poison Jab**. Its massive base power allows users to threaten a 2HKO on bulky neutral targets or potentially OHKO defensive **Fairy-types**, which have historically dominated the competitive landscape. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a physical move involving "garbage," it is generally a non-contact move in most generations, allowing the user to bypass effects like *Rocky Helmet* or *Rough Skin*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (139 learners), often given to Pokémon associated with pollution, filth, or those with versatile physical movepools.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Muk (and Alolan Muk)**, **Garbodor**, **Toxapex**, and the Generation 9 powerhouse **Sneasler**. **Overqwil** also utilizes it as a heavy-hitting primary STAB option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by high-tier threats like **Greninja** and **Cinderace** (via Protean/Libero) to specifically target and eliminate Fairy-type checks like Tapu Fini or Clefable. It is also a common coverage choice for **Infernape** and **Annihilape** to surprise defensive Grass or Fairy types.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** in recent generations (including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple late-game addition to many physical attackers' movepools.
