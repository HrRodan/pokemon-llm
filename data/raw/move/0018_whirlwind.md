## Identity & Mechanics
**Whirlwind** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user whips up a powerful, localized cyclonic gust of wind that physically uproots the target, forcing them off the battlefield. In competitive play, this is a "phazing" (pseudo-hazing) tool used to disrupt the opponent's momentum. In the wild, the intense winds end the encounter immediately by blowing the opposition away.
* **Effect:** In Trainer battles, it forces the target to switch out for a random, un-fainted Pokémon in the opponent's party. This effect fails against Pokémon with the **Suction Cups** ability or those under the influence of the move **Ingrain**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to force switch unless blocked by specific abilities/moves).
* **Targeting:** Selected individual Pokémon. It bypasses accuracy checks, meaning it will always hit unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Phazer (Pseudo-Hazer).
* **Usage:** Whirlwind is a cornerstone of defensive playstyles. Its primary purpose is to **neutralize setup sweepers** by forcing them to switch out, thereby resetting their stat boosts (e.g., Dragon Dance or Calm Mind). It has **-6 Priority**, meaning the user will almost always move last. It is frequently paired with **Entry Hazards** (Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes) to rack up "passive damage" as the opponent is forced to cycle through their team.
* **Context:** It is functionally identical to **Roar**, but with one major competitive advantage: Whirlwind is **not a sound-based move**, meaning it cannot be blocked by the **Soundproof** ability (making it superior for hitting Pokémon like Kommo-o or Electrode).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion checks; negative priority move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (62 learners), primarily found among Flying-types and heavy, bulky Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Highly utilized by premier defensive walls like **Skarmory**, **Lugia**, and **Ting-Lu**. **Hippowdon** also uses it effectively to cycle through teams while sandstorm damage accumulates.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on bulky offensive threats like **Snorlax** and **Hariyama** to prevent opponents from using them as "setup fodder."
* **Acquisition:** Originally TM04 in Generation I, it transitioned into a move learned primarily via Level Up or as a specialized Egg Move in later generations. It is less common as a universal TM/TR compared to Roar.
