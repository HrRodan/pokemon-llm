## Identity & Mechanics
**Sparkly Swirl** is a Special Fairy-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically as an exclusive signature move for the Partner Eevee in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*.
* **Description:** The user conjures and unleashes a shimmering, overpowering whirlwind of sweet-smelling scents and magical energy that envelops the target. This dazzling display of Fairy power not only batters the opponent but also radiates a soothing aura that purifies the user's entire team.
* **Effect:** Deals high-magnitude special damage to a single target. Upon successful execution, it functions as a "Cleric" move, curing the user and all Pokémon in the user’s party of all non-volatile status conditions (Burn, Paralysis, Sleep, Poison, and Freeze).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to heal the party's status conditions (inherent move effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 85%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Ultimate Utility STAB.
* **Usage:** Sparkly Swirl is arguably the most powerful utility move in the *Let's Go* meta. It combines the raw power of a move like **Moonblast** or **Hydro Pump** with the team-wide support of **Aromatherapy** or **Heal Bell**. While the 85% accuracy introduces a risk of missing, the reward is a massive offensive hit that simultaneously resets any momentum lost to status effects like Toxic or Thunder Wave. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Dragon, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Special attack and does not make contact. It is classified as a "Partner Move."

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being limited to a single specific Pokémon (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Partner Eevee** (the starter Pokémon from *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*). 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to the starter Eevee, it is not used for coverage by other species. However, for Eevee, it provides essential **Fairy-type STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) which is vital for checking powerful Dragon and Fighting types in the Kanto-exclusive meta.
* **Acquisition:** It is taught by the **Move Tutor** located in the Celadon City Pokémon Center specifically in the *Let's Go* series. It is not available via TM, TR, or in later core-series titles (Generations VIII and IX).
