## Identity & Mechanics
**Hydro Steam** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user releases a pressurized blast of scalding, vaporized water at the target. Unlike traditional aqueous attacks that are extinguished by intense heat, this move utilizes thermal energy to increase its lethality. It is the signature move of the Paradox Pokémon Walking Wake, designed to bridge the gap between Water-type offense and Harsh Sunlight team archetypes.
* **Effect:** Deals damage. Uniquely, this move’s power is not reduced by 50% in Harsh Sunlight. Instead, its base power is increased by 50% when used during Harsh Sunlight.
* **Secondary Effect:** 0% (This move does not have a secondary status effect chance, distinguishing it from Scald).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80 (120 in Sun), Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Sun-Reliant Wallbreaker / Specialized STAB.
* **Usage:** Hydro Steam is a revolutionary move in the competitive meta because it bypasses the traditional "Sun nerf" for Water moves. In Harsh Sunlight, it reaches a base power of 120, which is then further multiplied by the weather's 1.5x damage boost for Water moves, resulting in an effective **180 Power** before STAB. This allows a Water-type to function as a primary sweeper on Sun teams alongside Fire-types and Protosynthesis users. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Long-range (non-contact), Special, affected by Protect and Mirror Move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the signature move of a single Pokémon (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Walking Wake**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Walking Wake is a Water/Dragon-type with the **Protosynthesis** ability, Hydro Steam is the linchpin of its kit, allowing it to threaten Fire-types (like Torkoal or Cinderace) that would usually feel safe under the Sun.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is only learned by Walking Wake upon being caught or via Level 1 starting moves.
