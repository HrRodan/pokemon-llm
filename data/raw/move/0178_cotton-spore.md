## Identity & Mechanics
**Cotton Spore** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user releases a dense cloud of sticky, clinging cotton fibers or downy spores from its body. These fibers adhere to the opponent’s limbs and wings, significantly increasing wind resistance and physical weight to hinder their mobility and reflexes.
* **Effect:** Sharply reduces the target's Speed stat by two stages (halving their current speed).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to induce stat drop).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (In Double and Triple Battles, it hits multiple foes simultaneously).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Speed Control / Utility / Setup Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Primarily used to neutralize high-speed threats or Choice Scarf users. In Double Battles, its "All Opponents" targeting makes it an efficient form of speed control compared to single-target moves. It is often compared to **Thunder Wave**; while it lacks the "Full Paralysis" chance, it offers a more drastic speed reduction (-66% vs -50% in modern gens) and can hit Ground-types, though it is blocked by Grass-types and the ability Overcoat.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage, but it is ineffective against **Grass-type** Pokémon (starting in Gen VI) and those holding **Safety Goggles**.
* **Attributes:** **Powder-based move** (Interactable with Overcoat and Safety Goggles); non-contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (17 learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with "fluffy" or botanical designs.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Whimsicott** (who can utilize it with the *Prankster* ability for priority speed control), **Jumpluff**, and the **Ampharos** evolutionary line. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Cacturne** or **Eldegoss** to allow these slower-paced Pokémon to outspeed threats after a single turn of setup.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned through natural level-up; it is rarely available as a TM or TR, making its distribution highly exclusive to specific biological archetypes.
