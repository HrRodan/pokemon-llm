## Identity & Mechanics
**Stockpile** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its internal energy, bracing its body and expanding its physical presence to absorb incoming strikes. This rhythmic charging process allows the user to "bulk up" up to three times, visually inflating or glowing with stored power. It serves as the foundational move for a tactical trio, acting as the battery for the follow-up moves *Spit Up* and *Swallow*.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Defense and Special Defense stats by one stage each. It stores a "count" of energy (maximum of 3). These counts are consumed by specific moves or lost upon switching out. If the user uses *Baton Pass*, the defensive stat boosts are transferred to the teammate, but the stored energy counts are not.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The energy storage is a primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Utility Tanking.
* **Usage:** Stockpile is a niche defensive tool used to transform a Pokémon into an unbreakable wall. While it mimics the effects of *Cosmic Power*, it is restricted by a 3-use cap. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to provide dual-spectrum bulk simultaneously. It is often compared to *Curse* or *Iron Defense*; while Stockpile provides less specialized physical protection, its ability to shore up Special Defense makes it a "Consistency Option" for mixed tanks. It is particularly effective on Pokémon with high HP but mediocre defensive stats.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage. However, by raising defenses, it helps the user check a wide variety of offensive threats across all types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses protection (Snatch-able).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (55 learners), primarily found among bulky, "inflated," or "consuming" themed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Snorlax**, **Drifblim**, and **Pelipper**. It is a signature defensive option for **Greedent** and **Swalot**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on bulky Poison-types like **Toxapex (Mareanie)** and **Garbodor** to maximize their longevity while stalling with Toxic or hazards. **Guzzlord** utilizes it to bolster its massive HP pool with much-needed defensive multipliers.
* **Acquisition:** While not a mainstay TM in every generation, it is frequently available as an Egg Move or through Move Tutors in earlier generations, and was a common TR (Technical Record) in Gen VIII.
