## Identity & Mechanics
**Tera Starstorm** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user harnesses the concentrated energy of Terastal crystals to bombard the battlefield with a celestial shower of light, eliminating the opposition. While it manifests as a beam of prismatic energy, its true potential is unlocked when the user undergoes Terapagos's unique Stellar Transformation.
* **Effect:** This is the **Signature Move** of Terapagos. In its base and Terastal forms, it is a high-damage single-target Normal-type move. However, when used by **Stellar Form Terapagos**, the move's type changes to the **Stellar type**, and its targeting shifts to hit all opposing Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Pure raw damage).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Normal/Terastal Form) / **All Opponents** (Stellar Form).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power **120**, Accuracy **100%**, PP **5** (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Power Nuke / Spread Attacker.**
* **Usage:** Tera Starstorm is an elite offensive tool due to its perfect accuracy and massive base power. In its Stellar form, it becomes one of the most oppressive moves in the game, specifically in **VGC (Doubles)**, as it functions as a 120 BP spread move without the usual damage reduction associated with multi-target attacks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Terastallized Pokémon** of any type when in Stellar Form, while hitting all other types for neutral damage.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special beam-like attack. It bypasses many traditional resistances because the Stellar type interacts uniquely with the Tera mechanic, ensuring Terapagos is rarely walled.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (1 learner family).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Terapagos** (including its **Terastal** and **Stellar** forms). It is the cornerstone of Terapagos's kit, designed to capitalize on the **Tera Shell** and **Teraform Zero** abilities.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the move changes to the Stellar type upon Terapagos's transformation, it provides unparalleled **neutral coverage** against the entire metagame. No Pokémon naturally resists the Stellar-type Tera Starstorm unless they are protected by specific abilities or moves like Protect/Detect.
* **Acquisition:** This move is learned by Terapagos upon leveling up or transformation; it is **not available via TM/TR** and cannot be sketched or Mimicked effectively by other Pokémon to the same degree of power.
