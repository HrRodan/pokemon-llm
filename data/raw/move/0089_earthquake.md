## Identity & Mechanics
**Earthquake** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user sets off a massive seismic rupture that strikes every Pokémon on the field. This move represents the gold standard for offensive efficiency, generating intense tremors that bypass traditional defenses. It is a cornerstone of competitive play due to its perfect accuracy and high base power, though it famously fails to affect Flying-type foes or those with the Levitate ability.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target is currently in the underground semi-invulnerable turn of the move **Dig**, Earthquake bypasses the invulnerability and deals **double damage** (200 Base Power).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All adjacent Pokémon (strikes allies and enemies in Doubles/Triples).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Metagame Staple / Spread Attacker.
* **Usage:** Earthquake is widely considered the most consistent Physical move in the franchise. In Singles, it is a primary "Wallbreaker" tool due to its lack of drawbacks. In Doubles, it functions as a powerful spread move, though its damage is reduced by 25% when hitting multiple targets and requires a teammate with "Protect" or "Telepathy" to avoid friendly fire. It is frequently compared to **High Horsepower** (which is single-target) and **Earth Power** (its Special-category counterpart). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** **Non-contact** move (does not trigger Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs). Its power is halved if **Grassy Terrain** is active.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution (384 learners), making it one of the most accessible high-tier moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically synonymous with **Garchomp**, **Groudon** (and Primal Groudon), **Swampert**, and **Hippowdon**.
* **Coverage Utility:** An essential coverage option for non-Ground types to threaten Steel and Electric types; frequently equipped by **Gyarados**, **Dragonite**, **Tyranitar**, and **Snorlax**.
* **Acquisition:** Almost universally available via **TM26** (or TR10 in Gen 8) across every generation, often found as a late-game reward or high-value exploration prize.
