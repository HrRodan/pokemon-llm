## Identity & Mechanics
**Fire Spin** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a spiraling vortex of intense, scorching flames that encircles the target. This fiery pillar traps the opponent within a localized inferno, restricting movement and causing continuous heat-related distress over several turns.
* **Effect:** Inflicts initial damage and traps the target for 2–5 turns. While trapped, the target cannot switch out or flee and takes residual damage equal to 1/16th of its maximum HP at the end of each turn. The effect ends prematurely if the user leaves the field or if the target uses Rapid Spin or Mortal Spin.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to induce the **Trapping** status condition upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 35, Accuracy 85%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Utility / Partial Trapping.**
* **Usage:** Fire Spin is rarely used for its raw damage due to its low base power. Instead, it serves as a tactical tool for **"Trap and Stall"** strategies. By preventing a foe from switching, a player can force a favorable matchup, rack up residual damage with hazards or status (like Toxic), or safely setup with a teammate once the trapped foe is weakened. It is often compared to **Magma Storm**, which is strictly superior but exclusive to Heatran. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses "Protect" for the residual damage portion once active; blocked by "Bulletproof" in some iterations (though generally considered a vortex move).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (108 learners), being a staple move for many Fire-type families.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Charizard**, **Moltres**, **Entei**, and **Skeledirge**. In lower tiers or specific formats, **Ninetales** and **Torkoal** may use it to facilitate sun-based strategies.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon, particularly Dragon-types like **Dragonite**, **Hydreigon**, and **Flygon**, who use it to punish Steel-type switch-ins or to facilitate "Perish Song" or "Encore" trapping sets.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it easily accessible for competitive teambuilding.
