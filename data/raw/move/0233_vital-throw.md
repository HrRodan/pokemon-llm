## Identity & Mechanics
**Vital Throw** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user prepares to absorb an incoming attack, using the opponent's own momentum to execute a powerful grappling maneuver. This technique involves waiting for the target to strike first, then seizing and hurling them to the ground with such precision that the attack is guaranteed to connect regardless of the target's movements or visibility.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and bypasses all accuracy and evasion checks. Crucially, this move has a **priority of -1**, meaning the user will almost always move after the opponent in the same priority bracket.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (but features a built-in "Never-Miss" mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy --% (Always Hits), PP 10.
* **Role:** Low-Priority Reliable STAB / Anti-Evasion Utility.
* **Usage:** While its base power is respectable for a "never-miss" move, the negative priority is a significant drawback, forcing the user to take a hit before attacking. It is primarily used as a niche counter to **Evasion-stalling** strategies (like Minimize or Double Team). Compared to moves like *Close Combat* (higher power) or *Drain Punch* (sustainability), Vital Throw is a "Consistency Option" for bulky attackers who don't mind moving last. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is boosted by abilities like *Tough Claws*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (13 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon themed around wrestling, martial arts, or high physical strength.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic on **Machamp**, **Hariyama**, and **Throh**, all of whom embody the "tanky grappler" archetype that can survive a hit to land the throw.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Pinsir** (and its Mega Evolution) or the Ultra Beast **Buzzwole**, providing a reliable way to bypass accuracy-dropping moves or items like Bright Powder.
* **Acquisition:** Generally acquired through level-up; it is rarely available as a TM or TR, making it a specialized tool for natural learners rather than a universal coverage option.
