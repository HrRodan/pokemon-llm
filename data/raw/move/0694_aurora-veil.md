## Identity & Mechanics
**Aurora Veil** is a Status Ice-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user summons a shimmering, multicolored curtain of light—reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis—to protect itself and its allies. This mystical barrier hardens the team's defenses, significantly dampening the impact of incoming strikes. Because it draws power from the cold, it can only be manifested during a **Hailstorm** (or **Snow** in Generation IX).
* **Effect:** For five turns, it reduces damage from both Physical and Special attacks by 50% in Single Battles. In Double Battles, the damage reduction is approximately 33%. The move fails if the weather is not Hail or Snow, or if the weather is suppressed by abilities like Cloud Nine.
* **Secondary Effect:** None; however, the duration can be extended from 5 to 8 turns if the user is holding the **Light Clay** item.
* **Targeting:** User's Side (Field Effect).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Hyper-Offense Enabler** / **Screen Setter**.
* **Usage:** Aurora Veil is considered one of the most powerful supportive moves in the game because it compresses **Reflect** and **Light Screen** into a single turn. It is the cornerstone of "Hail/Snow" teams, allowing frail sweepers to set up boosting moves (like Dragon Dance or Quiver Dance) with much higher survivability. While its effect is superior to standard screens, its reliance on weather makes it vulnerable to weather-changing moves or abilities (like Drought or Sand Stream).
* **Attributes:** Screen-based effect. It can be removed by moves like **Defog**, **Brick Break**, or **Psychic Fangs**, and bypassed by the ability **Infiltrator**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, limited almost exclusively to Ice-type Pokémon (22 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** **Alolan Ninetales** and **Abomasnow** are the premier users because their **Snow Warning** ability automatically sets the weather required to use the move instantly. **Iron Bundle** is also a notable user in higher tiers due to its immense Speed, allowing it to set the veil before the opponent can move.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely seen on non-STAB Pokémon due to the weather requirement, **Mew** can utilize it on dedicated weather-themed experimental teams. **Articuno** occasionally uses it in lower tiers to bolster its natural bulk.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM70** in Sun/Moon and Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon, and remains a signature utility option for Ice-types in subsequent generations via TM or move reminder.
