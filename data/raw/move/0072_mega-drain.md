## Identity & Mechanics
**Mega-Drain** is a Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user leaches the target's life energy with a surge of parasitic power. This attack siphons the health of the opponent, transferring their vitality directly to the user to mend wounds and restore stamina. It acts as an intermediate vampiric attack, bridging the gap between the weaker Absorb and the potent Giga Drain.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and restores the user's HP by 50% of the damage dealt. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon (Non-adjacent in Triple Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Early-game Sustainability / Transitional STAB.
* **Usage:** In modern competitive play, Mega-Drain is almost entirely outclassed by **Giga Drain**, which offers significantly higher Power (75 or 80 depending on the generation) for the same healing percentage. However, in "Little Cup" (LC) formats or during early-game progression, it serves as a vital tool for bulky Grass-types to maintain longevity while chipping away at opponents. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **healing move**; its recovery is boosted by the **Big Root** item (increasing healing by 30%) and it is blocked by the effect of **Heal Block**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (102 learners), reflecting its status as a fundamental Grass-type ability.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Grass-type starters and specialists like **Venusaur**, **Sceptile**, and **Serperior** utilize this as they grow in power. It is also a staple for "mushroom-based" Pokémon like **Amoonguss** and **Shiinotic**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Surprisingly, it is learned by several non-Grass types for niche utility, including **Gengar**, **Celesteela**, and **Palossand**. These Pokémon use it to exploit 4x weaknesses in Rock/Ground types while providing self-sustenance. 
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM21** in Generation I. In later generations, its availability as a TM has fluctuated, often being replaced by its superior counterpart, Giga Drain, in the TM/TR lists.
