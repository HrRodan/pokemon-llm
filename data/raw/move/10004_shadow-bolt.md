## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Bolt** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically within *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user manifests a discharge of corrupted, dark electricity that strikes the opponent. As a Shadow move, it represents the heart of a Pokémon being artificially closed, resulting in a volatile energy that manifests as an eerie, purple-tinted bolt of lightning.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. In its home game (*Pokémon XD*), Shadow moves are uniquely **Super Effective** against all non-Shadow Pokémon and "Not Very Effective" against other Shadow Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Paralyze** the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (N/A).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB-Equivalent / Shadow Coverage. 
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, Shadow Bolt serves as a mid-tier consistency option. While it lacks the raw power of *Shadow Storm*, its perfect accuracy and paralysis chance make it a reliable tool for chipping down and disabling opponents for easier snagging. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow** Pokémon types, making it an incredibly versatile offensive tool regardless of the opponent's elemental typing.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses traditional type resistances (except against Shadow Pokémon); Special Damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution, limited strictly to **Shadow Pokémon** encountered in the Orre Region (*Pokémon XD*).
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users from *Pokémon XD* include **Shadow Jolteon** (one of the potential Eeveelution starters), **Shadow Mareep**, and **Shadow Magneton**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because the "Shadow" type exists outside the standard type chart, it provides universal coverage. It is effectively the "Standard" special attack for Electric-type Shadow Pokémon before they are purified.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor; it is hard-coded into the move-set of specific Shadow Pokémon until they undergo the purification process, at which point the move is replaced (often by Thunderbolt or Spark).
