* **Role:** Speed Control / Utility Support.

It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Flying** and **Water** types.
* **Attributes:** As a spread move, its damage is reduced by 25% in Double Battles, but it remains one of the few Electric-type utility moves that provides guaranteed stat modification without relying on the RNG of Paralysis.
