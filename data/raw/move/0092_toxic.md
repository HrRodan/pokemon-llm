## Identity & Mechanics
**Toxic** is a Status Poison-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user secretes or exhales a concentrated, corrosive venom that inflicts the "Badly Poisoned" status condition. Unlike regular poison, this lethal toxin becomes increasingly painful over time, with the damage intensifying every turn the target remains on the field. It is a cornerstone of defensive playstyles and attrition-based strategies.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Badly Poisoned** status. The victim loses 1/16th of its maximum HP on the first turn, and the damage increases by 1/16th each subsequent turn (2/16, 3/16, etc.).
* **Secondary Effect:** As of Generation VI, this move **bypasses accuracy checks** (never misses) when used by a Poison-type Pokémon, even during the semi-invulnerable turns of moves like Fly or Dig.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 90% (Variable), PP 10.
* **Role:** Passive Damage Win-Condition / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Toxic is the premier "Stall" tool in competitive Pokémon. It is used to put a timer on defensive behemoths (Walls) that rely on recovery, eventually forcing them out or knocking them out. While its 90% accuracy is a risk for non-Poison types, the potential to cripple a physical or special sweepers' longevity makes it a high-reward utility choice. It is ineffective against **Steel** and **Poison** types, which are naturally immune to the condition.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; blocked by Magic Guard and cured by Natural Cure or Refresh.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a nearly universal distribution (977 learners), though its availability was significantly restricted in Generations VIII and IX.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on defensive anchors like **Toxapex**, **Blissey**, **Gliscor**, and **Umbreon**. **Toxapex** in particular benefits from the 100% accuracy mechanic.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on almost every viable Pokémon, including non-Poison threats like **Garchomp**, **Skarmory**, and **Heatran**, specifically to punish incoming switch-ins that they cannot hit hard with direct attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Toxic has been featured as **TM06** in almost every generation, making it one of the most accessible and influential technical machines in the series' history.
