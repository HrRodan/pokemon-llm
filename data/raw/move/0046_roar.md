## Identity & Mechanics
**Roar** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lets out a terrifying, bone-chilling shout that strikes fear into the heart of the opponent. This intimidating vocalization is so powerful that it compels wild Pokémon to flee the encounter immediately or forces a trainer's Pokémon to retreat back into its Poké Ball in a state of panic.
* **Effect:** In trainer battles, Roar forces the target to switch out for another random Pokémon in the opponent's party. In wild encounters, the battle ends instantly.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, it fails against Pokémon with the **Suction Cups** ability or those under the effect of **Ingrain**. As a sound-based move, it is also negated by the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —% (Ignores accuracy/evasion checks), PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Phazer (Pseudo-Hazer).
* **Usage:** Roar is primarily used for **"Phazing"** (forcing a switch to prevent an opponent from setting up). Because it has a **-6 Priority**, it almost always moves last, allowing the user to take a hit before forcing the opponent out. It is the premier tool for racking up chip damage in conjunction with **Entry Hazards** (Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes).
* **Context:** Roar is functionally identical to *Whirlwind*, though as a sound-based move, it is blocked by *Soundproof*, making Whirlwind slightly superior in niche scenarios. It is often preferred over *Dragon Tail* or *Circle Throw* on defensive walls that lack the offensive stats to make contact or fear being punished by *Rocky Helmet* or *Rough Skin*.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based move. Bypasses *Substitute* in later generations (Gen VI onwards).
