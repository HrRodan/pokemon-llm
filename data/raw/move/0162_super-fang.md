## Identity & Mechanics
**Super Fang** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lunges at the target and sinks its sharp, powerful incisors deep into the opponent, regardless of their size or defensive hide. This savage bite is designed to mechanically incapacitate a foe by instantly shearing away a massive portion of their vitality.
* **Effect:** Inflicts fixed damage equal to exactly **50% of the target's current HP**. Because it calculates damage based on remaining health rather than Attack and Defense stats, it is an effective tool for softening up even the most durable walls.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Fixed], Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Wallbreaker / Stall-Breaker.** 
* **Usage:** Super Fang is a premier utility move for defensive or supportive Pokémon that lack the offensive stats to deal significant damage otherwise. It is the primary rival to **Nature's Madness** (Fairy-type) and **Ruination** (Dark-type). While it is blocked by Ghost-types due to its Normal typing, it ignores the resistances of Rock and Steel types, making it a "guaranteed" chunk of damage against non-ghost tanks like **Dondozo**, **Garganacl**, or **Blissey**.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it cannot hit **Ghost** types (unless the user has the Scrappy Ability or uses Foresight). It is particularly effective for forcing progress against Pokémon that rely on high HP and Defense.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is boosted by the **Strong Jaw** ability in some contexts (though the HP-cut mechanic remains fixed).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (99 learners), primarily found among rodent-like Pokémon, bats, and various "toothy" predators.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Raticate** line (its signature move for years), **Crobat** (who uses its high Speed to lead with it), and **Maushold**, which uses it to soften targets for its teammates.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on utility-focused Pokémon like **Pachirisu** (notably used in its 2014 World Championship-winning set) and **Dedenne** to provide offensive pressure despite low base Attack stats.
* **Acquisition:** While historically limited to level-up pools, it has gained broader accessibility as **TM108** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
