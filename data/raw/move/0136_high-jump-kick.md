## Identity & Mechanics
**High Jump Kick** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user builds immense momentum, leaping high into the air before descending with a devastating, high-velocity knee strike aimed at the target. This acrobatic maneuver carries extreme kinetic energy but leaves the user vulnerable to a crash landing if the strike fails to connect.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. However, if the move misses, is blocked by a protection move (e.g., Protect, Detect, Baneful Bunker), or has no effect due to type immunity (Ghost-types), the user suffers "crash damage" equal to 50% of their maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though it is Hard-Coded to fail if **Gravity** is in effect.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** High Jump Kick is the quintessential "all-or-nothing" Fighting move. It is significantly more powerful than the reliable *Drain Punch* and possesses higher raw damage than *Close Combat*, without the defensive stat drops. However, the 10% miss chance and the catastrophic penalty for hitting a **Protect** or a **Ghost-type** switch-in make it a high-stakes prediction tool. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 learners), primarily limited to Pokémon known for their kicking prowess or martial arts mastery.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Hitmonlee** (its original signature user), **Blaziken** (utilizing Speed Boost to ensure it strikes first), and **Cinderace** (whose Libero ability ensures STAB-boosted damage). 
* **Competitive Staples:** **Mega Lopunny** is a premier user of this move; its *Scrappy* ability allows High Jump Kick to hit Ghost-types, effectively removing the move's biggest risk of failure. **Pheromosa** also utilizes it as a primary wallbreaking tool due to its elite Attack and Speed.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely seen as non-STAB coverage due to the high risk, it is occasionally utilized by **Hawlucha** as a powerful finisher to trigger Unburden strategies.
* **Acquisition:** Generally limited to level-up or Egg Move sets; it is not widely available as a TM/TR in most generations.
