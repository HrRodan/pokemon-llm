## Identity & Mechanics
**Bulk Up** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user tenses every muscle in its body, swelling with physical power while hardening its exterior against impact. This physical conditioning prepares the Pokémon for a prolonged confrontation, significantly increasing its brawn and resilience.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Attack and Defense stats by one stage each (+1 Atk, +1 Def).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Setup / Bulky Offense.
* **Usage:** Bulk Up is a staple for **Set-up Sweepers** that prioritize longevity over immediate raw power. Unlike *Swords Dance*, which provides a +2 Attack boost for quick KOs, Bulk Up allows a Pokémon to survive Physical hits while gradually becoming an unstoppable offensive threat. It is particularly effective on Pokémon with reliable recovery (like Roost or Drain Punch) to outlast opponents. While it provides no direct damage, it enhances the user's ability to deal **Super Effective** damage with Fighting-type STAB against **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** Not affected by Protect/Detect (unless targeted by specific niche moves), bypasses accuracy checks, and is commonly used in conjunction with the **Leftovers** item or **Rest/Talk** strategies.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (168 learners), appearing on nearly every Fighting-type and many physically imposing non-Fighting Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Corviknight** (for the "Bulk Up + Roost" win-condition), **Annihilape** (synergizing with Rage Fist and high natural bulk), and **Conkeldurr** (often paired with Guts or Drain Punch).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fighting Pokémon like **Cinderace**, **Incineroar**, and **Talonflame** to turn them into late-game win conditions against physical attackers. It is also a rare setup option for Legendary Pokémon like **Groudon** and **Dialga**.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in almost every generation since its introduction in Hoenn.
