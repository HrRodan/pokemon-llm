## Identity & Mechanics
**Sky Uppercut** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user delivers an explosive upward punch with enough momentum to carry them into the air. This soaring strike is specifically designed to intercept airborne targets, making it a rare anti-air physical attack. Visually, it represents a high-reaching martial arts technique meant to punish those attempting to escape into the sky.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. Uniquely, this move can bypass the semi-invulnerable state of moves like **Fly**, **Bounce**, and **Sky Drop**, hitting the opponent while they are mid-air.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Consistency Option / Punching Coverage.
* **Usage:** While outclassed in pure power by *Close Combat* (120 BP) and *High Jump Kick* (130 BP), Sky Uppercut serves as a reliable middle-ground for Pokémon that cannot afford the defensive drops of the former or the recoil risk of the latter. Its accuracy (90%) makes it slightly more prone to missing than *Drain Punch* or *Brick Break*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Punching** move, meaning its power is boosted by 20% when used by a Pokémon with the **Iron Fist** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, naturally learned by only 14 Pokémon across the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Fighting-types such as **Blaziken**, **Hitmonchan** (who maximizes the damage via Iron Fist), and **Breloom** frequently utilize this as a primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option during mid-game progression.
* **Coverage Utility:** It is a vital coverage tool for **Gliscor** (Ground/Flying) and **Pangoro** (Dark/Fighting), allowing them to punish Steel and Ice types that would otherwise threaten them.
* **Acquisition:** Unlike many Fighting moves, Sky Uppercut is rarely available as a TM or TR, making it a specialized move primarily obtained through level-up or Breeding (Egg Moves).
