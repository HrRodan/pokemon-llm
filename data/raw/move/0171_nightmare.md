## Identity & Mechanics
**Nightmare** is a Status Ghost-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user weaves a horrific and haunting vision into the mind of a sleeping target, trapping them in a psychological loop of terror. This malevolent energy manifests as a dark aura that actively drains the life force of the victim as long as they remain unconscious. It is a specialized form of residual damage that punishes opponents for being inflicted with the Sleep status condition.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the Nightmare status on a sleeping target. While afflicted, the target loses 1/4 (25%) of its maximum HP at the end of every turn. The effect immediately ends if the target wakes up or is switched out of battle.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Residual Damage / Niche Stallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Nightmare is a highly situational utility move that functions as a "Sleep-punisher." It is most effective when paired with reliable sleep-inducing moves like **Hypnosis**, **Spore**, or **Lovely Kiss**. Unlike the Ghost-type version of *Curse*, it does not require the user to sacrifice its own HP; however, its dependency on the target remaining asleep makes it less reliable than other forms of passive damage like Toxic or Sandstorm. It is often compared to Darkrai’s **Bad Dreams** ability, which provides the same effect passively without occupying a move slot.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks if the target is already asleep (Gen 2-3 mechanics varied, but generally 100% accurate); blocked by *Magic Coat* and *Magic Bounce*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (76 learners), primarily found among Ghost and Psychic-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Gengar**, **Hypno**, and **Darkrai**, all of whom have access to sleep-inducing moves to facilitate the Nightmare setup.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on high-tier Psychic and Ghost threats like **Alakazam**, **Mewtwo**, and **Banette** to force switches against bulky walls that rely on *Rest* for recovery.
* **Acquisition:** It was widely available as **TM50** in the Johto region (Generation II) and has since become a recurring move via Move Tutors or level-up for "creepy" or dream-themed Pokémon.
