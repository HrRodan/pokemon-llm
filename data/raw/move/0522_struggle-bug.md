## Identity & Mechanics
**Struggle Bug** is a Special Bug-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user flails or vibrates its wings/body in a defensive display of resistance, emitting a disruptive frequency that strikes all opposing Pokémon. This tactical strike focuses on breaking the opponent's concentration, effectively muffling their special offensive capabilities.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to lower the target's Special Attack stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to drop Special Attack (guaranteed unless blocked by abilities like Clear Body or Substitute).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Debuffing Pivot.
* **Usage:** While its low base power prevents it from being a primary offensive threat, it serves as the Bug-type equivalent to *Snarl* or *Icy Wind*. In VGC and Double Battles, it is a potent "Special Snarl," allowing the user to neuter the damage output of opposing Special Attackers (like Flutter Mane or Calyrex-Shadow) across the entire field. It is preferred over damage-heavy moves when longevity and team support are the priority. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic, Dark, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a spread attack that does not make contact. It is particularly effective at punishing lead Special Sweepers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among arthropod-based Pokémon and certain mystical creatures (95 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Volcarona**, **Genesect**, and **Ribombee** to provide defensive utility while maintaining offensive pressure. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Bug Pokémon such as **Flygon** and the Paradox Pokémon **Iron Moth** to provide valuable Special Attack suppression in competitive formats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in Generation V, VI, and IX, making it a staple tech-option for many team archetypes.
