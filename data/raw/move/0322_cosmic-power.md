## Identity & Mechanics
**Cosmic Power** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn region).
* **Description:** The user absorbs a mysterious, celestial energy from the depths of space, enveloping its body in a shimmering cosmic aura. This mystical reinforcement bolsters the user's physical molecular structure and mental focus, significantly hardening its defenses against all forms of incoming damage.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Defense and Special Defense stats by one stage each (+1 Def / +1 Sp. Def).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Win-Condition Enabler.
* **Usage:** While it provides no immediate offensive pressure, Cosmic Power is the cornerstone of "Stall-and-Sweep" strategies. It is most effectively paired with the move **Stored Power**, which increases in damage for every stat stage boost the user possesses. Compared to moves like *Calm Mind* or *Iron Defense*, Cosmic Power offers balanced dual-spectrum bulk, making the user increasingly difficult to revenge kill with either Physical or Special attackers.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; non-contact; not blocked by *Bulletproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (54 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with extraterrestrial, celestial, or mystical origins.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Clefable:** Frequently utilizes Cosmic Power in tandem with the *Magic Guard* ability to become an unkillable win-condition that is immune to passive damage (toxic/hazards).
    * **Eternatus:** In high-level competitive play (Ubers), it uses its massive natural bulk and Cosmic Power to stall out entire teams.
    * **Jirachi:** Often runs defensive sets to capitalize on its excellent Steel/Psychic typing.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Sigilyph** and **Metagross** to facilitate "Stored Power" sweeps or to shore up defensive weaknesses during a setup phase.
* **Acquisition:** While initially limited to level-up pools, it became more accessible via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword & Shield).
