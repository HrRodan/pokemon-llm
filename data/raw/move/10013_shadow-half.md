## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Half** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically within the side-series title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user releases a massive, soul-chilling burst of dark energy that envelops the entire battlefield. This surge of shadow power ignores traditional elemental resistances to forcefully siphon away the vitality of every Pokémon present. Because of the immense energy required to manifest this rift, the user is left momentarily paralyzed and must recover its strength.
* **Effect:** Reduces the current HP of every Pokémon on the field (the user, the partner, and both opponents) by exactly 50%.
* **Secondary Effect:** The user must "recharge" on the following turn, during which it cannot attack or be switched out.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy 100%, PP [N/A].
* **Role:** Field-Wide Health Siphon / High-Risk Disruptor.
* **Usage:** Shadow Half functions as an "Anti-Stall" and "Wallbreaking" tool unique to the Shadow Pokémon mechanics of *Pokémon XD*. While most Shadow moves deal super-effective damage to non-Shadow Pokémon, Shadow Half deals **Fixed Damage**, making it an effective way to immediately soften up high-HP targets or "boss" encounters. However, its "Recharge" drawback and friendly fire make it extremely dangerous to use without a Protect-using partner or a Shadow-resistant ally. It deals fixed damage regardless of **Type Matchups**, though it is technically a Shadow-type move.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses type-based damage reductions; fixed percentage damage; identifies as a Special move for the purpose of Mirror Coat.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (0 learners in standard core-series games, exclusive to 1 specific encounter in *XD*).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Shadow Lugia (XD001)**. It serves as one of its signature maneuvers during the final boss encounter of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its nature as a "Shadow" move, it does not appear on standard movepools. It cannot be taught to other Pokémon via TM, TR, or Move Tutor.
* **Acquisition:** Only available on Shadow Lugia until it is purified; once purified into a standard Lugia, the move is lost and replaced with standard moves like Psycho Boost.
