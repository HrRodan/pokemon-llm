## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Strike** is a Physical (or Special) Normal-type move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** A powerful Dynamax-exclusive attack where the user focuses its massive energy to strike the target. The sheer force of the impact creates a lingering pressure that inhibits the target's movement, visually manifesting as a shockwave of neutral energy.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and **lowers the target's Speed stat by one stage**. This move bypasses accuracy checks, meaning it will always hit unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig) and the user does not have a way to bypass that state.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reduce the opponent's Speed.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies], Accuracy [—]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Speed Control Utility** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Unlike standard moves, Max Strike's power scales based on the base Normal-type move used to trigger it (e.g., a Max Strike based on *Giga Impact* has 150 Power, while one based on *Tackle* is much weaker). In the VGC and Smogon Dynamax metas, it is primarily used for **Speed Control**, allowing a slower Dynamax Pokémon to "out-slow" an opponent and move first on the subsequent turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **None** (Normal is never super effective), but hits most types for neutral damage. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Power is determined by the base move; transforms into a protective move (Max Guard) if the base move is a Status move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon capable of Dynamaxing that know at least one damaging Normal-type move.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Snorlax:** Often uses a high-BP Max Strike (from *Body Slam* or *Giga Impact*) to mitigate its low Speed and punish switch-ins.
    * **Porygon-Z:** Utilizes a Special-category Max Strike (from *Hyper Beam* or *Tri Attack*) boosted by *Adaptability* for extreme nuclear damage.
    * **Cinderace:** Frequently used Max Strike (from *Double-Edge*) to manipulate speed tiers while in its Dynamax form.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on various attackers like **Landorus-Therian** or **Gyarados** via *Giga Impact* or *Hyper Beam* to provide a source of Speed control when their STAB Max Moves aren't the optimal choice.
* **Acquisition:** Automatically replaces any damaging Normal-type move while a Pokémon is **Dynamaxed**.
