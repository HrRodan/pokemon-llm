## Identity & Mechanics
**Scale Shot** is a Physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user rapidly fires sharpened scales at the target like armor-piercing projectiles, striking multiple times in quick succession. This aggressive shedding of protective plating streamlines the user's body, significantly increasing their aerodynamic agility at the cost of physical durability.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage two to five times in a row. Upon the completion of the final hit, the user's **Speed is raised by one stage** and their **Defense is lowered by one stage**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to modify stats (Speed +1, Defense -1) after the move connects.
* **Targeting:** Single Enemy.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (per hit), Accuracy 90%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Setup-Attacker Hybrid / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Scale Shot is a high-utility move that serves as both a method of damage and a form of "Speed Control." In Generation IX, it became a premier choice for physical attackers when paired with the **Loaded Dice** item, which guarantees 4–5 hits (100–125 Base Power). It is preferred over *Dragon Claw* for its higher ceiling and Speed boost, and over *Outrage* for its lack of a locking effect. As a multi-strike move, it effectively bypasses **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, and abilities like **Multiscale** or **Shadow Shield**.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Multi-strike property; interacts with the Skill Link ability and the Loaded Dice held item.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (97 learners), primarily among Dragon-types and reptilian/aquatic Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Baxcalibur**, **Garchomp**, **Roaring Moon**, and **Kommo-o**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon Pokémon like **Krookodile**, **Gyarados**, and **Sceptile** to provide necessary Speed boosts while maintaining offensive pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Originally introduced as a Move Tutor move in the *Isle of Armor* (Gen VIII), it is now widely available via **TM** in *Scarlet & Violet*.
