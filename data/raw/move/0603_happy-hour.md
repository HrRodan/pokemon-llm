## Identity & Mechanics
**Happy Hour** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user creates a festive atmosphere of celebration and joy. This celebratory aura does not impact the immediate flow of combat but ensures a grander reward once the conflict concludes. It is a signature "Event Move" often associated with special promotional distributions.
* **Effect:** When used, it doubles the amount of prize money received at the end of a Trainer battle. This effect stacks multiplicatively with held items like the **Amulet Coin** or **Luck Incense** (resulting in 4x total prize money). The effect triggers only once per battle and does not stack with itself.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, in Generation VII, when used as a **Z-Move** (Normalium Z), it grants the user a +1 boost to Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed (an "Omniboost").
* **Targeting:** User's side of the field.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Economic Utility / Gimmick Setup.
* **Usage:** In standard competitive play, Happy Hour has zero viability as it provides no tactical advantage. Its primary rival is **Pay Day**, which generates money through damage; Happy Hour is superior for high-stakes Boss or League battles where prize money is already high. In Gen VII "Anything Goes" or niche formats, **Z-Happy Hour** was used as a powerful setup tool to transform a Pokémon into a late-game sweeper. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **No types** (it is a non-damaging Status move).
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypasses accuracy checks. Cannot be reflected by Magic Coat.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is an **Event-Exclusive** move not naturally learned by any Pokémon via level-up.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic event distributions include **Meowth** (often distributed with this move to maximize its money-making theme), **Pikachu**, **Munchlax** (notably the Early Purchase bonus for Pokémon Sun/Moon), and **Jirachi**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** **Smeargle** is the only Pokémon capable of using this move outside of specific events by using **Sketch** to copy it from an event distribution.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It must be obtained through specific mystery gift distributions or inherited via Sketch.
