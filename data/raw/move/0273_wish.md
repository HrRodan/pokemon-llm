## Identity & Mechanics
**Wish** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user makes a heartfelt plea to the heavens, calling upon celestial energy that takes time to manifest. This delayed-action restoration move creates a "healing field" that triggers at the end of the following turn, restoring vitality to whoever is currently active on the user's side of the field.
* **Effect:** At the end of the next turn (the turn after the move is used), the active Pokémon on the user's side is healed for 50% of the **original user's** maximum HP. If the user switches out before the effect triggers, the incoming replacement receives the healing instead.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, the effect fails if the user faints or is forced out by moves like Roar or Whirlwind before the turn ends.
* **Targeting:** Affects the user's position on the field (Self/Replacement).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power —- , Accuracy —- %, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Team Support (specifically "Wish-Passing").
* **Usage:** Wish is the gold standard for **Cleric** and **Support** roles. Unlike *Recover* or *Soft-Boiled*, which provide immediate self-healing, Wish is used to heal teammates that lack their own recovery. It is almost universally paired with **Protect** to ensure the user safely survives the "waiting turn" to receive the heal themselves. Because the healing amount is based on the **user's max HP**, Pokémon with high base HP stats are the most effective "Wish Passers."
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; fails if the user is under the effect of *Heal Block*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (47 learners), primarily concentrated among Fairy, Psychic, and Normal types.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Alomomola:** The premier Wish-passer in modern competitive play due to its massive Base 165 HP, which can nearly fully heal most offensive teammates.
    * **Clefable:** A classic utility user that leverages *Magic Guard* or *Unaware* to safely set up Wishes for the team.
    * **Jirachi:** Often uses Wish alongside *U-turn* to safely pivot a damaged teammate into the incoming heal.
    * **Sylveon / Umbreon:** Popular Eeveelutions that use Wish to maintain their longevity as specially defensive walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on **Scream Tail** and **Chansey** (via event/legacy) to provide team-wide sustain for stall and balance archetypes.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via level-up or Egg Moves; it is rarely available as a TM/TR, making its distribution highly exclusive to specific support-oriented species.
