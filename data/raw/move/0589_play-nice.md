## Identity & Mechanics
**Play Nice** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user initiates a friendly interaction with the target, effectively befriending them to dampen their hostile intent. This non-violent approach causes the opponent to lose their will to fight, resulting in a reduction of their physical offensive capabilities. As a "friendly" move, it is characterized by its inability to miss the target.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s Attack stat by one stage (-1). 
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to reduce Attack.
* **Targeting:** Single Target. Notably, Play Nice is a **bypass-accuracy move**, meaning it will hit even if the user's accuracy has been lowered or the target's evasion has been increased. In certain generations, it even bypasses the protection of moves like *Protect* or *Detect*.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Utility / Defensive Debuff.
* **Usage:** Play Nice is primarily a niche utility move used during the early game or in specific low-tier formats. It is generally considered outclassed by **Charm** (which lowers Attack by two stages) or **Baby-Doll Eyes** (which has +1 Priority). Its primary advantage is its perfect accuracy, making it a reliable way to check physical attackers that rely on Evasion boosts (like *Minimize* or *Double Team*). It deals **neutral utility** to all types, though it is ineffective against Pokémon with the **Clear Body**, **White Smoke**, or **Hyper Cutter** abilities.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; ignores Evasion modifiers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (49 learners), predominantly found among "cute" or "friendly" Pokémon designs.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently seen on **Pikachu/Raichu**, **Audino**, **Jigglypuff**, and the **Hatterene** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by heavy hitters like **Ursaluna (including Bloodmoon)** and **Beartic** as a thematic utility option, though they rarely carry it in high-level competitive play in favor of offensive coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Play Nice is almost exclusively learned via **Level Up**; it is not available as a TM or TR, making its distribution limited to its natural learner set.
