## Identity & Mechanics
**Stun Spore** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user scatters a dense cloud of numbing, orange-colored powder from its spores, petals, or wings. This fine dust coats the opponent, infiltrating their nervous system to induce muscle spasms and significantly hinder movement. As a **Powder-based move**, it is ineffective against Grass-type Pokémon, targets with the Overcoat Ability, or those holding Safety Goggles.
* **Effect:** Inflicts the **Paralysis** status condition on the target. Paralysis reduces the victim's Speed by 50% (since Gen VII) and grants a 25% chance for the target to be "fully paralyzed," preventing them from acting for that turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% effect rate upon hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 75%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Utility / Speed Control.
* **Usage:** Stun Spore serves as a niche **Speed Control** option, primarily used by Grass-types to neutralize faster threats. While it suffers from shaky accuracy (75%) compared to Thunder Wave (90%), it possesses a distinct advantage: it can paralyze **Ground-type Pokémon**, who are naturally immune to Electric-type paralysis moves. This makes it a valuable tool for punishing switches into Ground-type wallbreakers like Great Tusk or Landorus-T.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it does not deal damage. However, it is blocked by **Grass-types**, who are immune to all "Powder" and "Spore" mechanics. 
* **Attributes:** Powder-based move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (54 learners), primarily concentrated among Mushroom-based and floral Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Whimsicott:** Utilizes the **Prankster** ability to fire off priority Stun Spores, effectively shutting down faster sweepers before they can move.
    * **Butterfree:** Often pairs this move with the **Compound Eyes** ability, which boosts the move's accuracy from a risky 75% to a much more reliable 97.5%.
    * **Amoonguss / Breloom:** Frequently carry this as an alternative or supplement to Spore, specifically to catch targets that are already immune to sleep or to provide long-term speed control.
* **Coverage Utility:** Seen on Paradox Pokémon like **Brute Bonnet** and **Slither Wing** to provide utility in the Underused (UU) or Overused (OU) tiers. **Toedscruel** uses it in conjunction with *Mycelium Might* to bypass certain ability-based immunities, though it moves last in its priority bracket.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it is rarely available as a TM/TR in modern generations, making its distribution relatively exclusive to "natural" Grass-types and insectoids.
