## Identity & Mechanics
**Mega Punch** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user winds up a massive amount of physical momentum to deliver a devastating, heavy-handed blow. As a quintessential "tough" move from the Kanto era, it represents raw brawling power, characterized by a glowing fist or a high-velocity impact that rattles the opponent.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no additional effects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Mid-Tier Physical Attacker / Early-Game Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While historically iconic, Mega Punch is often outclassed by **Body Slam** (for its 30% paralysis chance and perfect accuracy) or **Return** (for its higher power and reliability). In competitive formats, its 85% accuracy is considered a significant liability for a move with only 80 base power. However, it is a **Punching Move**, meaning its power is boosted by 20% when used by a Pokémon with the **Iron Fist** ability (reaching an effective 96 base power).
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **Ineffective** against Ghost-types and **Resisted** by Rock and Steel-types. It does not hit any type for Super Effective damage.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact move**, triggering effects like Rough Skin or Rocky Helmet, and is classified as a **Punching move**, making it compatible with the Punching Glove item.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution with **231** different Pokémon capable of learning it, largely due to its status as a legacy TM.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic physical powerhouses like **Snorlax**, **Kangaskhan**, and **Machamp** have historically utilized this move. It is also a signature part of the movepools for **Hitmonchan** and the **Regi** trio (Regirock, Regice, Registeel).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on a variety of non-Normal types like **Charizard**, **Blastoise**, and **Mewtwo**, often as a legacy filler move or for flavor in restricted formats. 
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available via **TM01** in Generation I and made a significant return as **TM00** in Pokémon Sword & Shield. It is also frequently available through Move Tutors in various regions like Hoenn and Kanto.
