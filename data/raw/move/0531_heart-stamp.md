## Identity & Mechanics
**Heart Stamp** is a Physical Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user deceptively lowers the target's guard with a display of cuteness before suddenly delivering a forceful, physical blow. This sudden shift from charm to aggression creates a psychic-infused physical impact designed to catch the opponent off-balance.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to cause the target to **Flinch**, preventing them from moving if the user acts first.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 25 (Max 40).
* **Role:** Niche Physical STAB / Flinch-Hax Utility.
* **Usage:** Heart Stamp is generally considered a low-power option compared to its primary rival, **Zen Headbutt** (80 Power). However, it offers perfect accuracy and a slightly higher flinch rate (30% vs Zen Headbutt's 20%). It is primarily used by physical attackers who lack access to stronger Psychic-type moves or those attempting to "flinch-lock" slower opponents. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, being learned by only 6 Pokémon species.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically associated with **Swoobat** and **Woobat**, who can use it effectively in lower tiers alongside the ability *Simple* or *Klutz*. It is also naturally learned by **Jynx** and **Smoochum**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Miltank** or **Luvdisc** as a flavor-based physical option, though it rarely sees high-level competitive play on these Pokémon due to their superior utility or special-attacking options.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available as a TM or TR; it is strictly acquired via **Level Up** or **Egg Move** inheritance within its limited pool of learners.
