## Identity & Mechanics
**Axe Kick** is a physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user performs a high-reaching acrobatic maneuver, launching itself into the air before slamming its heel downward with crushing force onto the opponent's head. This devastating overhead strike is designed to shatter defenses and disorient the target through sheer concussive impact.
* **Effect:** A high-power attack that carries a significant risk. If the move misses or is negated by an opponent's protection (such as Protect or Detect), the user "crashes" and receives recoil damage equal to 50% of its maximum HP. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Confuse** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Axe Kick serves as a high-reward alternative to *High Jump Kick*. While it has slightly lower base power (120 vs 130), it distinguishes itself with a significant 30% confusion proc, which can provide "free turns" if the opponent survives the initial hit. It is often preferred over *Close Combat* by users who cannot afford the defensive drops, though the 10% miss chance makes it a gamble that can result in an immediate KO for the user. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Flame Body.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (4 total learners in Gen IX).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Hisuian Lilligant:** Utilizes Axe Kick as its primary Fighting-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) to break through Steel and Ice types after a Victory Dance setup.
    * **Lokix:** A common user in competitive tiers that relies on the move’s high base power to threaten Dark and Steel types that resist its Bug-type attacks.
    * **Hitmonlee:** Long-standing kicking specialist that gains this as a thematic power-up.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as a "coverage" move on non-Fighting types; however, **Medicham** uses it to maximize its Pure Power ability, turning the move into a potential one-shot against neutral targets.
* **Acquisition:** It is currently **not available via TM/TR**, restricted entirely to the level-up movepools of its specific learners.
