## Identity & Mechanics
**Flare Blitz** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user surrounds its entire body in an intense, white-hot cloak of combustion before performing a high-velocity, suicidal charge into the target. This maneuver is so volatile that the sheer explosive force of the impact results in significant kickback damage to the user. It is the gold standard for high-output Physical Fire offense, often visualized as a blue or orange-white inferno.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage. The user sustains **1/3 recoil damage** based on the damage dealt to the target. Additionally, if the user is **Frozen**, using Flare Blitz will immediately **thaw** the user, allowing the move to execute successfully.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10%** chance to inflict a **Burn** on the target.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Premium STAB.** It serves as the primary physical offensive tool for Fire-type physical attackers who prioritize raw damage over longevity.
* **Usage:** It is the physical counterpart to *Fire Blast*, offering superior accuracy at the cost of health. In competitive play, it is often paired with items like **Choice Band** for maximum wallbreaking power or used by Pokémon with the **Reckless** ability (to boost power) or **Rock Head** (to negate recoil, though rare for Fire-types). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Iron Barbs*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (101 learners), appearing on almost every fully-evolved physical Fire-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Charizard** (specifically Mega Charizard X), **Blaziken**, **Infernape**, **Incineroar**, and **Cinderace**. It is a staple on **Darmanitan**, which utilizes its massive Attack stat to force switches.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Fire physical threats like **Solrock** or **Koraidon**, and the Paradox Pokémon **Slither Wing** to punish Steel and Bug-type switch-ins. 
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available via **TM/TR** in modern generations (Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet), making it easily accessible for most physical attackers with any thematic link to heat or combustion.
