## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Geyser** is a variable-category Water-type Max Move introduced in **Generation VIII** (Galar region).
* **Description:** This move is a manifestation of immense Dynamax energy, where the user summons a colossal, high-pressure geyser or tidal wave to crush the opponent. The sheer force of the impact saturates the battlefield, causing the sky to darken and unleashing a heavy downpour.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and automatically **summons Rain** (Weather) for five turns (eight if the user holds a Damp Rock). This weather condition boosts the power of Water-type moves by 50% and weakens Fire-type moves.
* **Secondary Effect:** As a Max Move, it **bypasses accuracy checks**, meaning it will never miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig) and the user does not have a way to hit them. It also pierces protection moves (like Protect), dealing 25% of the original damage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 90–150], Accuracy [--]%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Weather-Setting Nuke** / **Offensive Setup**.
* **Usage:** Max Geyser was a cornerstone of the VGC 2020/2021 meta. Its primary value lies in its ability to overwrite opposing weather (like Sand or Sun) while simultaneously buffing the user’s next Water-type attack. It is the offensive equivalent of manually using Rain Dance, but without losing a turn of pressure. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Power is determined by the base move (e.g., Hydro Pump becomes a 150 BP Max Geyser, while Water Pulse becomes a 110 BP Max Geyser). It can be either **Physical or Special** depending on the base move.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Distribution is **Universal** among Pokémon that know at least one Water-type damaging move when they are Dynamaxed.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Gyarados:** Used Max Geyser to set rain, which mitigated its Fire weakness and boosted its STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) attacks while it swept with Max Airstream boosts.
    * **Dracovish:** While usually wanting to stay in base form for Strong Jaw, Dynamaxing for Max Geyser allowed it to set its own rain to ensure *Fishious Rend* became an unstoppable nuke afterward.
    * **Inteleon:** Utilizing its high Special Attack to fire off 140-150 BP Max Geysers to overwhelm neutral targets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Tyranitar** (to surprise Fire-types) or **Dragonite** to clear its own Sandstorm or opposing Sun to benefit from its own Hurricane or Water-type coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Only available through the **Dynamax/Gigantamax** mechanic; it is not a move that can be taught via TM/TR or level-up.
