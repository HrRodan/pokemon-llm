## Identity & Mechanics
**Helping Hand** is a status-class Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user offers words of encouragement or a supportive gesture to an ally, channeling its energy to bolster the power of the partner’s next move. This maneuver is a staple of cooperative combat, designed to turn an ally’s standard attack into a devastating strike through the power of teamwork.
* **Effect:** Boosts the power of the selected ally’s moves by 50% until the end of the turn. This effect occurs even if the ally uses a multi-hit move or a spread move. It cannot be copied by Mirror Move or called by Assist/Metronome.
* **Secondary Effect:** None; however, it possesses a **+5 Priority** bracket, ensuring it almost always executes before any other move in the turn.
* **Targeting:** Single Ally (primarily used in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [N/A], Accuracy [N/A], PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Offensive Support / Force Multiplier.
* **Usage:** Helping Hand is a cornerstone of VGC and Doubles formats. Its high priority (+5) allows it to outspeed even extreme priority moves like Extreme Speed or Fake Out, ensuring the ally receives the buff before they act. It is used to turn "near-KOs" into guaranteed **Nukes**, allowing a partner to break through defensive walls or ignore the damage reduction of spread moves like Rock Slide or Dazzling Gleam. It is particularly effective for Pokémon that lack offensive presence themselves but want to contribute to a **Wallbreaking** strategy.
* **Attributes:** Priority Move; ignores "Follow Me" or "Rage Powder" redirection because it targets an ally.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution (669 learners), making it one of the most accessible support moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic support-oriented Pokémon such as **Cresselia**, **Clefable**, and the **Eeveelutions** (particularly **Sylveon** and **Umbreon**) frequently utilize this move to enhance their offensive partners.
* **VGC Staples:** High-tier competitive threats like **Incineroar**, **Ogerpon**, and **Whimsicott** often carry Helping Hand to provide immediate offensive pressure without needing to spend a turn attacking themselves.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available as a **TM** (Technical Machine) in nearly every generation since its debut, allowing a massive variety of Pokémon to adopt a supportive role.
