## Identity & Mechanics
**Oblivion Wing** is a Special Flying-type Signature Move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user unfurls its wings to radiate a sinister, life-leaching energy that consumes the target’s vitality. As the target is struck by this dark, avian power, their life force is siphoned back into the user, revitalizing them instantly. This move serves as the thematic counterpart to Xerneas's life-giving powers, representing the destructive and regenerative cycle of Yveltal.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and restores the user's HP by **75%** of the damage dealt. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Recovery is a primary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Sustained Wallbreaker / Offensive Recovery.
* **Usage:** Oblivion Wing is one of the most potent recovery moves in the game. Unlike standard draining moves (like Giga Drain or Drain Punch) which heal for 50%, Oblivion Wing heals for a massive **75%**. This allows a Pokémon to stay healthy while maintaining offensive pressure. It is often paired with a **Life Orb** or **Metronome** to maximize damage and subsequent healing. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, projectile-based move. It is boosted by the **Big Root** item (increasing healing to 97.5% of damage dealt).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (1 learner), functioning as a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Legendary Pokémon **Yveltal**. It is the cornerstone of Yveltal's viability in the Ubers tier, allowing it to act as a "bulky pivot" or a "Dynamax Sweeper" (in Gen 8) that is incredibly difficult to wear down.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Yveltal, it is primarily used for **STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus)**. On Yveltal, it provides essential neutral coverage against most of the meta, forcing switches against Pokémon like Marshadow or Calyrex-Shadow.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned only by Yveltal upon reaching Level 1 (relearned) or Level 44.
