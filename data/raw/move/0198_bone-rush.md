## Identity & Mechanics
**Bone Rush** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user brandishes a hard bone like a staff or club, striking the target with a flurry of rapid-fire blows. This move is characterized by its rhythmic, multi-hit execution, where the user pummels the opponent between two and five times in a single turn. This makes it particularly effective at dismantling defensive layers that rely on single-hit protection.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage 2–5 times per use. It has a 37.5% chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit 4 or 5 times, averaging 3 hits per turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Each hit can independently trigger effects like King's Rock flinch or break through **Substitutes** and **Focus Sashes**).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (Per hit), Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Multi-hit Physical Attacker / Utility Breaker.
* **Usage:** While less reliable than **Earthquake** or **High Horsepower** due to its 90% accuracy and variable hit count, Bone Rush serves as a specialized niche move. Its primary competitive value lies in its ability to bypass **Sturdy**, **Focus Sashes**, and **Multiscale**, as well as destroying a **Substitute** and continuing to deal damage to the target. In later generations, it synergizes exceptionally well with the **Loaded Dice** item, guaranteeing 4–5 hits. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock,** and **Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a physical attack involving a bone, Bone Rush is a **non-contact** move in most generations, allowing the user to avoid chip damage from abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (7 total learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon associated with bone-wielding or specialized martial arts.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Marowak** (including Alolan form) and **Cubone** lines. It is also a signature flavor move for **Lucario**, representing its ability to manifest aura-based weaponry. 
* **Coverage Utility:** **Mandibuzz** is a rare non-Ground/Fighting type that learns the move, occasionally utilizing it in niche sets to provide physical Ground coverage against Steel or Electric types that expect a purely defensive flyer.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it has never been available as a **TM or TR**, making it a "natural" move for those within its specific evolutionary families.
