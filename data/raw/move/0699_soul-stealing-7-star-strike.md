## Identity & Mechanics
**Soul-Stealing 7-Star Strike** is a physical Ghost-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** Harnessing the immense energy of Z-Power, the user—specifically Marshadow—surrounds itself in a spectral aura before unleashing a relentless barrage of seven consecutive punches and kicks. The cinematic attack culminates in a powerful explosive finish that overwhelms the target's spirit. This move is the signature Z-Move of the Mythical Pokémon Marshadow.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive physical damage. As a Z-Move, it bypasses the accuracy check and cannot be evaded under normal circumstances.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 195, Accuracy --%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Powered Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** This move serves as one of the most powerful offensive tools in the game, specifically designed to secure a One-Hit KO (OHKO) on bulky threats. It is the upgraded version of Marshadow's signature move, **Spectral Thief**, requiring the **Marshadium Z** crystal. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. Because it is a Z-Move, it pierces through protection moves like Protect or Detect, though it deals reduced damage (25%) in those instances.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** This move is **exclusive to Marshadow**. No other Pokémon can utilize this Z-Move, as it requires both the specific held item (Marshadium Z) and the move Spectral Thief to be known.
* **Coverage Utility:** While Marshadow is its only user, the move is legendary in competitive tiers (like Smogon's Ubers) for its ability to delete nearly any Pokémon that does not resist Ghost-type attacks, especially after Marshadow has stolen the opponent's stat boosts with Spectral Thief.
* **Acquisition:** Only accessible in Generation VII games through an event-distributed Marshadow holding its signature Z-Crystal. It is unavailable in subsequent generations where the Z-Move mechanic was removed.
