## Identity & Mechanics
**Barrage** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user hurls a rapid succession of round objects—often depicted as seeds, orbs, or egg-like projectiles—at the target. This multi-hit attack pummels the opponent with repetitive kinetic force, making it visually distinct as a "bombardment" style move.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage 2–5 times in a single turn. It has a 37.5% chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% chance to hit 4 or 5 times. This allows the move to break through **Focus Sashes**, the **Sturdy** ability, and **Substitutes**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15 (per hit), Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Multi-hit Signature Move / Niche Utility.
* **Usage:** Historically, Barrage is a low-impact move due to its low base power (averaging 45 BP) and shaky accuracy. It is significantly outclassed by other multi-hit moves like *Tail Slap* or *Icicle Spear*. In competitive play, it is rarely seen because its primary users are Special Attackers, while Barrage calculates damage using the Physical Attack stat. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **No types** (Normal-type moves have no offensive advantages).
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a **Bullet move**, meaning it is blocked by the **Bulletproof** ability. 

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (3 total learners), functioning as a signature move for a specific evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Exeggcute**, **Exeggutor**, and **Alolan Exeggutor**.
* **Coverage Utility:** None. Because it is not available via TM, HM, or Move Tutor, it is never seen as a coverage option on non-grass/psychic types.
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM/TR**; it can only be learned through leveling up by its specific evolutionary family. In many later generations, it was eventually removed from active movepools or marked as "unusable."
