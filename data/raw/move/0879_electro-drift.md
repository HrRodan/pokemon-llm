**## Identity & Mechanics**
**Electro-drift** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The user transforms into a high-speed, futuristic vehicle or jet-like state, racing forward at ultrafast speeds to pierce the target with high-voltage, neon electricity. The move represents a fusion of kinetic energy and advanced technology, manifesting as a piercing strike that utilizes the user's momentum to maximize electrical discharge.
* **Effect:** Deals damage. This move’s damage is increased by **33.3% (1.33x)** if it deals super effective damage to the target. This stacks with standard type-effectiveness multipliers and STAB.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

**## Competitive Profile**
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Signature Wallbreaker / Elite STAB.**
* **Usage:** Electro-drift is the premier offensive tool for Miraidon. While its base 100 power is comparable to *Thunderbolt* (90) or *Thunder* (110), its unique "Super Effective" multiplier makes it significantly more lethal against Water and Flying types. When combined with Miraidon's **Hadron Engine** ability (which sets Electric Terrain and boosts Special Attack), this move becomes one of the hardest-hitting attacks in the game, often securing OHKOs on bulky neutral targets. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is **not** a contact move; it is a Special projectile/energy attack, bypassing items like Rocky Helmet or abilities like Rough Skin.

**## Distribution & Notable Users**
It has a **very narrow** distribution (5 forms of the same Pokémon), acting as a unique signature move.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Miraidon** (including its Drive, Aquatic, Glide, and Low-Power modes).
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not used for coverage by other Pokémon. However, it is the cornerstone of Miraidon’s kit, allowing it to brute-force through resistances.
* **Acquisition:** This move is obtained via leveling up Miraidon; it is **not available** via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other Pokémon.
