## Identity & Mechanics
**Aurora Beam** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user discharges a brilliant, rainbow-colored beam of iridescent light and freezing energy at the target. This shimmering ray of cold not only deals damage but also has a chilling effect that can sap the target's physical strength, making it a "beam" category move visually associated with the aurora borealis.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a 10% chance to lower the target’s Attack stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 65, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Early-to-Mid Game STAB / Progression Move.
* **Usage:** In competitive play, Aurora Beam is almost strictly outclassed by **Ice Beam** (90 Power) and **Blizzard** (110 Power). Its primary niche is during the leveling process or in "Lower Tier" formats where higher-powered TMs are restricted. The 10% Attack drop is a welcome defensive bonus but occurs too infrequently to rely on for strategy. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Flying, Ground, Grass,** and **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact, special projectile. While it is a "beam" move, it does not currently receive specific boosts from abilities like Mega Launcher (which affects Pulse/Aura moves).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (33 total learners), primarily concentrated among Water-type and Ice-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Ice and Water types such as **Lapras**, **Cloyster**, **Dewgong**, and **Aurorus** learn this naturally. It is a signature thematic move for the **Amaura** line.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Ice types like **Vaporeon**, **Suicune**, and the legendary **Cresselia** as a natural level-up option for hitting Dragon and Flying types before they have access to TM-based Ice coverage.
* **Acquisition:** Aurora Beam is almost exclusively a **Level-Up move**. It has historically lacked a TM or TR designation in most generations, making its distribution limited to those who learn it naturally or via Egg Moves.
