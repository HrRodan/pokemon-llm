## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Shed** is a Status Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically within the Orre Region titles (*Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*).
* **Description:** The user radiates a wave of dark, chaotic energy that unravels spiritual and psychic constructs. This shadowy aura permeates the entire battlefield, forcibly dissolving protective barriers and neutralizing defensive field effects to leave opponents vulnerable.
* **Effect:** Removes the effects of **Light Screen**, **Reflect**, and **Safeguard** from the field. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (Affects both the player's and the opponent's side).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP — (Infinite/Niche).
* **Role:** Field Utility / Barrier Breaker.
* **Usage:** In its native environment (*Pokémon XD*), Shadow Shed serves as a specialized **Utility** move designed to counter "Dual Screens" strategies. It is the Shadow-type precursor to the modern utility of *Defog* or the screen-breaking property of *Brick Break*. While it lacks offensive pressure, its ability to bypass accuracy makes it a guaranteed way to reset the defensive state of a match.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Shadow move, it exists outside the standard type chart but is most effective at neutralizing **Psychic-type** defensive utility (Light Screen/Reflect).
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; categorized as a Shadow move (exclusive to non-purified Pokémon).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, limited strictly to **Shadow Pokémon** within the Orre region.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably found on **Shadow Moltres**, **Shadow Exeggutor**, and **Shadow Farfetch'd** during the events of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Since Shadow moves are exclusive to "Shadow" versions of Pokémon, this move is used primarily as a niche support option to prevent opponents from stalling out the player’s offensive Shadow moves.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be learned via TM, TR, or Breeding. It is part of a fixed "Shadow Move" set and is **permanently lost** once the Pokémon undergoes Purification, usually being replaced by a standard move from the Pokémon's natural level-up pool.
