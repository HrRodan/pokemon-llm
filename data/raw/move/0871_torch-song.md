## Identity & Mechanics
**Torch Song** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user exhales a torrent of rhythmic, raging flames that resonate with the intensity of a musical performance. This searing melody envelops the target in thermal energy while the user’s own spirit and focus are amplified by the performance. As a **Sound-based** move, it bypasses the effects of *Substitute*, making it impossible for targets to hide behind a decoy.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the user's Special Attack stat by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to raise the user's Special Attack.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Snowball Sweeper.
* **Usage:** Torch Song is widely considered one of the most powerful offensive utility moves in the game. Unlike *Fiery Dance*, which only has a 50% chance to boost stats, Torch Song provides a **guaranteed +1 Sp. Atk** every time it successfully hits. This allows the user to pressure the opponent while simultaneously setting up a sweep. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move. It is blocked by the *Soundproof* ability but ignores *Substitute*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Skeledirge**, the final evolution of the Paldean Fire starter, Fuecoco.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to Skeledirge, it is synonymous with the Pokémon's identity as a bulky, **Unaware** wallbreaker. It allows Skeledirge to bypass opponent stat changes while rapidly increasing its own offensive pressure.
* **Acquisition:** Currently unavailable via TM/TR; it is learned naturally through evolution/level-up by its signature user.
