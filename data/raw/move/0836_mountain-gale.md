## Identity & Mechanics
**Mountain Gale** is a physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Legends: Arceus).
* **Description:** The user conjures and hurls massive, jagged blocks of glacial ice or tectonic fragments at the target. This move represents the raw, crushing power of mountain-dwelling behemoths, utilizing freezing temperatures and sheer kinetic force to overwhelm opponents.
* **Effect:** Deals direct physical damage. In standard battle formats (Gen IX onwards), it possesses a significant secondary effect.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to cause the target to **Flinch**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 85%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Physical Nuke** / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Mountain Gale serves as a higher-power, lower-accuracy alternative to *Icicle Crash*. While it offers a substantial 100 Base Power, the 85% accuracy makes it a "high-variance" move that can decide games based on a miss. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types, making it an elite offensive tool against many of the tier's most dangerous threats.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move, meaning the user does not trigger abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **extremely narrow** distribution, acting as a signature move (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Currently, the move is the signature transition for **Hisuian Avalugg**. On Hisuian Avalugg, this move benefits from **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus), turning it into a terrifying 150-power nuke that can potentially "flinch-lock" slower defensive walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its exclusive nature, it is not currently seen as coverage on other Pokémon. It defines the offensive niche of Hisuian Avalugg, allowing it to threaten OHKOs on bulky Ground and Dragon types that other physical attackers might struggle to break.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it is learned naturally through leveling up by its specific user.
