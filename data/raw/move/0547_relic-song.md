## Identity & Mechanics
**Relic Song** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user vocalizes a haunting, mystical melody that resonates with the ancient spirits and hearts of those listening. This melodic wave radiates outward, striking multiple foes with ethereal energy. Because it is a song-based attack, it bypasses the effects of **Substitute**, though it is negated by the **Soundproof** ability.
* **Effect:** Deals damage to all adjacent opponents. If the user is **Meloetta**, using this move causes it to transform: it toggles between its **Aria Forme** (Normal/Psychic) and its **Pirouette Forme** (Normal/Fighting). The transformation occurs immediately after the move is used.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to induce the **Sleep** status condition on the target(s).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Form-Changing Utility / Spread STAB.
* **Usage:** Relic Song is unique as it is the only method for Meloetta to access its high-Speed, high-Attack **Pirouette Forme** during battle. While its base power is modest, its ability to hit both opponents in Doubles and bypass Substitutes makes it a tactical tool. It is often used to catch opponents off-guard by pivoting from a Special Wallbreaker (Aria) to a Physical Sweeper (Pirouette). It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and has no effect on **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (Bypasses Substitute; blocked by Soundproof).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being a **Signature Move** (2 learners total, both being forms of the same Pokémon).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Meloetta (Aria Forme)** and **Meloetta (Pirouette Forme)**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is never seen on non-Normal-type Pokémon as it cannot be learned via TM, HM, or Breeding; it is typically learned via a special Move Tutor in various regions (such as Castelia City in Unova).
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; requires a specific **Move Tutor** (historically an NPC who teaches the move upon seeing a Meloetta in the player's party).
