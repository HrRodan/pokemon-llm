## Identity & Mechanics
**Assurance** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user waits for the optimal moment to strike, capitalizing on the target’s existing injuries to deliver a crushing blow. Visually, the user pounces or strikes immediately after the opponent has been staggered by another source of damage, effectively doubling its impact. This move is highly synergistic with entry hazards, status conditions, and multi-battle partner attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. If the target has already taken damage from any source (including attacks, entry hazards like Stealth Rock, or status damage like Burn/Poison) earlier in the same turn, the base power of the move doubles from 60 to 120.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (120 if triggered), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Doubles Tech.
* **Usage:** While outclassed in Singles by the utility of *Knock Off* or the consistency of *Crunch*, Assurance is a premier choice in **Double Battles**. Because a faster teammate can trigger the "damage taken" condition, Assurance effectively becomes a 120 BP Dark-type move with no drawbacks. It is particularly effective for punishing targets after they have been chipped by spread moves like *Rock Slide* or *Dazzling Gleam*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes contact. Affected by *Tough Claws* and *Iron Fist* (if the user has these abilities).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (212 learners), making it a common sight on many physical attackers across different tiers.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Tyranitar**, **Incineroar**, and **Kingambit**, all of whom benefit from the move's massive power ceiling in VGC/Doubles formats. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Aerodactyl**, **Zacian-Crowned**, and **Galarian Zapdos** to provide reliable Dark-type coverage for hitting Ghost-type walls.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in modern generations, particularly in Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet, ensuring most physical bruisers have access to it.
