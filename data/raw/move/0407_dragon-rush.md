## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Rush** is a physical Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user shrouds itself in a terrifying, dark draconic aura and tackles the target with overwhelming menace and force. This intimidating display of power is designed to shatter the opponent's resolve, potentially causing them to hesitate in battle.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage. If the target has used Minimize, this move bypasses accuracy checks and deals double damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to make the target flinch.
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 75%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** High-Risk Wallbreaker / Nuke.
* **Usage:** Dragon Rush is often considered a middle-ground option between the reliable but weaker **Dragon Claw** (80 BP) and the high-commitment **Outrage** (120 BP). Its main drawback is its 75% accuracy, which makes it unreliable in high-stakes competitive play unless paired with accuracy-boosting items like **Wide Lens** or setup moves like **Hone Claws**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (42 learners), primarily found among draconic Pokémon and those with "menacing" physical builds.
* **Prominent Users:** It is an iconic move for **Garchomp**, **Dragonite**, and **Roaring Moon**, who can utilize their high Attack stats to capitalize on the 100 base power.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on heavy-hitting non-Dragon types like **Rhyperior** and **Charizard** to provide high-neutral damage or to hit opposing Dragon-type threats on the switch.
* **Acquisition:** While primarily learned through leveling up for many Dragon-types, it has appeared as a **TM** (Technical Machine) or **TR** (Technical Record) in various generations, though its availability fluctuates by game.
