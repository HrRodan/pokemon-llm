## Identity & Mechanics
**Bubble** is a Special Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user exhales or sprays a flurry of delicate, iridescent bubbles at the opposition. These bubbles burst upon impact, dousing the target in a light aquatic foam that creates a slippery environment and obscures their movement.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to all adjacent opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to lower the target’s Speed stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread damage in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Spread Utility.
* **Usage:** Primarily serves as a foundational move for young Water-type Pokémon. While it offers higher utility than *Water Gun* due to its Speed-drop chance and multi-target capability, it is almost universally replaced by **Bubble Beam** or **Surf** once the Pokémon reaches higher levels. In competitive "Little Cup" or early-game scenarios, it functions as a reliable way to chip away at multiple foes. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by King's Rock (it has its own flinch-independent effect).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among aquatic and semi-aquatic species (65 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized as a starting move by Water-type starters such as **Squirtle**, **Piplup**, and **Froakie**. It is also a signature early-game move for **Poliwag** and **Tentacool**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Goomy** and **Goodra**, providing these Dragon-types with early-game elemental coverage to deal with Ground or Rock threats.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned through natural leveling; it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, as it is considered a basic "nursery" move.
