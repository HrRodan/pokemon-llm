## Identity & Mechanics
**Raging Bull** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user lowers its head and charges with the ferocity of a stampeding bull, delivering a devastating tackle. This move is unique in its adaptability; its elemental type shifts to match the specific form of the user, and the sheer force of the impact is capable of shattering defensive constructs. It is a vital tool for bypassing opponent mitigation.
* **Effect:** This move’s type changes depending on the user’s form (Normal, Fighting, Fire, or Water). Additionally, it destroys **Light Screen**, **Reflect**, and **Aurora Veil** on the target's side of the field before dealing damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to break barriers).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Reliable STAB** / **Utility Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Raging Bull serves as the signature move for the Tauros family. It is strictly superior to **Brick Break** (75 Power) for breaking screens due to its higher base power. Unlike **Close Combat**, it provides a consistent Fighting-type STAB (on Paldean forms) without the penalty of lowering the user's defensive stats, making it an excellent choice for bulky offensive sets. It deals **Super Effective** damage based on the user's form:
    * **Combat Breed:** Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, Dark.
    * **Blaze Breed:** Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel.
    * **Aqua Breed:** Fire, Ground, Rock.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, as it is the signature move of the Tauros lineage (4 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Paldean Tauros (Blaze Breed)** and **Paldean Tauros (Aqua Breed)**, who use it as their primary STAB and a way to punishes "Screens" teams (Hyper Offense). It is also used by **Paldean Tauros (Combat Breed)** and the original **Kanto Tauros**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because this move is a signature ability that changes type based on the user's form, it is not used for "coverage" in the traditional sense, but rather defines the offensive profile of the Pokémon using it.
* **Acquisition:** Level-up only; it is not available via TM or TR.
