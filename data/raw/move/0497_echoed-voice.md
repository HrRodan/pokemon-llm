## Identity & Mechanics
**Echoed Voice** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a resonant, harmonic cry that reverberates throughout the battlefield. As a sound-based move, it bypasses the target's **Substitute**. The sonic vibrations intensify with each successive use, creating a mounting wall of sound that becomes increasingly difficult to endure.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and tracks consecutive uses. If any friendly Pokémon uses this move on consecutive turns, its base power increases by 40 each time (40, 80, 120, 160), reaching a maximum **Base Power of 200**. The chain is broken if the move is not used for one turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power amplification is the primary mechanic).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40 (Scalable), Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Ramp-up Sweeper / Momentum Builder.
* **Usage:** While initially weaker than **Hyper Voice**, Echoed Voice serves as a niche "Special Power-up Punch" for sound-themed teams. In Singles, it is often too slow to reach its 200 BP peak before the user is forced out. However, in Doubles, two Pokémon can "stack" the echoes to reach maximum power in just two turns. It is strictly outclassed by **Boomburst** on Pokémon that have access to both, but remains a viable **Consistency Option** for long-form battles.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types. It cannot hit **Ghost** types unless the user has the **Scrappy** ability.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Sound-based** move; it is blocked by the **Soundproof** ability but ignores **Substitute**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (270 learners), being a staple TM move across several generations.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic sound-themed Pokémon such as **Exploud**, **Chatot**, and **Wigglytuff** utilize this for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). **Sylveon** and **Gardevoir** can use this effectively if they possess the **Pixilate** ability, converting the move into a scaling Fairy-type nuke.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Mega Altaria** or **Aurorus** (via **Refrigerate**) to transform the scaling damage into type-specific coverage that pierces Substitutes.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM49** (Gen V–VI) and **TM76** (Gen VII), making it accessible to a massive variety of Special Attackers.
