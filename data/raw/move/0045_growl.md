## Identity & Mechanics
**Growl** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lets out a cute or menacing growl to reduce the target's fighting spirit. As a **Sound-based** move, it carries the unique property of bypassing a target's *Substitute* in modern generations (Gen VI+), making it a subtle way to debuff enemies behind cover.
* **Effect:** Decreases the Attack stat of all adjacent opponents by one stage (-1). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double and Triple battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP 40 (Max 64).
* **Role:** Early-game Utility / Niche Double Battle Support.
* **Usage:** In competitive Singles, Growl is almost entirely outclassed by the ability **Intimidate**, which applies the same debuff upon entry without wasting a turn. However, in low-level play or specific Nuzlocke scenarios, it provides essential damage mitigation against Physical attackers. In Doubles, its ability to hit multiple targets simultaneously gives it a minor niche over single-target moves like *Charm*, though it is still generally bypassed for more impactful status moves like *Will-O-Wisp*.
* **Attributes:** **Sound-based** (blocked by the *Soundproof* ability). Does not make contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (**249 learners**), primarily consisting of Pokémon in their unevolved or "baby" stages.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic starters and mascots including **Pikachu**, **Bulbasaur**, **Eevee**, and **Charmander** all carry this as a starting move.
* **Evolutionary Retainment:** Many fully evolved threats like **Charizard**, **Venusaur**, and **Sylveon** retain the move, though they rarely occupy a move slot with it in high-level play.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a "coverage" move in the traditional damage sense, it is found on a massive variety of archetypes, from Dragon-types like **Naganadel** to defensive walls like **Blissey**.
* **Acquisition:** Growl is almost exclusively a **starting move** (Level 1) or learned at very low levels (Level 3-5). It is virtually never available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor, making it a "natural" trait of the Pokémon's early life.
