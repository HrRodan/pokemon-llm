## Identity & Mechanics
**Lovely Kiss** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto region).
* **Description:** The user approaches the target with an endearing or romantic gesture and plants a kiss that induces a heavy, immediate slumber. This move leverages the user's charm to incapacitate the foe, leaving them vulnerable and unable to act for several turns.
* **Effect:** Puts the target to sleep.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (100% chance to inflict the Sleep status condition upon a successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 75%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Disruption / Utility.**
* **Usage:** Lovely Kiss is a high-stakes status move used to neutralize a "Check" or force a switch. With 75% accuracy, it is significantly more reliable than *Sing* (55%) and *Grass Whistle* (55%). While it lacks the perfect accuracy of *Spore*, it has a distinct advantage over *Sleep Powder* because it is **not a powder-based move**, meaning it can bypass the immunities of Grass-type Pokémon, the Overcoat ability, and the Safety Goggles item.
* **Type Matchups:** As a status move, it bypasses traditional type resistances, though as a Normal-type move in later generations, it is subject to standard status-blocking mechanics like *Magic Coat* or *Magic Bounce*.
* **Attributes:** Contact (historically associated with physical proximity, though categorized as Status).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Jynx** and its pre-evolution **Smoochum**. 
* **Competitive Niche:** In competitive play (particularly in lower tiers like NU or ZU), **Jynx** uses Lovely Kiss as a "Nuke" for momentum; by putting a counter to sleep, Jynx can safely use *Nasty Plot* to sweep or *Substitute* to hide from faster attackers. 
* **Acquisition:** This move is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is learned strictly through leveling up within the Jynx evolutionary line, making it one of the rarest status-inducing moves in the franchise.
