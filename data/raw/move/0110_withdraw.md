## Identity & Mechanics
**Withdraw** is a Status Water-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The Pokémon retracts its body into its hard shell or protective covering, minimizing its exposure to attacks to bolster its physical resilience. This move is synonymous with shell-bound organisms and serves as a fundamental defensive maneuver to mitigate physical damage.
* **Effect:** Raises the user’s Defense stat by one stage (+1). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 40 (Max 64).
* **Role:** Defensive Setup.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Withdraw is generally considered a **sub-optimal setup move**. It is strictly outclassed by **Iron Defense** and **Acid Armor**, both of which raise the Defense stat by two stages (+2) in a single turn. It is primarily used in the early-game of a playthrough or by Pokémon with highly restricted movepools. Because it is a Water-type move, it interacts with certain mechanics like *Prankster* or *Type-changing* abilities, though it does not deal damage and thus ignores type-effectiveness.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses accuracy checks (cannot miss).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow, thematic distribution (39 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with shells, carapaces, or protective vessels.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic "Shell" Pokémon such as **Blastoise**, **Cloyster**, **Torterra**, and **Shuckle** learn this naturally.
* **Thematic Distribution:** It is frequently found on "Hard Shell" archetypes, including **Torkoal**, **Carracosta**, and **Crustle**, reinforcing their identity as physical walls.
* **Unique Learners:** Interestingly, the move is found on non-aquatic "vessel" Pokémon like **Polteageist** (hiding in its teapot) and the Legendary Pokémon **Terapagos**.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned via **Level-up**. It is rarely featured as a TM or TR, limiting its availability to its natural learning list.
