## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Rave** is a Special Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically appearing in *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user manifests a surge of corrupted, dark energy that erupts from the ground or emanates in a wide wave to strike multiple foes. As a Shadow move, it represents the heart of a Pokémon being closed by artificial means, resulting in a chaotic discharge of power that ignores traditional elemental resistances.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with no secondary status effects. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Opponents-field (Hits all adjacent opponents in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP [N/A] (Shadow moves do not utilize standard PP).
* **Role:** Spread Damage / Shadow Coverage.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, Shadow moves are unique because they are **Super Effective** against all non-Shadow Pokémon and "Not Very Effective" against other Shadow Pokémon. Shadow Rave serves as a reliable, mid-power spread option, allowing the user to pressure both opponents simultaneously without hitting their teammate. It is the Shadow-type equivalent of moves like *Swift* or *Heat Wave*, but with the specialized "Super Effective against everything" property of the Shadow type.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is unaffected by most standard ability-based protections like *Bulletproof* or *Soundproof*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution, limited strictly to "Shadow Pokémon" encountered during the Orre region crisis.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Shadow Salamence**, **Shadow Marowak**, **Shadow Swellow**, and **Shadow Electabuzz**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Unlike standard moves, Shadow Rave cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor; it is a temporary "locked" move that a Shadow Pokémon possesses until it undergoes purification. It is used exclusively to counter non-Shadow threats during the main story of *Pokémon XD*.
* **Acquisition:** Only available on specific Shadow Pokémon caught from Cipher members; it disappears once the Pokémon's heart is fully opened and it is purified.
