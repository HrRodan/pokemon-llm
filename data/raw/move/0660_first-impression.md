## Identity & Mechanics
**First Impression** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user lunges at the target with overwhelming speed and force the moment it enters the fray. This move is designed to catch opponents off guard, delivering a massive blow before they can react. Because it relies on the element of surprise, it can only be successfully executed on the very first turn the user is active on the field.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage with a **+2 Priority** bracket. It fails if used on any turn other than the user's first turn out (similar to Fake Out).
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Priority Nuke** / **Revenge Killer** / **Hit-and-Run Pivot**.
* **Usage:** First Impression is a premier revenge-killing tool. With a +2 priority, it outspeeds standard priority moves like Sucker Punch, Water Shuriken, and Mach Punch (which are +1). It is most effective when paired with switching moves like **U-turn** or items like **Eject Button**, allowing the user to reset the "first turn" condition. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Unlike Fake Out, it does not cause flinching, but its significantly higher base power makes it a lethal threat to frail offensive threats.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution (13 total learners), primarily limited to Bug-types and select aggressive physical attackers.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Golisopod:** Its semi-signature move; synergizes perfectly with the **Emergency Exit** ability to reset the move's availability.
    * **Lokix:** A terrifying threat in competitive play due to the **Tinted Lens** ability, which allows First Impression to hit resisted types for neutral damage.
    * **Slither Wing:** A Paradox Pokémon that uses its massive Attack stat to force switches or KO faster threats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Flygon** or **Sirfetch'd** to provide high-priority utility that compensates for their middling Speed tiers.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it is **not available via TM/TR** and is typically learned via Level Up or as an Egg Move, making it a rare and specialized tool in a team's kit.
