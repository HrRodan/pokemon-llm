## Identity & Mechanics
**Grassy Terrain** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation VI.
* **Description:** The user summons a lush, verdant overgrowth that carpets the battlefield in thick grass for five turns. This environmental shift nourishes grounded combatants, surrounding them in restorative energy while channeling the power of nature to empower Grass-type techniques.
* **Effect:** For five turns, all grounded Pokémon (those not Flying-type or possessing Levitate) recover 1/16 of their maximum HP at the end of each turn. Additionally, the power of Grass-type moves used by grounded Pokémon is increased by 50% (1.5x). This move also modifies specific mechanics: **Nature Power** becomes Energy Ball, **Secret Power** has a chance to cause sleep, and **Camouflage** changes the user to a Grass-type.
* **Secondary Effect:** Crucially, Grassy Terrain halves the damage taken from the moves **Earthquake**, **Magnitude**, and **Bulldoze**.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (Affects all active Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility / Field Control / Defensive Support.
* **Usage:** While rarely manually clicked in high-level play due to the prevalence of the Ability **Grassy Surge**, the move provides essential team-wide recovery and neuters one of the most common physical moves in the game: Earthquake. It is often paired with the **Terrain Extender** item to increase duration to eight turns. It deals **Super Effective** damage contextually by boosting Grass moves against **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; does not make contact; non-protectable (field effect).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (126 learners), primarily consisting of Grass-type Pokémon and mystical/fairy-like entities.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly associated with **Rillaboom**, **Tapu Bulu**, and **Venusaur**. While Rillaboom and Tapu Bulu often set it via Ability, they can manually reset it with the move to win "Terrain Wars" against other Surge users.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by Pokémon like **Florges**, **Comfey**, and **Arboliva** to provide passive recovery for teammates and to enable the "Grassy Seed" held item, which boosts Defense upon entering this terrain.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as a **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it accessible to almost every fully evolved Grass-type.
