## Identity & Mechanics
**Mud-Slap** is a Special Ground-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user hurls a concentrated glob of mud directly at the target's face. This maneuver not only deals minor damage but also physically obscures the opponent's vision, making it significantly harder for them to land subsequent attacks.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and is guaranteed to lower the target's Accuracy by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower Accuracy.
* **Targeting:** Selected target (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 20, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility Chip / Evasion Support.
* **Usage:** While its damage output is negligible, Mud-Slap serves as a niche utility tool. Unlike *Sand Attack*, Mud-Slap deals damage, meaning it is not blocked by *Taunt*. It is primarily used in lower-tier play or "gimmick" sets to force switches by making the opponent's moves unreliable. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by King's Rock-like flinch boosts due to its guaranteed secondary effect.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an exceptionally wide distribution, with **503** Pokémon capable of learning it, largely due to its status as a frequent TM and Move Tutor option.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Swampert**, **Gastrodon**, and **Mudsdale**, who utilize it thematically or as a nuisance tool in early-game progression.
* **Coverage Utility:** Surprisingly common on non-Ground types like **Charizard**, **Lucario**, and **Greninja**. These Pokémon may use it in specific metagames to punish Physical attackers or to chip away at Focus Sashes while simultaneously debuffing the foe.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM31** in Generation II and returning as a craftable **TM005** in Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet).
