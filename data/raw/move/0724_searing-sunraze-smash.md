## Identity & Mechanics
**Searing Sunraze Smash** is a Physical Steel-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon / Ultra Sun & Ultra Moon).
* **Description:** After obtaining Z-Power from a Solganium Z, the user—typically the emissary of the sun, Solgaleo—leaps into an ultra-wormhole, gathers immense solar energy, and charges at the target with the force of a collapsing star. This radiant, interdimensional tackle is designed to incinerate any defensive measures the opponent attempts to employ.
* **Effect:** This move deals massive damage and possesses a "Mold Breaker" property, meaning it ignores the effects of the target's Ability that could hinder or weaken the attack.
* **Secondary Effect:** It specifically bypasses and breaks through the **Disguise** ability (Mimikyu) and ignores damage-reduction abilities like **Multiscale** (Dragonite/Lugia) or **Sturdy**.
* **Targeting:** Selected single-target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 200, Accuracy —% (Never-miss), PP 1 (Z-Move).
* **Role:** Single-Use Ultimate Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** As a signature Z-Move, it is used to delete a specific threat that would otherwise wall the user. Unlike standard Steel moves, its ability-ignoring property makes it the ultimate counter to defensive staples. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy, Ice, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a Z-Move upgrade of **Sunsteel Strike**. It does not make contact in the traditional sense of triggering items like Rocky Helmet, as it is a cinematic Z-attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it requires a specific Z-Crystal (Solganium Z) and a specific base move (Sunsteel Strike).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Solgaleo** and **Dusk Mane Necrozma**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it requires the legendary-exclusive move Sunsteel Strike, it is never seen as "coverage" on other Pokémon; it is strictly a signature tool for these high-tier Uber legendaries.
* **Acquisition:** This move is only available in Generation VII. It cannot be used in later generations (Gen VIII+) due to the removal of the Z-Move mechanic. To activate it, the user must hold a **Solganium Z**.
