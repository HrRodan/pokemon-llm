## Identity & Mechanics
**Crunch** is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation II (Johto).
* **Description:** The user crushes the target with sharp fangs or powerful, vice-like jaws infused with dark energy. This predatory strike is a staple for Pokémon with high physical prowess, often used to overwhelm defensive walls by physically weakening their armor through sheer force.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent physical damage. Because it involves a crushing force, it has a significant chance to compromise the target's physical bulk.
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to lower the target’s **Defense** by one stage. (Note: In Generation II and III, this move targeted Special Defense due to the Dark type being Special-only prior to the Physical/Special split).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** While often competing with *Knock Off* for a moveset slot, Crunch is preferred for its higher base power and its ability to pressure opponents with Defense drops, which can force an opponent to switch out. It is a quintessential mid-tier power move that balances reliability with a helpful secondary effect. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Psychic** and **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Biting** move, making it eligible for a 50% power boost from the **Strong Jaw** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (286 learners), appearing on almost any Pokémon with significant dental or jaw features.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to **Tyranitar**, who uses it as a primary STAB (Same-Type Attack Bonus) move. It is also a staple for **Chien-Pao**, **Roaring Moon**, and **Zacian-Crowned**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Gyarados**, **Garchomp**, and **Feraligatr** to provide essential coverage against bulky Psychic-types (like Slowbro) or Ghost-types (like Dragapult).
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible; it has been a consistent **TM or TR** (Technical Record) in recent generations, including Sword/Shield and Scarlet/Violet.
