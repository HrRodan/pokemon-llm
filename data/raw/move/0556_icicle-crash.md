## Identity & Mechanics
**Icicle Crash** is a Physical Ice-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user manifests a massive, jagged pillar of ice and drops it with bone-chilling force onto the opponent. This heavy physical impact deals substantial damage and carries a freezing shock that can disorient the target, making it a staple for physical Ice-type attackers seeking to overwhelm defensive threats.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to make the target **Flinch**, preventing their move for the turn if the user acts first.
* **Targeting:** Single Pokemon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Icicle Crash is the gold standard for physical Ice-type STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus). It is favored over *Ice Punch* for its significantly higher damage output and game-changing flinch chance. While its 90% accuracy introduces a slight risk of missing, the "flinch-hax" potential makes it a primary tool for fast attackers to "cheat" past their counters. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Ground, and Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a physical move, it **does not make contact**, allowing the user to bypass damage from abilities like *Rough Skin* or items like *Rocky Helmet*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (30 learners), primarily concentrated among mammalian and reptilian Ice-types.
* **Prominent Users:** Extremely common on **Mamoswine**, **Chien-Pao**, **Baxcalibur**, and **Galarian Darmanitan**. It is a cornerstone of their offensive sets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by **Weavile** (via Sneasel) and **Alolan Sandslash** to provide high-power Ice coverage that physical attackers often lack compared to their Special-attacking counterparts.
* **Acquisition:** Often learned via level-up by specialized Ice-types or passed down as an Egg Move; it is notably rarer than the widely available Ice Beam TM.
