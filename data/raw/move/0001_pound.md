## Identity & Mechanics
**Pound** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto).
* **Description:** The user strikes the target with a simple, forceful blow using its forelegs, limbs, or tail. As one of the most fundamental physical attacks, it represents a basic exertion of blunt force, making it a staple move for many Pokémon in their earliest stages of development.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular physical damage with no additional properties.
* **Secondary Effect:** 0% (None).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-Game STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Pound is considered a "filler" move with virtually no viability in high-level play. It is strictly outclassed by superior Normal-type Physical moves such as **Body Slam** (for paralysis chance), **Double-Edge** (for raw power), or **Facade** (for status synergy). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **nothing**, as the Normal type provides no offensive advantages, and it is completely nullified by **Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Iron Barbs, or Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (102 learners), primarily concentrated among unevolved Pokémon and those with "cute" or "human-like" physiologies.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include the **Treecko** line (Sceptile), **Mew**, **Jigglypuff**, and the **Happiny** line (Blissey).
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen in the early-game movesets of diverse starters like **Piplup**, **Froakie**, **Sobble**, and **Quaxly** before they transition into their specialized elemental roles.
* **Acquisition:** Almost exclusively learned via **Level-up**. According to historical data, it is not available as a TM or TR, serving instead as a "starting move" that Pokémon naturally possess from birth or at Level 1.
