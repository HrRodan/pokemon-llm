## Identity & Mechanics
**Psyshock** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user materializes a strange, solidified psychic wave that manifests physically to batter the target. Unlike typical telepathic attacks that assault the mind, Psyshock creates a tangible pressure, allowing special attackers to bypass magical or spiritual fortifications and strike at the opponent's physical form.
* **Effect:** This move inflicts damage using the user's Special Attack stat, but it calculates damage against the target's physical **Defense** stat instead of their Special Defense.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Anti-Special Wall Nuke / Tactical Consistency.
* **Usage:** Psyshock is the premier tool for Special Sweepers to overcome "Special Walls" like **Blissey**, **Chansey**, and **Assault Vest** users. While it has 10 less base power than the move *Psychic*, its ability to target physical Defense makes it indispensable for monotype Special attackers who would otherwise be walled. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a non-contact move. It is unaffected by most protection abilities like *Bulletproof* but can be boosted by *Life Orb*, *Choice Specs*, and *Psychic Terrain*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (165 learners), making it a staple coverage and STAB option for almost all Psychic-types and many mystical non-Psychic types.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Mewtwo**, **Alakazam**, **Latios/Latias**, **Tapu Lele**, and **Calyrex-Shadow**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Psychic Pokémon like **Sylveon**, **Nihilego**, and **Flutter Mane** to allow them to break through Special Walls or hit Poison-type threats that resist their primary STAB. 
* **Acquisition:** Extremely accessible; it has been available as a **TM** (TM03 in Gen 5-7, TM25 in Gen 8-9) or **TR** (TR11) in every generation since its introduction.
