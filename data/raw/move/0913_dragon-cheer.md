## Identity & Mechanics
**Dragon Cheer** is a Status Dragon-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a resonant, primal draconic cry to embolden its teammates. This morale-boosting roar sharpens the focus of allies, significantly increasing their critical hit ratios. The draconic energy within the shout has a resonant frequency with other Dragon-types, granting them a much more potent offensive buff.
* **Effect:** Increases the critical hit ratio of all allied Pokémon on the field. While standard Pokémon receive a +1 stage boost, Dragon-type allies receive a massive +2 stage boost to their critical hit ratio.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Direct Stat/Crit Modifier).
* **Targeting:** Affects all allies on the user's side of the field (specifically designed for Doubles/Multi-battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [0], Accuracy [—]%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Offensive Support / Setup Utility.
* **Usage:** Primarily a **Doubles/VGC** specialist move. It acts as a superior version of *Focus Energy* for team support. When paired with a Dragon-type ally holding a Scope Lens or using a high-crit move (like *Stone Edge* or *Spacial Rend*), it guarantees 100% critical hits (Stage 3). This allows the partner to bypass the opponent's defensive stat boosts (Reflect, Aurora Veil, or Iron Defense) and Intimidate drops. It is often compared to *Helping Hand*, but offers long-term pressure rather than a one-turn burst.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage, but it is an essential tool for helping allies break through **Fairy, Steel, and bulky Water-type** walls.
* **Attributes:** Sound-based (bypassed by Soundproof, though it targets allies so this is rarely a hindrance).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution among draconic and "reptilian" Pokémon (62 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by **Hydrapple** (its thematic user), **Archaludon**, **Dragonite**, and **Kommo-o**. It is also a key support option for Legendaries like **Koraidon**, **Miraidon**, and **Rayquaza**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dragon Pokémon with "draconic" traits such as **Charizard**, **Gyarados**, and **Lapras** to provide unexpected offensive support in VGC formats. 
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM226** in the *Indigo Disk* DLC of Generation IX, requiring Blueberry Points (BP) or materials from the Tatsugiri and Lapras lines.
