## Identity & Mechanics
**Flower Trick** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user, acting with the flair of a master magician or phantom thief, hurls a rigged bouquet of flowers at the target. This botanical projectile is imbued with deceptive magic, ensuring it finds its mark regardless of the opponent's movements. Because the "trick" is perfectly executed, the impact is always a precision strike to a vital point.
* **Effect:** This attack **never misses** (bypassing accuracy and evasion checks) and is **guaranteed to land a critical hit** every time it is used.
* **Secondary Effect:** Guaranteed Critical Hit (100% chance). 
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy --%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **Unstoppable Wallbreaker** / **Consistency Option**.
* **Usage:** While the base power is 70, the guaranteed critical hit multiplier (1.5x) effectively raises its power to **105**. Most importantly, as a critical hit, it **ignores the user's negative stat stages** (such as Attack drops from *Intimidate* or *Burn*) and **ignores the target's positive defensive stat stages** (such as *Iron Defense* or *Reflect*). This makes it a premiere tool for bypassing "stall" tactics. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a Physical move, it does **not** make contact, allowing the user to avoid damage from *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Effect Spore*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Meowscarada**, the final evolution of the Paldean Grass-type starter, Sprigatito.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Meowscarada, it is the cornerstone of its offensive set. When paired with the Ability **Protean**, Meowscarada gains an immediate STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) boost, making the move even more oppressive against offensive and defensive threats alike.
* **Acquisition:** Only available through evolution/level-up for Meowscarada; it is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor for any other Pokémon.
