## Identity & Mechanics
**Buzzy Buzz** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation VII, specifically within the *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu!* and *Let's Go, Eevee!* titles.
* **Description:** The user focuses its energy to discharge a concentrated, high-frequency jolt of electricity at the target. This surge of bio-electric power is so potent that it short-circuits the opponent's nervous system upon impact.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and is guaranteed to inflict the **Paralysis** status condition on the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to Paralyze the opponent.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Utility / Speed Control**.
* **Usage:** While its Base Power is relatively low (comparable to moves like *Water Pulse* or *Shock Wave*), its 100% paralysis rate makes it one of the most oppressive utility moves in the game. It functions as a Special-category equivalent to *Nuzzle*, providing guaranteed speed reduction and a 25% chance for the opponent to lose their turn. It is used to cripple fast sweepers and provide **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus) chip damage simultaneously. 
* **Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, special projectile. It is blocked by the ability *Volt Absorb* or *Lightning Rod* and has no effect on **Ground-type** Pokémon.

* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the **Partner Eevee** in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Eevee!*. It is taught by the Move Tutor in Cerulean City.
