## Identity & Mechanics
**Jaw Lock** is a physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar).
* **Description:** The user clamps its powerful mandibles or teeth onto the target, physically anchoring itself to the opponent. This intense bite creates a "death grip" scenario where neither the attacker nor the defender can retreat from the battlefield. It is a high-utility move for predators designed to isolate and eliminate specific threats.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and prevents both the user and the target from switching out or fleeing. The trapping effect ends if either Pokémon faints or is forced out by a move like Roar or Whirlwind.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the **Trapping** status to both the user and the target upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Trapping Tool / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** While its power is identical to the more common *Crunch*, Jaw Lock is used for **Tactical Trapping**. It is particularly dangerous on bulky attackers or setup sweepers who want to pin a passive wall or a resisted opponent on the field to use them as "setup fodder." It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Biting move**, meaning its damage is boosted by 50% by the ability **Strong Jaw**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (only 5 learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Drednaw**, **Mabosstiff**, and **Roaring Moon**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** On **Roaring Moon**, it serves as a high-risk, high-reward STAB option that allows it to trap a target and boost its stats with Dragon Dance, though the user must be wary of being trapped against a Fairy-type counter. **Mabosstiff** and **Drednaw** utilize it effectively thanks to their **Strong Jaw** ability, turning it into a 120-power trapping nuke.
* **Acquisition:** It is a specialized move with no TM/TR availability; it is learned exclusively via level-up by a select few Pokémon with prominent jaw structures.
