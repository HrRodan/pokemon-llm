## Identity & Mechanics
**Kinesis** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user focuses its telekinetic power to distract the target, often visualized as the psychic bending of spoons or the warping of the air around the opponent. This mental interference disrupts the foe's focus, making it significantly harder for them to land precise strikes.
* **Effect:** Lowers the target’s accuracy by one stage.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 80%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Utility / Accuracy Debuff.
* **Usage:** Kinesis is a niche status move that is largely considered outclassed in competitive play. Compared to rival accuracy-reducing moves like **Flash** or **Sand Attack**—which boast 100% accuracy—Kinesis is a "High-Risk Utility" move due to its 80% accuracy check. In a competitive environment, Alakazam typically opts for high-speed **Nuke** options (like Psychic or Focus Blast) or more consistent **Utility** (like Encore or Taunt). Because it is a status move, it does not deal damage and therefore does not benefit from type-based Super Effective multipliers.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move. Bypassed by Pokémon with the *Keen Eye* ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (3 total learners), serving as a signature move for its evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Kadabra**, **Alakazam**, and **Mega Alakazam**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move for the Alakazam line, it is never seen as a coverage option on other Pokémon. Even within its own user base, it is frequently replaced by more reliable moves that provide better **Check** or **Pivot** potential.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR. It is primarily learned upon evolution or via Move Tutor/Heart Scale in specific generations.
