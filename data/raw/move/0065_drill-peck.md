## Identity & Mechanics
**Drill Peck** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user rotates its beak rapidly, creating a spiral, drilling motion as it charges the target. This high-velocity spinning allows the user to pierce through defenses with a sharp, concentrated peck.
* **Effect:** Inflicts straightforward physical damage with no additional effects.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Drill Peck serves as the gold standard for reliable Physical Flying-type damage. While it is often outdamaged by the more powerful **Brave Bird** (120 Power), Drill Peck is preferred on defensive sets or by Pokémon that cannot afford the heavy recoil damage associated with higher-tier Flying moves. It is a strictly better alternative to **Wing Attack** or **Aerial Ace** for Pokémon that learn it. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting, Grass, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (24 learners), restricted primarily to Pokémon with sharp, prominent beaks.
* **Prominent Users:** Historically a staple for **Zapdos** (especially in earlier generations), **Dodrio**, and **Corviknight**, the latter of which uses it for consistent damage without compromising its bulk via recoil.
* **Coverage Utility:** It is a unique coverage option for **Empoleon**, providing the Water/Steel starter a way to punish Fighting-type switch-ins. It is also utilized by **Galarian Zapdos** as a reliable STAB alternative to Thunderous Kick.
* **Acquisition:** Generally learned through leveling up; it has historically lacked wide availability as a TM, making it a specialized tool for natural avian learners.
