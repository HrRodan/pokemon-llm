## Identity & Mechanics
**Razor Shell** is a physical Water-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user utilizes sharpened shells, jagged carapaces, or hardened aquatic armor to slash and cleave the target. This maneuver combines brute physical force with a slicing motion, often leaving the opponent's defenses compromised. In modern generations, it is categorized as a "slicing move," benefiting from blade-based ability modifiers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage with a high probability of weakening the target's physical resilience.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s Defense stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Utility Physical STAB / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** While slightly weaker and less accurate than *Liquidation* (85 Power/100 Acc) or *Waterfall* (80 Power/100 Acc), Razor Shell is chosen for its oppressive **50% Defense drop chance**. This makes it a nightmare for defensive switch-ins, as it effectively softens up "walls" for the user or a teammate. In Generation IX, it gained significant viability due to the **Sharpness** ability, which boosts its power by 50%, surpassing even *Hydro Pump* in effective output for certain users.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Slicing** move (interacting with abilities like Sharpness).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (22 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with shells, carapaces, or blade-like anatomy.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconic on the **Samurott** line (including **Hisuian Samurott**), **Golisopod**, and **Cloyster**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Utilized by **Kingler** and **Barbaracle** as a secondary STAB option to fishing for Defense drops against physical tanks. It is also found on **Shellder** and **Corphish** in lower-tier competitive formats.
* **Acquisition:** While initially more exclusive, it became more accessible via **TM/TR** in Generation VIII (Sword & Shield), though it remains flavor-locked to shell-bearing or "sharp" aquatic Pokémon.
