## Identity & Mechanics
**Weather Ball** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user harnesses the prevailing atmospheric conditions to manifest a concentrated orb of elemental energy. Depending on the current weather, the ball morphs in appearance and intensity—becoming a searing sphere of flame in sunlight, a pressurized globule of water in rain, a frozen chunk of ice in snow, or a jagged mass of stone in a sandstorm.
* **Effect:** Under neutral weather conditions, it is a base 50 Power Normal-type move. If a weather condition is active, the move’s **Power doubles to 100** and its **Type changes** to match the weather:
    * **Harsh Sunlight:** Fire-type
    * **Rain:** Water-type
    * **Sandstorm:** Rock-type
    * **Hail/Snow:** Ice-type
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50 (100 in weather), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Conditional Nuke / Dynamic Coverage.
* **Usage:** Weather Ball is a staple on dedicated weather teams. While its base power is low, the doubling effect makes it a reliable 100 BP move that further benefits from weather-based damage modifiers (e.g., a 100 BP Fire-type Weather Ball in Sun effectively becomes 150 BP before STAB). It is often preferred over moves like *Hydro Pump* or *Fire Blast* for its perfect accuracy. 
* **Type Matchups:** Depending on the weather, it deals **Super Effective** damage to:
    * **Sun (Fire):** Grass, Ice, Bug, Steel.
    * **Rain (Water):** Fire, Ground, Rock.
    * **Sand (Rock):** Fire, Ice, Flying, Bug.
    * **Snow (Ice):** Grass, Ground, Flying, Dragon.
* **Attributes:** Considered a projectile move (blocked by Bulletproof).

    * **Castform:** The move's thematic mascot, whose form changes alongside the move's type.
    * **Alolan Ninetales:** Frequently uses it in Snow to provide reliable Ice-type damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-elemental Special attackers like **Raichu**, **Zapdos**, or **Mew** to surprise opponents when a specific weather is active.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (Gen VIII and IX), allowing a vast array of Special attackers to slot it into weather-dependent builds.
