## Identity & Mechanics
**Dig** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user burrows deep into the earth on the first turn, vanishing from the field of play to avoid incoming attacks. On the second turn, the Pokémon bursts from the ground beneath the target with explosive force. This classic tunneling maneuver is frequently used by burrowing creatures to ambush foes from a position of safety.
* **Effect:** A two-turn move. On turn one, the user enters a semi-invulnerable state. On turn two, the move deals damage. If the user is hit by **Earthquake**, **Magnitude**, or **Fissure** while underground, it takes double damage. The invulnerability is bypassed by Pokémon with the **No Guard** ability or those using **Lock-On** or **Mind Reader**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Semi-Invulnerable Stall / Casual Coverage.
* **Usage:** While powerful in Gen I (where it had 100 BP), Dig is largely outclassed in modern competitive play by **Earthquake** due to the latter's immediate damage and higher Base Power. However, Dig sees niche use in stalling out opponent's field effects (like Trick Room, Tailwind, or Weather) and can be paired with a **Power Herb** for a one-turn surprise nuke. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Electric, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move; users may be affected by items like Rocky Helmet or abilities like Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a massive distribution with **491** total learners, making it one of the most accessible moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Ground-types such as **Dugtrio**, **Excadrill**, **Garchomp**, and **Landorus-Therian** utilize it as a natural STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) option.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ground Pokémon to counter their natural checks. For example, **Charizard**, **Arcanine**, and **Lucario** can use Dig to surprise Rock or Electric-type switch-ins.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely common as a **TM** (Technical Machine) across almost every generation, including the original Kanto games (TM28) and modern titles like *Scarlet & Violet* (TM055).
