## Identity & Mechanics
**Rapid Spin** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user spins their body at incredible speeds to strike the opponent. This centripetal force allows the user to physically shake off external burdens, such as binding traps, parasitic seeds, and environmental hazards scattered across the battlefield. It is a fundamental tool for maintaining "field hygiene" in competitive play.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and removes **Leech Seed**, binding moves (e.g., **Wrap, Fire Spin, Magma Storm, Infestation**), and entry hazards (**Spikes, Stealth Rock, Toxic Spikes, Sticky Web**) from the user’s side of the field. In modern generations (Gen 8+), it also raises the user's **Speed** by one stage upon successful execution.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to increase the user's Speed by 1 stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 40 (Max 64).
* **Role:** Utility / Hazard Control / Speed Setup.
* **Usage:** Rapid Spin is a cornerstone of competitive singles. Unlike its rival move **Defog**, Rapid Spin only clears hazards on the *user's* side of the field and deals damage, allowing the user to maintain their own hazards on the opponent's side. However, because it is a Normal-type move, **Ghost-types** are immune to it; if a Ghost-type switches in, the move fails and no hazards are cleared (a tactic known as **Spinblocking**). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, but is resisted by Rock and Steel.
* **Attributes:** Makes contact. Affected by Protect, Mirror Move, and King's Rock.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (64 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with shells, drill-like appendages, or spherical bodies.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-tier threats like **Great Tusk**, **Excadrill**, and **Blastoise**. It is also a signature utility move for defensive pivots like **Torkoal**, **Forretress**, and **Tentacruel**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While rarely used for "coverage" due to its low base power and Normal typing, it is often seen on **Regieleki** and **Iron Treads** not for damage, but to provide critical Speed boosts while clearing the field for teammates.
* **Acquisition:** Distribution is primarily through natural leveling and Egg Moves; it is notably rarer as a TM/TR compared to other utility moves.
