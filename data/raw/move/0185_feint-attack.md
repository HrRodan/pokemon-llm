## Identity & Mechanics
**Feint Attack** (formerly known as Faint Attack) is a Physical Dark-type move introduced in Generation II.
* **Description:** The user approaches the target disarmingly before striking with a sudden, sneaky blow. This calculated deception ensures the attack is unavoidable, bypassing the target's movements or visual obstructions. It is a reliable tool for catching elusive opponents off guard.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move is unique because it ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers, meaning it will always land unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state (like Fly or Dig).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60, Accuracy ∞% (Never Misses), PP 20.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Tech Utility.
* **Usage:** While its Base Power is relatively low for late-game competitive play, Feint Attack serves as a **Consistency Option** against "evasion-cheese" strategies (e.g., Minimize or Double Team) and accuracy-dropping moves like Smokescreen. It is generally outclassed by **Knock Off** for utility or **Crunch** and **Throat Chop** for raw power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (108 learners), primarily concentrated among Pokémon with "sneaky," "predatory," or "dark" thematic elements.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Dark-types such as **Umbreon**, **Houndoom**, **Weavile**, and **Bisharp** often utilize this during level-up progression. The legendary **Darkrai** and the tactical **Greninja** also have access to it.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Dark Pokémon like **Flygon**, **Slaking**, and **Toxicroak** to provide reliable physical coverage against Ghost-types that might otherwise wall their primary attacks.
* **Acquisition:** While not a TM in recent generations, it was a staple Move Tutor or level-up move for a vast array of Pokémon across the Johto, Hoenn, and Sinnoh regions. It remains a common "bridge" move for physical attackers before they unlock higher-powered Dark-type moves.
