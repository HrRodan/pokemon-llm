## Identity & Mechanics
**Disable** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation I (Kanto region).
* **Description:** The user exerts a mental or physical interference that psychically suppresses the target's memory or ability to execute a specific technique. By focusing on the opponent's recent momentum, the user "locks" the most recently used move, rendering it unusable for a duration. This creates a strategic opening by forcing the opponent to rely on less optimal coverage or struggle.
* **Effect:** Prevents the target from using its last successfully executed move. The effect lasts for 4 to 7 turns (standard mechanics) or until the target switches out. It fails if the target has not used a move, if the move failed, if the move has 0 PP, or if the target is already under the effect of Disable.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the Disable status on successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy 100%, PP 20 (Max 32).
* **Role:** **Disruption Utility / Lockdown Tool.**
* **Usage:** Disable is a premier disruptive tool used to shut down "One-Trick" attackers or Choice-locked threats. It is most famously paired with **Substitute** or **Protect** (the "SubDisable" set); the user Protects to see the opponent's move, then Disables it the following turn, often forcing a switch. It is also the second half of the devastating **Encore + Disable** lock, which forces a Pokémon into a move and then prevents them from using it, essentially forcing them to use **Struggle**. Unlike Taunt, which stops all status moves, Disable targets specific offensive coverage.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses **Protect** in certain generations (check specific game engine), but is generally blocked by **Substitute** (Gen 4+) and **Magic Bounce**. As a Normal-type status move, it cannot hit Pokémon with the **Good as Gold** ability.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderately wide distribution with 100 known learners, primarily concentrated among Psychic, Ghost, and Dark-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Alakazam**, **Gengar** (especially Mega Gengar for "Perish Song" traps), **Mewtwo**, and **Iron Valiant**. These Pokémon utilize their high Speed tiers to Disable a threat before it can move a second time.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Salazzle** and **Scream Tail** to facilitate stall tactics, and **Slowbro/Slowking** variants to neuter physical attackers that threaten them.
* **Acquisition:** Historically available as TM55 in Generation I, but in modern titles, it is primarily learned via **Level Up** or as a highly valued **Egg Move**. In recent generations, it is not a standard TM/TR, making its presence on a team a deliberate and often unexpected "tech" choice.
