## Identity & Mechanics
**Life Dew** is a status Water-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Pokémon Sword & Shield).
* **Description:** The user disperses a restorative, life-giving mist or spray of enchanted water across the battlefield. This mysterious moisture permeates the area, revitalizing the user and any active allies by soothing wounds and restoring vitality. It is a key "cleric" move designed for team-wide sustainability.
* **Effect:** Restores the HP of the user and all active ally Pokémon by 25% of their maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User and Allies (Spread recovery).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Team Support / Multi-Target Recovery.
* **Usage:** Primarily a **VGC and Doubles** tool. While single-target recovery moves like *Recover* or *Soft-Boiled* restore 50% HP to the user, Life Dew sacrifices individual healing depth for breadth, keeping both Pokémon on the field healthy. It is often compared to *Heal Pulse*; while *Heal Pulse* restores 50% to an ally, Life Dew is preferred when the user also needs to maintain its own bulk to stay on the field. Because it is a Water-type move, it can trigger abilities like **Water Absorb** or **Dry Skin** on teammates for additional utility.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypassed by *Taunt*. It does not check accuracy and will work unless blocked by effects like *Heal Block*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (39 learners), primarily found among Pokémon with mystical, aquatic, or caring themes.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by defensive stalwarts and supports such as **Blissey**, **Milotic**, **Clefable**, and **Togekiss**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Interestingly found on non-Water types with diverse movepools like **Lucario**, **Hatterene**, and **Mew**, allowing them to pivot into a supportive "Combat Medic" role in specific team compositions.
* **Acquisition:** It is primarily learned through leveling up; it is not available as a TM or TR in its introductory generation, making its distribution somewhat exclusive to its natural learners.
