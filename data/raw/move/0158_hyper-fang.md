## Identity & Mechanics
**Hyper Fang** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user sinks its powerful, elongated front incisors into the target with savage force. This aggressive biting maneuver is designed to pierce tough hides, often leaving the opponent reeling from the impact. As a "fang" move, it carries thematic weight for rodent and predatory species.
* **Effect:** Inflicts physical damage to a single target. 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10% chance** to cause the target to **Flinch**, preventing them from acting for the remainder of the turn (provided the user moves first).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 90%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Mid-Tier Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Hyper Fang serves as a signature-style STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for many early-game Normal types. While its 80 Power is respectable, its **90% accuracy** makes it slightly riskier than moves like *Body Slam* or *Return*. In modern competitive play, it is often utilized by Pokémon with the **Strong Jaw** ability, which boosts the move's power by 50%, effectively turning it into a 120-power nuke. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, as it is a Normal-type move, but it is resisted by Rock and Steel and cannot hit Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** Contact move; categorized as a biting move (affected by Strong Jaw and Rocky Helmet).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow, thematic distribution (13 total learners), primarily limited to rodent-like Pokémon and those with prominent front teeth.
* **Prominent Users:** Most iconically used by **Raticate** (including its Alolan form) and **Gumshoos**, both of whom rely on it for mid-game power. **Bibarel** is another notable user that can utilize it alongside its Simple or Moody abilities.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on **Pachirisu** as a physical filler move, though it is rarely used for coverage on non-Normal types because Normal-type attacks lack super-effective hit zones.
* **Acquisition:** This move is generally **not available via TM or TR**; it is almost exclusively learned via level-up by specific biological lineages, making its presence in a kit highly predictable.
