## Identity & Mechanics
**Ingrain** is a Status Grass-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user plants deep, vegetative roots into the soil to absorb nutrients from the earth. This process provides a consistent stream of passive healing but physically anchors the Pokémon to the ground, preventing it from fleeing or being switched out of battle. This move is a staple for defensive "stall" archetypes and stationary tanks.
* **Effect:** The user restores 1/16 of its maximum HP at the end of every turn. While active, the user cannot switch out manually or be forced out by moves like **Roar** or **Whirlwind**. Additionally, it "grounds" the user; Flying-types or Pokémon with Levitate become vulnerable to Ground-type moves.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Status move). 
* **Targeting:** Self.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy [—]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Setup.
* **Usage:** Ingrain is a high-risk sustainability tool. Its primary niche is providing cumulative recovery that stacks with **Leftovers** and **Aqua Ring**. Unlike other healing moves, its protection against "phazing" (forced switching) makes it valuable for Pokémon that have spent several turns boosting their stats. However, the self-trapping effect is a massive double-edged sword, as it allows the opponent to bring in a "Counter" or "Wallbreaker" that the user cannot escape from. It is frequently seen in **Baton Pass** chains, as the Ingrain effect can be passed to a teammate.
* **Attributes:** Grounding effect (removes Ground immunity/Magnet Rise).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), primarily concentrated among Grass-types and biological "plant" Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Ferrothorn**, **Amoonguss**, **Cradily**, and the legendary **Xerneas**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on defensive Ultra Beasts like **Celesteela** or Paradox Pokémon like **Brute Bonnet** to maximize longevity during long stalls.
* **Acquisition:** While not a common TM/TR in recent generations, it is a natural level-up move for the majority of evolving Grass-type lines.
