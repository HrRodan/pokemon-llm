## Identity & Mechanics
**Blizzard** is a Special Ice-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user summons a howling gale of freezing air and crushing snow, buffeting the targets with sub-zero temperatures. This intense storm is so powerful it can bypass the defenses of protected foes and becomes perfectly accurate when the weather is set to Hail or Snow.
* **Effect:** Inflicts significant special damage. In Double Battles, it targets all adjacent opponents. It features a unique bypass mechanic where it has a 30% chance (100 minus its base accuracy) to hit through the moves Protect and Detect.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to **Freeze** the target.
* **Weather Synergy:** Its accuracy increases to **100% during Hail or Snow**.
* **Targeting:** All opponents (Spread Move).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 110, Accuracy 70%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Weather-Reliable Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Blizzard is the high-power alternative to **Ice Beam**. While Ice Beam is preferred for its consistency (100% accuracy), Blizzard is the premier choice for "Snow Teams" (or Hail teams in earlier generations). In VGC and Double Battles, it is a devastating **Spread Move** that can pressure both opponents simultaneously without the damage reduction penalty usually associated with spread moves being as detrimental given its high base power. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon, Flying, Grass, and Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not affected by Bulletproof or Soundproof.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (315 learners), being a staple TM move across almost every generation.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Articuno**, **Abomasnow** (who sets the Snow required for perfect accuracy), **Kyurem-White**, and **Iron Bundle**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by Water-types like **Kyogre**, **Blastoise**, and **Starmie** to threaten Grass and Dragon-type switch-ins. It is also a common coverage choice for versatile attackers like **Nidoking** and **Mewtwo**.
* **Acquisition:** Highly accessible; it has appeared as **TM14** in most generations and remains a top-tier Technical Machine in the most recent games.
