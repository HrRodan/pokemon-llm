## Identity & Mechanics
**Hammer Arm** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user puts its entire body weight into a massive, swinging strike using its heavy, muscular arm. This crushing blow deals significant physical damage but the momentum and weight of the limb cause the user to lose agility. This flavor makes it a thematic staple for "heavyweight" or "brute" archetypes.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and reduces the user's Speed stat by one stage (100% chance).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the **User's Speed**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 90%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** **High-Power Wallbreaker** / **Trick Room Enabler**.
* **Usage:** Hammer Arm is a potent alternative to *Close Combat* or *Superpower* for bulky attackers. While it has lower accuracy, it does not compromise the user's defensive stats, making it superior for sustain-based tanks. Critically, it is a premier choice for **Trick Room** teams, where the Speed drop effectively acts as a "speed boost," allowing the user to move faster under the twisted dimensions.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Steel, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Iron Barbs or items like Rocky Helmet. It is also classified as a **Punching Move**, meaning its power is boosted by the ability **Iron Fist** (e.g., on Conkeldurr or Melmetal).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (66 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with large, powerful limbs or "heavy" physical builds.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic on **Metagross**, **Conkeldurr** (who benefits from the Iron Fist boost), and **Swampert (Mega)**. It is also a signature-style move for Regi-titans like **Regigigas** and **Regirock**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by non-Fighting types like **Rillaboom**, **Mudsdale**, and **Landorus-Therian** to provide essential coverage against Steel and Ice-type threats that would otherwise wall their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** While often learned naturally via leveling up by heavy hitters, it has appeared as a **TM/TR** in various generations (notably TR37 in Gen VIII), making it accessible to a wide variety of physical bruisers.
