## Identity & Mechanics
**Aqua Ring** is a Status Water-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh).
* **Description:** The user surrounds its body with a swirling veil of revitalizing water. This moisture-rich aura provides a constant source of hydration, allowing the Pokémon to steadily mend its wounds over the course of a battle. This effect acts as a "pseudo-Leftovers" status, providing incremental healing that is essential for long-term survival.
* **Effect:** The user restores 1/16 (6.25%) of its maximum HP at the end of every turn. This effect persists as long as the user remains on the field. Notably, this effect can be transferred to a teammate via the move **Baton Pass**.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** User (Self).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 20.
* **Role:** Passive Recovery / Setup Utility.
* **Usage:** Aqua Ring is primarily used on **Stall** or **Semi-Stall** teams to stack passive healing. When used in conjunction with the **Leftovers** held item, the user recovers 1/8 (12.5%) of its HP every turn, making it significantly harder to chip down. Its niche in competitive play is bolstered by its interaction with **Baton Pass**, allowing a bulky pivot to set up a permanent healing stream for a more fragile sweeper. It is often compared to *Ingrain*, though Aqua Ring is superior because it does not trap the user in combat. As a status move, it does not deal damage and therefore has no Super Effective coverage.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy checks; effect is lost upon switching unless Baton Passed.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (61 learners), almost exclusively limited to Water-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-HP or defensive titans such as **Kyogre**, **Milotic**, **Vaporeon**, and **Alomomola**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** While it is rarely seen on non-Water types, it is a staple for defensive **Empoleon** sets and is occasionally seen on **Tapu Fini** to mitigate the lack of reliable recovery in its base kit.
* **Acquisition:** It is rarely a TM/TR and is most commonly learned through natural leveling or as an Egg Move for aquatic species.
