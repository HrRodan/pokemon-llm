## Identity & Mechanics
**Temper Flare** is a Physical Fire-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet: The Indigo Disk).
* **Description:** Spurred by desperation and frustration, the user channels its failed momentum into an intense, scorching outburst. The user envelops itself in a vengeful aura of flame, striking the opponent with increased ferocity if its previous attempt to act was thwarted.
* **Effect:** This move deals damage. Its base power doubles from 75 to **150** if the user’s previous move failed in the same or previous turn (e.g., due to the target using Protect, the move missing, or the user being blocked by an ability like Flash Fire).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Power doubling is a mechanic, not a secondary status effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75 (150 if triggered), Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Punisher / Conditional Nuke.
* **Usage:** Temper Flare serves as the Fire-type equivalent to *Stomping Tantrum*. In competitive VGC (Doubles), it is an excellent tool to punish the frequent use of **Protect** or **Detect**. While **Flare Blitz** remains the gold standard for raw STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) power, Temper Flare is a "Consistency Option" that lacks recoil and provides a massive 150-power payoff if the opponent successfully stalls or if a high-risk move like *Stone Edge* misses. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move makes **Contact**, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a Wide distribution (74 learners), primarily concentrated among physical attackers and Fire-type starters.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Koraidon**, **Gouging Fire**, **Arcanine (including Hisuian form)**, and **Incineroar**. These Pokémon benefit from a reliable physical Fire move that doesn't force recoil damage.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon like **Great Tusk**, **Salamence**, and **Gyarados**. For these Pokémon, Temper Flare provides vital coverage to counter **Steel-type** walls like Corviknight or Gholdengo, especially if their primary moves are blocked.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM207** in Generation IX, making it accessible to a vast array of physical bruisers.
