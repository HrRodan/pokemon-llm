## Identity & Mechanics
**Night Daze** is a Special Dark-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user releases a massive, ominous pitch-black shock wave of dark energy that crashes into the target. This burst of shadowy power is so intense that it visually disorients the opponent, potentially clouding their vision and causing their own attacks to miss.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and has a high probability of disrupting the opponent's vision.
* **Secondary Effect:** 40% chance to lower the target’s Accuracy by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Disruptive Special STAB / Signature Nuke.
* **Usage:** Night Daze serves as a high-reward alternative to *Dark Pulse*. While it possesses 5 more base power, its 95% accuracy introduces a slight risk of missing. The primary draw is the **40% accuracy drop chance**, which is significantly higher than most secondary effects, often forcing opponents to switch out to reset their stats. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not blocked by most common defensive abilities like Bulletproof or Soundproof.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (3 total learners), historically serving as a signature move for specific evolutionary lines.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Zoroark** and its pre-evolution **Zorua**, for whom it was originally a signature move. It is also learned by the legendary Pokémon **Lunala**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its extremely limited distribution, it is rarely seen as a coverage move on non-Dark types. It is almost exclusively used by the aforementioned Pokémon to capitalize on **STAB** (Same Type Attack Bonus).
* **Acquisition:** This move is **not available via TM or TR**. It must be learned via leveling up, making it a rare and specialized tool in competitive formats.
