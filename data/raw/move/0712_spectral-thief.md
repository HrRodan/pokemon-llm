## Identity & Mechanics
**Spectral Thief** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation VII (Pokémon Sun & Moon).
* **Description:** The user deceptively slips into the target’s shadow, manifesting as a spectral force to siphon away the opponent's momentum. It physically drains the target's stat enhancements, turning their own bolstered power against them before delivering a crushing blow from the darkness.
* **Effect:** This move steals all of the target’s positive stat increases (stages) and applies them to the user *before* dealing damage. It will not steal increases that would exceed the user's +6 cap in any stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (The stat theft is a primary mechanic of the move, not a percentage-based secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Anti-Setup Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Spectral Thief is one of the most feared utility-offense moves in competitive play. Because it steals boosts *before* the damage calculation, it allows the user to ignore the opponent’s defensive buffs and potentially OHKO sweepers using their own offensive boosts. It is the ultimate check to "Setup Sweepers" like Xerneas (Geomancy) or Arceus (Extreme尊/Swords Dance). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Despite its mystical nature, it is a Physical attack.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by the Mythical Pokémon **Marshadow**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is exclusive to Marshadow, it is rarely seen as "coverage" on other Pokémon; however, for Marshadow, it provides a perfect STAB pairing with its Fighting-type moves, creating unresisted coverage against almost the entire Pokédex. 
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It is tied strictly to Marshadow’s level-up set (Level 45 in Generation VII and VIII).
