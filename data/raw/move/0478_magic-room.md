## Identity & Mechanics
**Magic Room** is a Status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user projects a mystical, dimension-warping field that distorts the properties of physical objects. This bizarre area suppresses the mystical energy of held items, rendering them completely inert for both allies and opponents. It is a field-wide "room" move, similar to Trick Room or Wonder Room, designed to disrupt strategies reliant on equipment and held tools.
* **Effect:** For five turns, the passive effects of all held items are ignored. Pokémon cannot use their items (e.g., Berries will not trigger), and stat-modifying items (e.g., Choice Specs, Eviolite, Life Orb) provide no bonuses.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. This move acts as a field state.
* **Targeting:** Entire Field (affects all Pokémon in play).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Niche Utility / Counter-Meta Disruption.
* **Usage:** Magic Room is a high-level "tech" choice used to dismantle specific defensive or offensive cores. Unlike **Knock Off**, which removes an item permanently, or **Trick**, which swaps them, Magic Room temporary disables *all* items on the field. It is most effective at neutralizing **Eviolite** users (like Chansey or Porygon2), stripping **Focus Sashes** from hyper-offensive leads, and disabling **Choice Scarf** revenge killers to allow a teammate to sweep. However, it is rarely seen due to its short duration and the fact that it may hinder the user's own team.
* **Attributes:** This move is a field effect; it does not make contact and is not affected by Protect (though the activation itself cannot be blocked).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (84 learners), primarily concentrated among Psychic and Fairy-type Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently associated with high-intellect Psychic types such as **Alakazam**, **Mewtwo**, **Gardevoir**, and **Tapu Lele**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen as a "surprise tech" on Pokémon like **Klefki** (utilizing Prankster for priority activation), **Mimikyu**, or **Araquanid** to disrupt opponents who rely on specific item-based survival or speed tiers.
* **Acquisition:** It has been available as a **TM/TR** in various generations, most notably as a TR in Pokémon Sword & Shield.
