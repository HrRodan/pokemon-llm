## Identity & Mechanics
**Headbutt** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user lowers its head and charges at the target, delivering a powerful ramming strike. This brute-force physical contact is delivered with enough momentum to potentially disorient the opponent upon impact, making it a staple move for Pokémon with sturdy craniums or aggressive charging behaviors.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **30% chance** to make the target **flinch**, preventing them from executing their move if the user acts first in the turn.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Utility Flinch-Slayer.
* **Usage:** While outclassed in raw damage by moves like *Return* or *Double-Edge*, Headbutt is prized in lower tiers and playthroughs for its high flinch rate. It is the cornerstone of "Para-Flinch" strategies when paired with Thunder Wave, as the combination of paralysis and a 30% flinch chance significantly reduces the opponent's "chance to move" (often referred to as being "locked down").
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **no Super Effective damage** to any type. It is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types, and **Ghost** types are immune to it.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely wide distribution with **529 total learners**, making it one of the most accessible physical moves in the franchise.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Snorlax**, **Kangaskhan**, **Slaking**, and **Tauros**, who utilize their high Attack stats and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) to capitalize on the flinch chance.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on a massive variety of non-Normal types such as **Tyranitar**, **Dragonite**, and **Garchomp** during early-game progression or in specific formats where reliable neutral coverage is needed.
* **Acquisition:** Historically significant as a **TM** in Generation II (where it was also used as an out-of-battle field move to shake trees) and returning as a TM in *Pokémon: Let's Go, Pikachu! & Let's Go, Eevee!*. It is a common "Move Tutor" or "Level-up" move for mammalian and reptilian Pokémon.
