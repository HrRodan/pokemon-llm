## Identity & Mechanics
**Doodle** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user captures the very essence of the target in a rapid, artistic sketch—akin to graffiti or street art. This visual mimicry allows the user and their active ally to synchronize their biological traits with the opponent, instantly overwriting their own capabilities to mirror the target's innate power.
* **Effect:** Changes the Abilities of both the user and its partner Pokémon to match the Ability of the targeted Pokémon.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Directly targets one opponent or ally, but the effect propagates to the user and their partner).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [—], Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Double Battle Utility / Archetype Enabler.
* **Usage:** Doodle is a niche but explosive support move specifically designed for **VGC (Doubles)** formats. Unlike *Skill Swap* or *Role Play*, Doodle is uniquely powerful because it updates two Pokémon at once. It is primarily used to overwrite detrimental abilities (like Slaking's *Truant* or Regigigas's *Slow Start*) or to spread top-tier offensive abilities (like *Huge Power*, *Protosynthesis*, or *Sword of Ruin*) across the user's side of the field. It deals **Neutral** utility impact, as it does not deal damage, but it effectively bypasses traditional team-building limitations.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; bypasses *Protect* if targeting an ally but is blocked by *Protect* if targeting an opponent. It fails if the target has an uncopyable Ability (e.g., *Commander*, *Quark Drive*, or *Tera Shift*).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a **Signature Move** (1 total learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Grafaiai**. Its high Speed tier allows it to execute Doodle before its partner moves, ensuring the Ability change takes effect for the duration of the turn.
* **Synergy Utility:** Frequently paired with heavy hitters that suffer from negative abilities. By targeting a high-value opponent (like an Incineroar with *Intimidate*), Grafaiai can simultaneously buff itself and a partner like **Slaking**, turning a liability into a double-threat.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; learned exclusively via Level Up by the Shroodle line in the Paldea region.
