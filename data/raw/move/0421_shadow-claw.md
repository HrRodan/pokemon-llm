## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Claw** is a Physical Ghost-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user manifests malevolent, spectral energy into a razor-sharp claw to slash at the target from the shadows. This ethereal strike is designed to bypass standard defenses to strike at vital points, making it a "High Crit" move that frequently bypasses stat boosts through critical hits.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage with an increased critical-hit ratio (Stage +1).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The high critical hit rate is a built-in mechanic rather than a triggered secondary effect).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 70, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** While its base power is modest, Shadow Claw is often the most reliable physical Ghost-type move available, as it lacks the two-turn drawback of *Phantom Force* or the "held item" requirement of *Poltergeist*. In modern generations, it is significantly buffed by the **Sharpness** ability, which increases its power by 50%. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move and is classified as a **Slicing** move, benefiting from various ability-based power boosts.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (251 learners), making it one of the most accessible physical coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a signature-style STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for **Mimikyu**, **Ceruledge**, **Aegislash**, and **Giratina**. **Annihilape** and **Decidueye** also utilize it in formats where higher-power alternatives are unavailable.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Ghost Physical attackers like **Garchomp**, **Lucario**, **Excadrill**, and **Zeraora** to provide a way to hit bulky Psychic-type walls or opposing Ghost-types like *Skeledirge* or *Dragapult*.
* **Acquisition:** Shadow Claw is a staple **TM/TR** (TM65 in many generations) and is widely available to almost any Pokémon with claws or sharp appendages.
