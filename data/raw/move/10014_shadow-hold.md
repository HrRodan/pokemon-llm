## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Hold** is a Status Shadow-type move introduced in Generation III, specifically appearing in the spin-off title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user manifests a dark, spectral aura that anchors the opposition to the ground, preventing them from fleeing or being recalled by their trainer. It creates a field of oppressive shadow energy that ensures the target remains engaged in combat.
* **Effect:** The target cannot switch out normally. This move is unique in that it ignores all accuracy and evasion modifiers, ensuring the trapping effect is applied successfully. The effect ends immediately if the user leaves the field. However, the target can still escape via pivoting moves like *U-turn* or *Baton Pass*, or by holding a *Shed Shell*. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to trap).
* **Targeting:** Opponents-field (Targets all adjacent opponents in double battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —% (Sure-hit), PP — (Shadow moves use a unique gauge/infinite system in *XD*).
* **Role:** **Trapping Utility / Support.**
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, Shadow Hold serves as a Shadow-type variant of moves like *Mean Look*, *Block*, or *Spider Web*. Its primary competitive niche is preventing "Shadow Pokémon" from being swapped out, allowing the player to safely whittle down their HP for capture. Because it targets the entire opposing field, it is exceptionally powerful in the 2v2 format of the Orre region, potentially pinning two threats at once.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Shadow-type move, it bypasses traditional type immunities (including those of Normal or Dark types) within its native game engine.
* **Attributes:** Field-effect; Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Non-contact.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Shadow Hold has a specialized distribution, limited exclusively to **Shadow Pokémon** prior to their purification. 
* **Prominent Users:** It is most famously utilized by **Shadow Lugia** (the flagship of *Pokémon XD*), as well as various Shadow Pokémon encountered throughout the Orre region such as **Shadow Rhydon** or **Shadow Arcanine**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because "Shadow" is a temporary state for a Pokémon, this move is never seen on purified or standard Pokémon. It is a signature mechanic of the Cipher organization’s modified creatures.
* **Acquisition:** This move is never available via TM/TR or Move Tutor. It is a "natural" move for specific Shadow Pokémon and is lost permanently once the Pokémon undergoes the Purification process to regain its standard moveset.
