## Identity & Mechanics
**Heal Pulse** is a status Psychic-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user projects a soothing, restorative aura in the form of rhythmic psychic waves. This pulse envelopes the target, instantly sealing wounds and revitalizing their stamina. As a "pulse" move, it carries thematic resonance with wave-based abilities and can be projected across the battlefield to reach distant allies.
* **Effect:** Restores the target's HP by 50% of its maximum HP. Notably, if the user has the ability **Mega Launcher** (like Clawitzer), the healing potency is increased to 75% of the target's maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Typically used on an ally in Doubles; can technically be used to heal an opponent).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —% (Bypasses Accuracy checks), PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Supportive Cleric / Doubles Specialist.
* **Usage:** Heal Pulse is a cornerstone of **Doubles and VGC** strategies but is virtually non-existent in Singles, as the move cannot be used to heal the user itself. It is primarily used to keep a "sweeper" or a "tank" healthy while the Heal Pulse user provides utility. It competes with **Life Dew** (which heals both allies for 25%) and **Pollen Puff** (which provides the flexibility of damage or healing).
* **Attributes:** Classified as a **Pulse move**; its effectiveness is boosted by the ability Mega Launcher. It is blocked by the move *Protect* but can bypass *Substitute* to heal an ally.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderate distribution (48 learners), primarily found among Psychic, Fairy, and high-intellect Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Frequently utilized by high-durability supports like **Chansey/Blissey**, **Tapu Fini**, and **Alomomola**. Legendaries like **Latias** and **Calyrex** also have access to it for specialized support sets.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on offensive Pokémon like **Lucario** or **Gardevoir** in dedicated Doubles support roles to surprise opponents who expect a pure offensive presence. **Clawitzer** is the most unique user, utilizing *Mega Launcher* to provide massive 75% heals.
* **Acquisition:** While not a TM in the current generation, it has historically been available via **Move Tutor** or as a **TR (Technical Record)** in Generation VIII.
