## Identity & Mechanics
**After You** is a **Status Normal-type** move introduced in **Generation V (Unova)**.
* **Description:** The user adopts a supportive posture, courteously signaling an ally or target to take their turn immediately following the user's action. This tactical coordination effectively overrides the natural speed tiers and priority brackets of the battlefield, allowing slower teammates to "cut the line" and execute powerful maneuvers before opponents can react.
* **Effect:** The target is forced to take its action immediately after the user of After You. This move bypasses traditional Speed stats and even move priority (e.g., allowing a target to use a -6 priority move like Roar immediately). If the target has already acted in the current turn, the move fails.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (most effective when targeting an ally in Double or Triple Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [—]%, PP 15.
* **Role:** **Speed Manipulation / Offensive Support.**
* **Usage:** After You is a niche but devastating tool in **Double Battles (VGC)**. Its primary utility is to allow a very fast Pokémon to "pull" a very slow, high-damage teammate (a "Nuke") into acting early. It is a direct alternative to **Trick Room** or **Tailwind**, offering a more immediate, single-turn solution to Speed disadvantages. It is particularly effective for bypassing an opponent's own Speed control.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Status move, it does not deal damage and ignores Type-based resistance/weakness logic.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move and is not blocked by **Protect** if used on an ally, making it a reliable way to ensure a teammate's move lands.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (**118** learners), appearing frequently among "helpful" or "polite" Pokémon designs.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Lilligant:** Famous for the "After You + Eruption" combo; under Sun, its **Chlorophyll** ability makes it fast enough to let a slow **Torkoal** unleash a full-power Eruption before the enemy moves.
    * **Clefairy / Clefable:** Frequently used in VGC as a redirection and turn-order support piece.
    * **Togekiss:** A premier bulky support Pokémon that can utilize After You to help slower wallbreakers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on **Oranguru** or **Buneary/Lopunny**, who can use their unique speed tiers or abilities to manipulate the turn order of heavy-hitting partners like **Snorlax** or **Dracovish**.
* **Acquisition:** While it is a natural level-up move for many, it has been available as a **Tutor Move** in various generations (notably Ultra Sun/Moon) and as a **TM** in recent titles.
