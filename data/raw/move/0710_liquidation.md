## Identity & Mechanics
**Liquidation** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user pressurizes a massive volume of water around its body or limb, slamming into the target with the force of a tidal wave. This hydraulic impact is so powerful it can crush the target's armor or natural defenses. As a contact move, it utilizes the user's Physical Attack stat and interacts with abilities like Tough Claws or items like Rocky Helmet.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. 
* **Secondary Effect:** 20% chance to lower the target’s Defense stat by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Physical Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Liquidation is the gold standard for Physical Water-type STAB. It is generally preferred over **Waterfall** (80 Power) for the extra damage and more relevant Defense-drop chance, and it is favored over **Aqua Tail** (90 Power) due to its perfect accuracy. The 20% Defense drop chance makes it dangerous for physical walls to switch into, as a timely proc can turn a 3HKO into a 2HKO. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Iron Barbs, Rough Skin, and King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution (172 learners), significantly buffing Physical Water attackers who previously relied on the weaker Waterfall.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Feraligatr** (who boosts it further with Sheer Force), **Araquanid** (leveraging the Water Bubble ability for massive damage), **Palafin (Hero Form)**, and **Barraskewda** in Rain-based teams.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Water Pokémon like **Garchomp**, **Beartic**, and **Eelektross** to provide critical coverage against Fire and Ground types that would otherwise check them.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available as a **TM/TR** (Technical Machine/Record) in Generation VIII (Sword/Shield) and Generation IX (Scarlet/Violet), making it a staple move-pool addition for almost any physical aquatic creature.
