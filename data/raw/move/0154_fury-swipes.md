## Identity & Mechanics
**Fury Swipes** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user unleashes a rapid succession of frantic scratches or claw strikes against the target. Visually, this involves the Pokémon using its sharp appendages—claws, talons, or paws—to strike the opponent 2 to 5 times in a single turn. This move is a staple for feline, ursine, and avian Pokémon that rely on feral, physical agility.
* **Effect:** This is a multi-hit move that deals damage 2–5 times per use. It has a 37.5% (3/8) chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% (1/8) chance to hit 4 or 5 times.
* **Secondary Effect:** None. However, each individual strike can trigger a Critical Hit or contact-based abilities/items separately.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 18 (Per hit), Accuracy 80%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Multi-Hit Utility / Substitute Breaker.
* **Usage:** While generally outclassed by more reliable Normal-type moves like *Return* or *Body Slam* due to its low accuracy and inconsistent damage, Fury Swipes excels at **breaking Focus Sashes, Sturdy, and Substitutes**. Because each hit is calculated independently, the first few strikes can destroy a Substitute or trigger a Focus Sash, allowing subsequent hits to deal direct damage. It is particularly potent when used by Pokémon with the **Technician** ability, which boosts the base power of each hit from 18 to 27.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types. It is **resisted by Rock and Steel** types and has **no effect on Ghost** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning the user is susceptible to effects like *Rocky Helmet*, *Rough Skin*, or *Iron Barbs* on every individual hit, which can lead to massive recoil damage.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (99 learners), primarily among Pokémon with claws or sharp limbs.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the **Meowth/Persian** line (especially Alolan forms), **Incineroar**, and **Charizard**. It is a signature early-game move for many "Starting Route" mammals.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on non-Normal types like **Weavile**, **Excadrill**, and **Zeraora** during the leveling process, though it is almost always replaced by higher-tier coverage or STAB moves in competitive sets.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up. Notably, it is **not available as a TM or TR** in most generations, making it a "natural" move for feral or predatory Pokémon.
