## Identity & Mechanics
**Spiky Shield** is a status Grass-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user protects itself by deploying a defensive barrier covered in sharp, jagged thorns. This move not only negates all incoming damage from most attacks for the turn but also punishes any opponent that makes direct physical contact with the user, dealing chip damage.
* **Effect:** Protects the user from all effects of moves during the turn it is used. If a move that makes **contact** is used against the Pokémon, the attacker loses 1/8th (12.5%) of its maximum HP.
* **Secondary Effect:** Like Protect, its success rate drops by 50% if used consecutively. It does not protect against certain status moves (like Taunt) or moves that bypass protection (like Feint or Urshifu’s Unseen Fist).
* **Targeting:** Affects the User (Self-target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — (N/A), Accuracy —%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Defensive Utility / Punishment / Scouting.
* **Usage:** Spiky Shield is a strictly superior version of **Protect** for the Pokémon that have access to it. It is used to scout enemy items/moves, stall for Leftovers recovery, or rack up chip damage against physical attackers. In competitive doubles (VGC), it is a vital tool for positioning and punishing "Fake Out" or "U-turn" users.
* **Attributes:** High-priority move (+4). The 1/8 HP reduction is fixed damage, making it an excellent tool for breaking **Focus Sashes** or wearing down bulky physical attackers.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (11 learners), primarily restricted to Pokémon with themes of spikes, thorns, or biological armor.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic to the Kalos Starter **Chesnaught**, the versatile Legendary **Ogerpon** (all masks), and the disruptive **Togedemaru**, which often pairs it with "Nuzzle" to frustrate opponents.
* **Coverage Utility:** **Glimmora** utilizes Spiky Shield effectively to stall for "Toxic Spikes" layers or to punish opponents attempting to clear its hazards with contact moves like Rapid Spin.
* **Acquisition:** This move is generally not available via TM or TR, making it a rare and valuable part of the natural movepools for the specific Pokémon that learn it.
