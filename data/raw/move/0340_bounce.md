## Identity & Mechanics
**Bounce** is a Physical Flying-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user leaps high into the air on the first turn, hovering in a semi-invulnerable state above the battlefield, and then crashes down onto the target on the second turn. This aerial maneuver allows the user to evade most incoming attacks while preparing a high-impact descent.
* **Effect:** A two-turn move. On turn one, the user becomes semi-invulnerable. On turn two, it deals damage. While in the air, the user can still be hit by certain moves including **Thunder**, **Hurricane**, **Gust**, **Twister**, **Sky Uppercut**, and **Smack Down**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 30% chance to **Paralyze** the target upon impact.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 85, Accuracy 85%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk STAB / Setup Stall.
* **Usage:** While the two-turn nature typically makes it easy to predict or "protect" against, it serves as a crucial **Dynamax** tool in Generation VIII to access **Max Airstream** (boosting Speed). In standard play, it is used by Pokémon that lack better Flying-type Physical STAB (like Brave Bird) or to fish for paralysis while burning a turn of the opponent's weather or terrain. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Fighting, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move. It is hindered by **Gravity** and cannot be called by **Sleep Talk**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (136 learners), frequently found on Pokémon with high jumping capabilities or aquatic Pokémon that "breach" the water.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic users include **Gyarados** (who often relies on it for its only Physical Flying STAB), **Cinderace** (utilizing Libero for STAB), and **Galarian Zapdos**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Flying Pokémon like **Blaziken**, **Lopunny**, and **Toxicroak** to provide essential coverage against Fighting or Grass-type threats that resist their primary STAB moves.
* **Acquisition:** It has appeared as a Move Tutor move in various generations and was widely available as **TM52** in Pokémon Sword and Shield.
