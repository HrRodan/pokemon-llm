## Identity & Mechanics
**Acid Downpour (Physical)** is a Physical Poison-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** By channeling Z-Power into a Poisonium Z crystal, the user manifests a massive, corrosive swamp of toxic sludge beneath the target. The opponent is dragged into the caustic mire and struck with a pressurized deluge of venom. This move represents the ultimate manifestation of physical Poison-type energy, transforming the user's base move into a high-impact, one-time offensive.
* **Effect:** This move can only be used if the trainer possesses a Z-Ring (or Z-Power Ring) and the Pokémon is holding a **Poisonium Z**. It upgrades a base physical Poison-type move into a single-use nuke. The power of the move scales based on the base move's original power (e.g., a move like Gunk Shot results in a significantly stronger Acid Downpour than Poison Sting).
* **Secondary Effect:** Like most Z-Moves, this attack **bypasses accuracy checks** (it cannot miss unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Dig or Fly) and deals 25% of its damage through protection moves like Protect or Detect.
* **Targeting:** Single-target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100-190], Accuracy [--]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Physical Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Gen 7 competitive formats to secure KOs against defensive **Fairy-types** or to provide a sudden burst of damage that the opponent cannot easily switch into. It is the "Consistency Option" for high-power, low-accuracy moves like Gunk Shot, ensuring a 100% hit rate for one turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy** and **Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is neither a contact move nor sound-based, regardless of the properties of the base move it was derived from.

## Distribution & Notable Users
Distribution is technically "Universal" for any Pokémon capable of learning a Physical Poison-type move while holding a **Poisonium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Muk (Alola):** A premiere user that utilizes its STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) Gunk Shot to create a massive 190-Base Power Acid Downpour, capable of deleting most Fairy-type threats instantly.
    * **Toxicroak:** Uses its high physical Attack and STAB Poison Jab to break through bulky Grass or Fairy walls.
    * **Silvally-Poison:** Often uses its signature versatility to deploy a physical Poison nuke in specific tier formats.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently utilized by Physical attackers like **Garchomp** or **Landorus-Therian** (via Poison Jab) as a "Lure" to surprise and OHKO **Tapu Bulu** or **Clefable**, which typically check these Ground-types.
* **Acquisition:** Only available in Generation VII via the **Poisonium Z** crystal, typically obtained after completing the trial of Team Skull Admin Plumeria or found in the Shady House in Po Town.
