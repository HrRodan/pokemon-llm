## Identity & Mechanics
**Charge Beam** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user gathers a concentrated bundle of electrical energy and fires it at the target as a sustained, high-voltage beam. This surge of electricity often lingers, stimulating the user's own power.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage and has a high probability of increasing the user's offensive capabilities.
* **Secondary Effect:** 70% chance to raise the user’s **Special Attack** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 90%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Setup Attacker / Snowball Utility.**
* **Usage:** While its raw power is low compared to staples like *Thunderbolt* or *Thunder*, Charge Beam functions as a hybrid between an attack and a setup move. It is often used to finish off a weakened opponent to "free" a Special Attack boost, turning the user into a late-game sweeper. It is frequently compared to *Calm Mind*; while *Calm Mind* is guaranteed, Charge Beam allows the user to maintain offensive pressure and break *Focus Sashes* while boosting.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a "Beam" move, though it is not currently blocked by specific beam-nullifying abilities (like *Bulletproof*).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very wide** distribution (267 learners), making it one of the most accessible Electric-type coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Magnezone**, **Rotom (all forms)**, **Vikavolt**, and **Miraidon**. **Magnezone** in particular uses it effectively to boost its Special Attack while trapping Steel-type foes.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Electric Pokémon such as **Gholdengo**, **Alakazam**, and **Blissey**. These Pokémon utilize it to threaten Water-types like *Pelipper* or *Dondozo* while simultaneously increasing their own threat level.
* **Acquisition:** Charge Beam is widely available as a **TM** (traditionally TM57 or TM023) across most generations, including Diamond/Pearl/Platinum and Scarlet/Violet.
