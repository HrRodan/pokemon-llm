## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Blast** is a physical Shadow-type move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically appearing in the GameCube title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user releases a wicked surge of shadowy energy, channeling the darkness within its closed heart to strike the opponent with a malevolent shockwave. This move represents the peak of a Shadow Pokémon's offensive power, manifesting as a dark purple aura or beam that ruptures the target's defenses.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. This move possesses an increased critical hit ratio (+1 stage), making it more likely to bypass the target's defensive stat stages or Screens.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, but benefits from the high critical hit rate mechanic.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP -- (N/A).
* **Role:** **Reliable Shadow STAB** / **Consistency Option**.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD*, Shadow Blast is one of the most efficient Shadow-type moves. While *Shadow End* has higher raw power, it inflicts heavy recoil; Shadow Blast offers high reliability and a crit-chance ceiling without any drawbacks. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **all non-Shadow Pokémon** and is **Not Very Effective** against other **Shadow Pokémon**. 
* **Attributes:** High Critical Hit Ratio.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **narrow** distribution, restricted exclusively to Shadow Pokémon encountered in the Orre region.
* **Prominent Users:** The most iconic user is **Shadow Lugia (Codename: XD001)**, which uses this move as its signature offensive tool. It is also utilized by powerful Shadow variants of **Salamence**, **Snorlax**, and **Lapras** in the late-game of *Pokémon XD*.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Shadow moves are "Type-less" in terms of traditional elemental matchups (hitting everything for super-effective damage in *Gale of Darkness*), this move provides universal neutral coverage against the entire non-shadow roster.
* **Acquisition:** This move cannot be taught via TM/TR or Move Tutor; it is hardcoded into the move-sets of specific Shadow Pokémon until they are purified, at which point the move is replaced by a standard move (Shadow Blast often converts to *Aeroblast* for Lugia).
