## Identity & Mechanics
**Pounce** is a physical Bug-type move introduced in **Generation IX** (Pokémon Scarlet & Violet).
* **Description:** The user leaps through the air and strikes the target with its full body weight, momentarily pinning or jarring them. This kinetic impact is specifically designed to hinder the target's mobility, making it a reliable tool for early-game progression and tactical speed control.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and **guarantees** a reduction in the target's Speed stat.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the target’s **Speed** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 50, Accuracy 100%, PP 20.
* **Role:** **Utility Attacker / Speed Control.**
* **Usage:** Pounce functions as the Bug-type equivalent to moves like *Bulldoze* or *Icy Wind*. While its base power is too low for it to serve as a primary "nuke," it is an excellent "Check" against faster threats, allowing the user (or a teammate) to outspeed the opponent on the following turn. It is often preferred in VGC (Doubles) or during the main story playthrough to mitigate the Speed of dangerous sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **wide** distribution (89 learners), appearing frequently among insectoid and predatory Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic Bug-types such as **Scizor**, **Kleavor**, and the Gen IX signature Bug/Dark threat **Lokix** utilize this move effectively. It is also a staple for **Scyther** and **Heracross**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Surprisingly found on high-tier non-Bug Pokémon such as **Dragapult**, **Toxapex**, and **Mew**, who can use it to provide speed control or chip away at Dark and Psychic types.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available as **TM021** in the Paldea region, making it accessible to a massive variety of Pokémon early in the game.
