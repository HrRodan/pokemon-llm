## Identity & Mechanics
**Flying Press** is a Physical Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** Drawing inspiration from professional wrestling, the user leaps into the air and dives onto the opponent with full body weight. This aerial maneuver is uniquely flavored as a "luchador" style attack, characterized by its dual-elemental nature. It is the only move in the franchise that calculates damage based on two types simultaneously.
* **Effect:** While categorized as a Fighting-type move for STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) and damage boosts, it calculates effectiveness as both a **Fighting- and Flying-type** move. The effectiveness is determined by multiplying the modifiers of both types against the target’s type(s). 
* **Secondary Effect:** If the target has used **Minimize**, Flying Press bypasses accuracy checks to never miss and deals **double damage** (200 Base Power).
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 100, Accuracy 95%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Signature Wallbreaker / Specialized STAB.
* **Usage:** Flying Press is a high-risk, high-reward move because its dual-typing creates unique offensive coverage and strange resistances. It is technically more accurate than High Jump Kick and lacks the recoil of Brave Bird. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Normal, Ice, Rock, Dark, Steel, Grass, Bug, and Fighting** types, provided the secondary type does not resist one of the components. However, it is uniquely resisted by types like Electric, Poison, and Fairy, which usually don't resist Fighting-type moves.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Despite its aerial flavor, it is not considered a "wind" move but is subject to gravity.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution, being the signature move of a specific evolutionary line and special event forms (2 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Hawlucha**, who gains STAB from the Fighting-type designation and perfectly fits the "Wrestling" theme. 
* **Special Users:** It is also used by **Pikachu-Libre**, a specific Cosplay Pikachu variant from Omega Ruby, Alpha Sapphire, and the Pokkén Tournament crossover.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not found on non-STAB users. It cannot be taught via **TM/TR** or Move Tutor to other Pokémon, making it one of the most exclusive offensive moves in the competitive meta.
* **Acquisition:** Learned naturally by Hawlucha upon leveling up or through the Move Relearner; Pikachu-Libre knows it by default in its specific costume.
