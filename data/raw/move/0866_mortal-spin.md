## Identity & Mechanics
**Mortal Spin** is a physical Poison-type move introduced in **Generation IX (Paldea)**.
* **Description:** The user releases toxic secretions while spinning with high centrifugal force, striking all adjacent foes. This rapid rotation generates enough force to physically blow away binding traps, parasitic seeds, and entry hazards, while simultaneously contaminating targets with a potent toxin.
* **Effect:** A multifunctional utility move that removes the effects of trapping moves (e.g., Bind, Wrap, Clamp, Fire Spin), clears **Leech Seed**, and eliminates entry hazards (e.g., **Stealth Rock, Spikes, Toxic Spikes, Sticky Web**) from the user’s side of the field.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **100% chance** to inflict the **Poison** status condition on all targets hit.
* **Targeting:** Hits **all adjacent opponents** (Spread move in Double Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 30, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** **Utility / Hazard Removal / Status Spreader**.
* **Usage:** Mortal Spin is a direct upgrade to *Rapid Spin* in terms of utility, though it lacks the Speed-boosting side effect. Its primary value lies in its **guaranteed status spread**; unlike most hazard removal, it forces progress by poisoning the opponent. Because it is an attacking move, it cannot be blocked by *Taunt*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass** and **Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Static. As a Poison-type move, it cannot poison Steel or other Poison-type Pokémon.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution, currently serving as a **Signature Move**.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Glimmora**. It is a cornerstone of Glimmora’s kit, allowing it to act as both a hazard setter (via its *Toxic Debris* ability) and a hazard remover (via Mortal Spin).
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no other Pokémon can learn this move, making Glimmora a unique "Anti-Hazard" lead in the competitive metagame. 
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it must be learned naturally by Glimmet/Glimmora.
