## Identity & Mechanics
**Dire Claw** is a Physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user licks or slashes the target with ruinous, toxic claws infused with volatile energy. This move is designed to exploit vital points for critical hits while simultaneously secreting toxins that can disrupt the target's nervous system or consciousness.
* **Effect:** Deals damage with an increased critical-hit ratio (+1 stage). 
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a massive **50% chance** to inflict either **Poison, Paralysis, or Sleep** (Drowsy in Legends: Arceus) on the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 15.
* **Role:** Status Spreader / RNG-Based Breaker.
* **Usage:** While its base power is comparable to *Poison Jab*, Dire Claw is significantly more dangerous due to its 50% secondary effect rate. In competitive formats like Smogon OU, it is considered one of the most "uncompetitive" or polarizing moves because a single use has a high probability of neutralizing a check via Sleep or Paralysis. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy** and **Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet. Despite being a "claw" move, it is not currently boosted by the Tough Claws ability since its users do not possess it.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very narrow distribution (1 learner), as it is the **Signature Move** of the Sneasel-Hisui evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Sneasler**. It is the cornerstone of Sneasler’s offensive pressure, allowing it to fish for status against switch-ins.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is a signature move, it is not found as coverage on other Pokémon. However, Sneasler uses it to force progress against bulky **Fairy** types such as **Clefable** or **Enamorus**, often winning matchups it otherwise shouldn't through the 50% status proc.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR. It can only be learned by Sneasler upon evolution or via the Move Tutor in the Hisui region.
