## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Down** is a **Status Shadow-type** move introduced in **Generation III**, specifically within the GameCube title *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*.
* **Description:** The user releases a chilling, dark aura that permeates the battlefield, suppressing the defensive instincts of the opposition. This spectral pressure causes the targets to become physically brittle and vulnerable. As a Shadow move, it is exclusive to "Shadow Pokémon"—creatures whose hearts have been artificially closed.
* **Effect:** Harshly lowers the **Defense** stat of all targets on the opposing field by **two stages** (-2 Defense). 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to apply the stat reduction).
* **Targeting:** Opponents' Field (Hits both foes in a Double Battle).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 100%, PP — (N/A for Shadow Moves).
* **Role:** Utility / Defense Debuffer.
* **Usage:** Within the context of *Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness*, Shadow Down acts as a strictly superior version of *Screech*. While *Screech* has 85% accuracy and typically hits a single target, Shadow Down is **perfectly accurate** and provides **spread pressure** by hitting both opponents simultaneously. It is primarily used to set up a "Physical Sweep," allowing a physical attacker partner to OHKO (One-Hit Knockout) bulky threats that have had their Defense halved. 
* **Type Matchups:** As a Shadow-type status move, it bypasses traditional type immunities inherent to standard types, though Shadow moves deal "Not Very Effective" damage/effect to other Shadow Pokémon.
* **Attributes:** Field-wide effect; bypasses accuracy checks that would affect moves like *Screech* or *Leer*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution, restricted entirely to Shadow Pokémon encountered in the Orre Region. It cannot be learned via leveling, TM, or Breeding in any handheld core-series game.
* **Prominent Users:** Most notably utilized by **Shadow Teddiursa** (the first Shadow Pokémon obtained in *XD*), **Shadow Meowth**, **Shadow Spinarak**, and **Shadow Pineco**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Shadow moves are "purified" away to allow for transfer to the GBA/DS games, this move has **zero availability** in standard VGC or Smogon competitive formats. It exists purely as a mid-game utility tool for players during the *XD* campaign to soften up bosses.
* **Acquisition:** Exclusive to specific Shadow Pokémon upon capture; the move is automatically replaced or lost once the Pokémon undergoes the Purification process.
