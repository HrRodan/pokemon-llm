## Identity & Mechanics
**Max Wyrmwind** is a [Damage Class] (variable) **Dragon**-type move introduced in **Generation VIII**.
* **Description:** A colossal manifestation of draconic energy used exclusively by Dynamaxed Pokémon. The user exhales or unleashes a swirling, violet-hued cyclone of primal power that engulfs the battlefield. This move is designed to not only crush the opponent with immense force but also to intimidate them, sap their physical strength, and suppress their offensive momentum.
* **Effect:** Inflicts damage based on the power of the base move. It bypasses accuracy checks to always hit (unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Dig or Fly). It also pierces **Protect** and similar moves, dealing 25% of its total damage.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to **lower the target's (and their ally's in doubles) Attack stat by one stage**.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target), but the secondary stat drop affects all adjacent opponents in Double Battles.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies: 100–150], Accuracy [—]%, PP [10].
* **Role:** **Stat-Lowering Nuke** / **Anti-Physical Utility**.
* **Usage:** In the Generation VIII competitive meta (VGC and Smogon), Max Wyrmwind served as a premier defensive-offensive hybrid tool. By dealing massive damage while simultaneously lowering the opponent's Attack, it allowed the user to "bulk up" against physical threats like Zacian-C or Landorus-T. It is the Dragon-type counterpart to Max Knuckle or Max Ooze, but focuses on debilitating the opponent rather than boosting the user. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Dragon** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses Accuracy/Evasion; Damage category (Physical or Special) is determined by the base move it is derived from.

## Distribution & Notable Users
This move is available to **any Pokémon** that knows a damaging Dragon-type move while it is **Dynamaxed**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Dragapult:** Often used its high Speed and STAB (via Dragon Dart or Draco Meteor) to land a Max Wyrmwind early, neutering opposing physical attackers.
    * **Rayquaza:** In restricted formats, its massive offensive stats made its Max Wyrmwind a terrifying "Wallbreaker" that also patched up its team's physical defenses.
    * **Dialga & Palkia:** Frequently utilized in VGC to control the board and mitigate damage from physical behemoths.
* **Coverage Utility:** Often seen on non-Dragon Pokémon like **Tyranitar**, **Garchomp**, or **Gyarados** (when carrying Outrage or Dragon Pulse) specifically to provide "Intimidate-like" utility through the Attack drop while maintaining high damage output.
* **Acquisition:** Exclusively available during **Dynamax/Gigantamax** state in the Galar region; the power is determined by the underlying TM, TR, or Egg Move (such as Outrage, Dragon Claw, or Draco Meteor).
