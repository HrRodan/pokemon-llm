## Identity & Mechanics
**Barb Barrage** is a physical Poison-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically debuted in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user unleashes a relentless volley of venom-drenched spikes and toxic barbs at the opponent. This projectile-based attack is designed to puncture defenses and infect the target’s bloodstream, making it a signature offensive tool for needle-covered aquatic predators.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and has a high chance to poison the target. The move's base power **doubles from 60 to 120** if the target is already afflicted with a status condition (Poison, Paralysis, Burn, Sleep, or Freeze).
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to **Poison** the target.
* **Targeting:** Selected single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 60 (120 if status is present), Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** **Condition-Punishing Nuke** / Snowball Physical STAB.
* **Usage:** Barb Barrage is the physical counterpart to *Venoshock* or *Hex*, but it is significantly more dangerous because its 50% secondary effect chance allows it to "set up" its own power boost. In a single turn, it can poison a foe and immediately threaten a 120 BP STAB nuke on the following turn. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fairy** and **Grass** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite being a "barrage" of spikes, it is **not** a contact move, allowing the user to bypass effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or Flame Body. It is also categorized as a "ball/bomb" move in some contexts, though primarily it functions as a standard physical projectile.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (3 total learners), serving as the signature move for the Qwilfish evolutionary line.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Overqwil** and **Hisuian Qwilfish**, who rely on it as their primary STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move to pressure Fairy-type walls.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, this move is not found on non-Poison types, as it is biologically tied to the "Quill" morphology of the Qwilfish family. It is essential for Overqwil to check threats like **Primarina**, **Enamorus**, or **Rillaboom**.
* **Acquisition:** It is a **signature move** learned via leveling up; it is not available as a TM or TR, making it an exclusive tactical advantage for its specific users.
