## Identity & Mechanics
**Bind** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user physically constricts the target using its body, vines, tentacles, or long appendages. This squeeze prevents the target from retreating while inflicting continuous residual damage over several turns, effectively "locking" the opponent into the current matchup.
* **Effect:** Inflicts initial damage and traps the target for 2–5 turns. During this period, the target cannot switch out or flee and loses 1/16th (6.25%) of its maximum HP at the end of each turn. The trapping effect ends if the user leaves the field or if the target uses **Rapid Spin**.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to apply the **Trapping** status condition upon a successful hit.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15, Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Utility / Trapping / Passive Damage.
* **Usage:** While its raw damage is negligible, Bind is utilized for its **anti-switching** properties. It is a niche tool in "Stall" or "Perish Trap" compositions, allowing a player to prevent a counter-switch while the opponent's HP is whittled down by status conditions like Poison or Burn. It is generally outclassed by **Magma Storm** (higher damage) or **Spider Web/Block** (guaranteed accuracy), but serves as a generic trapping option for many serpentine or tentacled Pokémon.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is completely resisted by **Ghost** types and resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**. It cannot deal Super Effective damage to any type.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, triggering abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a moderately wide distribution (86 learners), primarily found on Pokémon with elongated or flexible anatomies.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by **Onix/Steelix**, **Serperior**, **Tentacruel**, and **Zygarde**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Malamar** or **Grapploct** to force favorable matchups or prevent a target from escaping a stat-dropping or octolocking strategy.
* **Acquisition:** Originally available as **TM32** in Generation I; in modern generations, it is primarily learned via level-up by serpentine, plant-based, or aquatic Pokémon.
