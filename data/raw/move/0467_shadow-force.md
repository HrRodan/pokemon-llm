## Identity & Mechanics
**Shadow Force** is a Physical Ghost-type signature move introduced in **Generation IV (Sinnoh)**.
* **Description:** The user dissolves into shadows or slips into a parallel dimension, vanishing instantly from the battlefield to evade incoming attacks. On the following turn, the user materializes behind the target to deliver a devastating, spectral ambush. This move represents the ultimate mastery over the Distortion World, channeling dark energy that no physical or magical barrier can withstand.
* **Effect:** This is a two-turn move. On the first turn, the user enters a semi-invulnerable "vanished" state, becoming immune to most moves. On the second turn, it deals damage. Crucially, this move **ignores and breaks the effects of Protection moves** (such as Protect, Detect, King's Shield, and Baneful Bunker).
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to hit on the second turn).
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke** / **Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Shadow Force is the strongest Physical Ghost-type move in existence. While two-turn moves are typically easy to exploit, Shadow Force is unique because it cannot be stalled by **Protect**, which is the standard counter to moves like Fly or Dig. It is primarily used to force switches or to punish defensive Pokémon trying to scout the user's set. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ghost** and **Psychic** types.
* **Attributes:** Makes **Contact**. This move cannot be selected by **Sleep Talk**, preventing it from being used effectively by "Sleep Talker" sets.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely **Narrow** distribution (2 primary learners), as it is the signature move of the Renegade Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Almost exclusively utilized by **Giratina-Altered** and **Giratina-Origin**. It is a staple for Physical or Mixed Giratina sets in the Ubers tier.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a coverage move for other Pokémon, **Arceus-Ghost** has been known to utilize the move in specific event distributions or via the Spooky Plate to bypass an opponent's protection in high-level competitive play.
* **Acquisition:** Only available via level-up for Giratina; it is not available as a **TM/TR** or Move Tutor for the general population of Pokémon.
