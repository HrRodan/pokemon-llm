## Identity & Mechanics
**Techno Blast** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation V (Unova).
* **Description:** The user discharges a concentrated beam of high-tech, synthetic energy from its cannon. While naturally appearing as a blinding white light, the beam's color and elemental properties shift instantaneously based on the internal circuitry and hardware (Drives) installed on the user.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage. The move's type changes depending on the **Drive** item held by the user. If no Drive is held, it remains a Normal-type move. 
    * **Burn Drive:** Becomes Fire-type.
    * **Chill Drive:** Becomes Ice-type.
    * **Douse Drive:** Becomes Water-type.
    * **Shock Drive:** Becomes Electric-type.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 120, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** High-Power Variable Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Techno Blast is a high-risk, high-reward signature move. While its base power is immense (surpassing standard coverage like Thunderbolt or Flamethrower), its **severely limited PP** makes it susceptible to Pressure stalling. It is primarily used to lure in and OHKO specific counters; for example, a **Douse Drive** allows the user to delete Fire-type checks like Heatran, while a **Chill Drive** provides a powerful 120-power Ice-type nuke to ground 4x weak Dragons.
* **Matchups:** Depending on the Drive, it deals **Super Effective** damage to:
    * **Base (Normal):** N/A (resisted by Rock, Steel; nullified by Ghost).
    * **Fire:** Steel, Bug, Ice, Grass.
    * **Ice:** Dragon, Flying, Ground, Grass.
    * **Water:** Fire, Ground, Rock.
    * **Electric:** Water, Flying.
* **Attributes:** Pulse-like beam (though not technically a "Pulse" move for Mega Launcher).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, as it is a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Genesect**. The move was designed to showcase the "Paleozoic Pokémon's" cybernetic enhancements by Team Plasma.
* **Coverage Utility:** Because Genesect is a Bug/Steel type, Techno Blast never gains STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) unless used in its base Normal form. However, its 120 base power is high enough that it often outperforms traditional STAB moves when hitting for super-effective damage.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned naturally by Genesect upon leveling up.
