## Identity & Mechanics
**Breakneck Blitz (Physical)** is a Physical Normal-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII (Alola)**.
* **Description:** The user harnesses the raw kinetic energy of Z-Power, building immense momentum before crashing into the target at terminal velocity. This move represents the ultimate manifestation of physical force, manifesting as a high-speed collision that ignores traditional evasion tactics.
* **Effect:** This move is a **Z-Move** upgraded from a base physical Normal-type move using a **Normalium Z** crystal. Its base power scales according to the original move (e.g., Giga Impact creates a 200 BP nuke, while Tackle creates a 100 BP hit). It bypasses accuracy checks and penetrates **Protect/Detect**, dealing 25% of its total damage through shields.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Standard Z-Move).
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **Physical Wallbreaker / High-Risk Nuke.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in Generation VII competitive formats to bypass an opponent's defensive checks or to secure a "one-shot" KO on a bulky neutral threat. Unlike elemental Z-moves, it deals **Neutral Damage** to almost every type (except Rock and Steel) and is completely resisted only by Ghost-types. It is often used as a catch-all offensive option for physical attackers lacking specialized coverage.
* **Type Matchups:** It deals **Super Effective** damage to **None** (Normal type). It is **Resisted** by Rock and Steel types and has **No Effect** on Ghost types.
* **Attributes:** Sure-hit (bypasses accuracy/evasion), Z-Move mechanics.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Universal** distribution among Pokémon that can learn any Physical Normal-type move and hold a **Normalium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Snorlax:** Frequently utilizes this (or its signature variant) to leverage its massive Attack stat into a game-ending nuke using *Giga Impact* or *Double-Edge* as a base.
    * **Diggersby:** Uses its *Huge Power* ability to turn Breakneck Blitz into one of the hardest-hitting neutral attacks in the game.
    * **Silvally:** Often employs this to maximize its STAB potential in lower tiers.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on physical flyers like **Landorus-Therian** or **Salamence** (using *Double-Edge* or *Facade*) to provide a high-damage neutral hit against targets that resist their primary STAB.
* **Acquisition:** This move is not learned through leveling or TMs, but is granted exclusively via the **Normalium Z** Crystal in Generation VII games (Sun/Moon/Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon).
