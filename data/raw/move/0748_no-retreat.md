## Identity & Mechanics
**No Retreat** is a Status Fighting-type move introduced in Generation VIII (Galar region).
* **Description:** The user demonstrates its resolve by sealing off its own escape to focus entirely on the battle. This tactical maneuver results in an **Omniboost**, raising the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed stats by one stage each. However, the determination is so absolute that the user is prevented from switching out or fleeing for the remainder of its time on the field.
* **Effect:** Raises Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage (+1). It also applies the "No Retreat" status to the user, preventing manual switching or the use of moves like U-turn/Volt Switch.
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Status Move).
* **Targeting:** Affects the user only.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy — %, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **Setup Sweeper / Win Condition.**
* **Usage:** As a rare "Omniboost" move, No Retreat is designed to turn a Pokémon into a lethal threat in a single turn. While it lacks the raw offensive scaling of *Shell Smash*, the boost to both defensive stats makes the user much harder to revenge kill. The primary drawback is the **self-trapping mechanic**, which means the user cannot escape a bad matchup (such as a Ghost-type or a dedicated Wall) once the move is used. It is often paired with a **White Herb** to offset any initial stat drops or **Eject Button/Pack** strategies, though the latter can be tricky with the move's trapping effect.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Signature Move**. It cannot be used more than once per time the user is on the field (unless the user switches out via an item or move that ignores trapping).

## Distribution & Notable Users
No Retreat has an extremely narrow distribution, serving as a signature move for a specific Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively learned by **Falinks**. 
* **Competitive Context:** On **Falinks**, this move defines its entire niche in lower competitive tiers (like PU or NU). The strategy usually involves finding a "free" turn against a physical attacker, using No Retreat to bulk up, and then attempting to sweep with moves like *Close Combat*, *Iron Head*, or *Throat Chop*.
* **Coverage Utility:** While it provides no direct coverage, the +1 boost to Speed and Special Attack allows Falinks to occasionally run mixed sets or better utilize its physical movepool to break through traditional counters.
* **Acquisition:** This is a natural level-up move for Falinks and is not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to any other species.
