## Identity & Mechanics
**Thunder Shock** is a Special Electric-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user releases a mild jolt of electricity to strike the target. This low-voltage discharge manifests as a quick spark or localized bolt intended to stun the opponent. In a retrieval context, it serves as the foundational Electric-type offensive move, often characterized by its high reliability and potential for status infliction.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** Has a **10%** chance to **Paralyze** the target, reducing their Speed and potentially preventing them from acting.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** In a competitive environment, Thunder Shock is considered a "niche starter move" and is almost universally outclassed by **Thunderbolt** (for raw power) or **Discharge** (for a higher 30% paralysis rate). Its primary use is during the early leveling stages of a playthrough. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by most defensive abilities like Iron Barbs or Rough Skin, but blocked by **Volt Absorb**, **Lightning Rod**, and **Motor Drive**.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (89 learners), primarily consisting of pure Electric-type Pokémon and regional variants.
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature early-game move for **Pikachu**, and is also learned by legendary Pokémon such as **Zapdos**, **Raikou**, and the speed-demon **Regieleki**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on unconventional Pokémon like **Alolan Golem** (as a STAB option via Galvanize) or **Stunfisk** and **Melmetal** during their lower-level movepools.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via **Level-up**; it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, as it is intended to be replaced by more powerful Electric-type maneuvers as the Pokémon grows.
