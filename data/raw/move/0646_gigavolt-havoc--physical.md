## Identity & Mechanics
**Gigavolt Havoc (Physical)** is a Physical Electric-type Z-Move introduced in Generation VII (Alola).
* **Description:** The user channeled its Z-Power through an Electrium Z crystal, surrounding itself in a high-voltage aura before striking the target with an overwhelming surge of lightning and kinetic force. This move manifests as a cinematic limit-break attack, representing the pinnacle of Electric-type physical prowess.
* **Effect:** This is a one-time use Z-Move. Its power is determined by the base physical move it upgrades from (e.g., Wild Charge or Bolt Strike). It bypasses accuracy checks to hit the target guaranteed, unless the target is in a semi-invulnerable state like Fly or Dig.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Standard Z-Moves do not carry the secondary effects of their base moves).
* **Targeting:** Selected Single Pokémon.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Variable: 100–210], Accuracy [—]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the Generation VII meta to secure OHKOs on bulky threats that could otherwise survive a standard hit. Unlike the Special version, the Physical version is often used to circumvent the recoil damage of *Wild Charge* for one turn or to provide a massive, 100% accurate strike for users of the high-power but slightly inaccurate *Bolt Strike*. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water** and **Flying** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; ignores Protect/Detect partially (dealing 25% chip damage through shields).

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Wide** distribution, as any Pokémon capable of learning a Physical Electric-type move can utilize it while holding an Electrium Z.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Tapu Koko:** The premier user in Alola, often using this to turn *Wild Charge* into a massive nuke to breakthrough specially defensive walls.
    * **Zekrom:** In Ubers, it transforms its signature *Bolt Strike* into a 210-Base Power catastrophe that few Pokémon can switch into safely.
    * **Alolan Raichu:** Occasionally utilizes a physical set with *Wild Charge* to surprise opponents expecting a special attacker.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on physical attackers with diverse movepools like **Garchomp** or **Tyranitar** (running *Thunder Punch*) to lure and eliminate Water-type counters like Tapu Fini or Toxapex.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Electrium Z** Crystal, found in the Vast Poni Canyon or obtained from Sophocles in the Alola region.
