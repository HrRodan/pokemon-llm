## Identity & Mechanics
**Celebrate** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The Pokémon expresses immense joy and festive spirit to congratulate the Trainer on a special occasion, such as a birthday or anniversary. Visually, the move often involves the user jumping in delight while confetti, streamers, or fireworks appear on screen, making it a purely celebratory, event-exclusive gesture.
* **Effect:** Under normal circumstances, this move has no effect in battle; it simply displays the message: "Congratulations, [Player Name]!" 
* **Secondary Effect:** None (Standard); however, when used as a **Z-Move (Z-Celebrate)** in Generation VII, it grants an **Omniboost**, raising the user's Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed by one stage each.
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 40.
* **Role:** Gimmick / Setup Sweeper (Z-Move context).
* **Usage:** In standard play, Celebrate is non-functional and serves only as a collector's novelty. However, in the Generation VII competitive meta, it functioned as a high-tier **Setup** tool via **Z-Celebrate**. This allowed specific event-distributed Pokémon to become dangerous **Omniboost** sweepers, similar to moves like *Ancient Power* (procedural) or *Clangorous Soulblaze*. It is frequently compared to **Happy Hour** and **Hold Hands**, which share its event-only status and lack of primary battle effect.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; not a contact move; unaffected by Protect (as it targets the user).

## Distribution & Notable Users
Celebrate has an extremely narrow distribution, restricted entirely to special **Event Distributions** (Total learners: <10).
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously associated with event-only **Pikachu** and **Eevee** distributions. It was also notably distributed on a special **Victini** and a Japanese **Rayquaza** (the "NHk" event).
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a coverage move, it is used by **Victini** in specific formats to trigger its Z-Move boost, allowing it to bypass its usual stat-lowering tendencies from *V-create*.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It can only be obtained if the Pokémon is caught or received with the move already in its set.
