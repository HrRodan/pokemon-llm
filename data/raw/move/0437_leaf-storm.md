## Identity & Mechanics
**Leaf Storm** is a high-intensity Special Grass-type move introduced in Generation IV (Sinnoh region).
* **Description:** The user summons a violent, swirling vortex of razor-sharp leaves and botanical debris to shred the target. This overwhelming release of energy is physically and mentally taxing, resulting in a significant momentary depletion of the user's offensive power. It is the Grass-type equivalent of powerful moves like Overheat, Draco Meteor, and Psycho Boost.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage on a single target, but the resulting recoil "sharply lowers" the user's Special Attack stat by two stages (-2 Sp. Atk) immediately after use.
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to trigger the Special Attack drop on the user.
* **Targeting:** Selected single opponent.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 130, Accuracy 90%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker**.
* **Usage:** Leaf Storm is the premier "hit-and-run" move for Special Grass-type attackers. Due to the severe Special Attack drop, it is typically used to secure a One-Hit Knockout (OHKO) or to deal massive chip damage before switching out (**Pivoting**) to reset stats. It is often preferred over *Energy Ball* or *Giga Drain* when immediate raw power is needed to breakthrough defensive walls. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** Not a contact move; unaffected by Iron Barbs or Rocky Helmet. It is a "Wind" move in later generations, interacting with abilities like Wind Power or Wind Rider.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution among Grass-type Pokémon (116 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Serperior:** Famously utilizes the **Contrary** ability to turn the Sp. Atk drop into a +2 boost, transforming Leaf Storm into a terrifying setup tool.
    * **Sceptile (Mega):** Uses its high Speed and STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) to function as a powerful late-game cleaner.
    * **Rotom-Mow:** Frequently carries the move as its primary STAB option in a Choice Specs or Choice Scarf set to pivot in and out of combat.
    * **Venusaur:** Often runs Leaf Storm on offensive Sun-weather teams to maximize immediate damage output.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Mythical Pokémon like **Celebi** or **Shaymin-Sky** to provide high-pressure offensive presence against bulky Water-types like Dondozo or Great Tusk.
* **Acquisition:** It is widely available via **TM/TR** in recent generations (including TM159 in Scarlet & Violet), making it accessible to nearly every fully evolved Special Grass-type attacker.
