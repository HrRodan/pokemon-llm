## Identity & Mechanics
**Assist** is a Status Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user calls upon its allies for aid, randomly performing a move known by another Pokémon in the player's party. This collaborative technique allows the user to tap into the party's collective movepool, channeling the energy of teammates—even those that have already fainted—to execute an unpredictable attack or utility maneuver.
* **Effect:** Randomly selects and executes a move from the user's current party members. It fails if no moves are available or if the party consists only of the user. It cannot call high-stakes or complex moves such as *Metronome, Mirror Move, Protect, Focus Punch, Dragon Tail, Circle Throw,* or *Destiny Bond*.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (though the move successfully called by Assist may have its own secondary effects).
* **Targeting:** User (the resulting move then targets based on its own properties).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [None], Accuracy [None]%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Wildcard Utility / Gimmick Setup.
* **Usage:** Historically, Assist was the centerpiece of "Assist Strategies," where a team was constructed with only one "legal" move for Assist to call (such as **Spore** or **Dragon Tail**). When paired with the Ability **Prankster**, users could fire off 100% accurate sleep moves or forced switches with increased priority. In modern generations, its viability has vanished as the move has been cut from many recent titles.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type status move, it is blocked by **Ghost** types if the resulting move is a damaging Normal-type attack.
* **Attributes:** This move is not a contact move, but the move it calls may be. It is bypassed by *Magic Coat* and *Magic Bounce* depending on the called effect.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a narrow distribution (13 total learners), almost exclusively limited to feline Pokémon and mischievous archetypes.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously utilized by **Liepard** and **Purrloin** due to their access to the *Prankster* ability. Other iconic users include **Meowth/Persian**, **Delcatty (Skitty)**, and **Purugly**.
* **Coverage Utility:** While not a coverage move in the traditional sense, **Liepard** frequently used Assist to access "illegal" coverage or status, such as calling **Spore** from a Smeargle teammate to shut down counters.
* **Acquisition:** Assist is notably rare; it has never been a TM or TR, making it a "Level-up only" signature-style move for specific evolutionary lines.
