## Identity & Mechanics
**Leech Life** is a Physical Bug-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user sinks its fangs, claws, or proboscis into the target to siphon away their vital essence. This vampiric strike converts the target's life force into restorative energy for the user, allowing them to remain in the fray longer while dealing significant damage.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and restores the user's HP by 50% of the damage dealt to the target.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to trigger the healing effect upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Sustain-Based Offense / Reliable STAB.
* **Usage:** Historically a weak move (20 BP), it received a massive buff in Generation VII, making it the premier Physical Bug-type STAB. It is almost strictly superior to **X-Scissor** because it shares the same base power but adds significant longevity. It competes with **U-turn** for a moveset slot; while U-turn provides pivoting, Leech Life provides the "staying power" necessary for bulky attackers and setup sweepers. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Psychic, and Dark** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a wide distribution (84 learners), particularly among insectoid, nocturnal, and predatory Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** It is a cornerstone move for **Buzzwole**, **Golisopod**, and **Lokix**, who use their high Attack stats to maximize the HP recovered. It is also a staple for **Araquanid** and **Crobat**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Bug Pokémon such as **Incineroar**, **Grimmsnarl**, and **Dracovish**. In competitive VGC, Incineroar occasionally carries it to hit Dark and Grass types while maintaining its own HP.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** (TM28 in Gen 7, TR18 in Gen 8, TM095 in Gen 9), making it accessible to a vast array of physical attackers.
