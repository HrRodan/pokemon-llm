## Identity & Mechanics
**Dark Void** is a status Dark-type move introduced in Generation IV.
* **Description:** The user creates a localized vacuum of pure shadow, dragging opposing Pokémon into a realm of total, suffocating darkness. This supernatural void induces a deep, nightmare-filled slumber, effectively neutralizing threats by forcing them into the Sleep status condition.
* **Effect:** Puts the target to sleep. In Double Battles and Triple Battles, this move targets all adjacent opponents simultaneously.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (100% chance to induce Sleep upon successful hit).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Multi-target in Doubles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy 50%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Crowd Control / Status Utility.
* **Usage:** Historically, Dark Void was a "High-Risk, High-Reward" spread status move. In Generations IV through VI, it possessed an 80% accuracy, making it one of the most oppressive moves in VGC (Doubles) formats. However, as of Generation VII, its accuracy was nerfed to 50% and a strict hard-code was implemented: **the move will fail if used by any Pokémon other than Darkrai.** It is used to shut down multiple threats at once, though its current low accuracy makes it less reliable than other sleep-inducing moves like *Spore* or *Sleep Powder*.
* **Context:** Compared to **Spore** (100% accuracy, single target, blocked by Grass-types/Overcoat), Dark Void has the advantage of hitting multiple targets and bypassing "Powder" immunities, but suffers from significantly lower reliability.
* **Attributes:** Magic Coat/Magic Bounce can reflect the move; it is blocked by abilities like Insomnia, Vital Spirit, and Sweet Veil.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution, being the **Signature Move** of a Mythical Pokémon (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Darkrai**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** In previous generations (Gen 4-6), **Smeargle** was a notorious user of Dark Void via *Sketch*, utilizing it to put both opponents to sleep in competitive Doubles. This strategy was so dominant it led to the move being restricted in Gen 7 so that only Darkrai can successfully execute it.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor; it is learned by Darkrai upon leveling up or via special Event distributions.
