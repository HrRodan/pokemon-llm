## Identity & Mechanics
**Bullet Seed** is a Physical Grass-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user forcefully shoots a rapid-fire volley of 2 to 5 high-velocity seeds at the target. This botanical bombardment is designed to overwhelm the opponent through sheer volume, resembling a burst from a machine gun. In competitive environments, its multi-strike nature makes it an essential tool for bypassing defensive layers.
* **Effect:** This is a multi-strike move that hits the target 2–5 times in a single turn. It has a 37.5% chance to hit twice, a 37.5% chance to hit three times, a 12.5% chance to hit four times, and a 12.5% chance to hit five times.
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though it effectively bypasses **Focus Sash**, **Sturdy**, and **Substitute** by dealing damage across multiple hits.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 25 (per hit), Accuracy 100%, PP 30.
* **Role:** Multi-Strike Utility / Focus Sash Breaker.
* **Usage:** While its base power seems low, it is a premier choice for Pokémon with the **Technician** ability (boosting each hit to 37.5 power) or **Skill Link** (guaranteed 5 hits for a total of 125 power). It is often preferred over *Seed Bomb* or *Power Whip* on specific sets to break through **Substitutes** or to maximize damage on Pokémon weak to Grass. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Water**, **Ground**, and **Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is categorized as a **Bullet** move; it is blocked by the ability *Bulletproof* (e.g., Chesnaught) but does not make contact, avoiding chip damage from *Rough Skin* or *Rocky Helmet*.
