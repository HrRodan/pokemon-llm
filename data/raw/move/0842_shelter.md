## Identity & Mechanics
**Shelter** is a Status Steel-type move introduced in Generation VIII (specifically *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*).
* **Description:** The user withdraws into its shell or hardens its external coating to the density of iron, creating a nearly impenetrable physical barrier. This process significantly bolsters the user's defensive capabilities while simultaneously making them harder for opponents to target effectively.
* **Effect:** In its debut appearance, Shelter raises the user's defensive stats and grants the "Obscured" status, which increases the likelihood of incoming moves missing. In later iterations (such as *Pokémon Scarlet and Violet*), it functions as a Steel-type equivalent to Acid Armor, sharply raising the user's Defense stat by two stages (+2).
* **Secondary Effect:** N/A (Direct Stat/Status Buff).
* **Targeting:** User.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 0, Accuracy —%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Defensive Setup / Wall-Strengthening.
* **Usage:** Shelter serves as a specialized **Signature Move** for the Hisuian Goodra line. Compared to its rival moves *Iron Defense* and *Acid Armor*, Shelter carries unique thematic weight for Steel-type tanks. It transforms the user into a "Wallbreaker Check," allowing it to withstand powerful physical hits that would otherwise threaten its longevity. Because it is a Status move, it does not deal damage and therefore has no **Super Effective** type matchups, though its Steel typing reinforces the user's identity as a sturdy defensive pivot.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks (Self-target); affected by Taunt and Snatch.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution (3 learners), functioning exclusively as a signature move for a specific regional evolution line.
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Hisuian Goodra**, which leverages its massive Special Defense alongside Shelter’s Defense boost to become a "Mixed Wall." It is also used by **Hisuian Sliggoo** during the leveling process.
* **Coverage Utility:** Due to its status as a signature move, it is not found on non-Steel types or other generic coverage sets. It is the defining survival tool for the Hisuian Goodra line to compensate for its lower base Physical Defense compared to its Special Defense.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; learned exclusively through Leveling Up by the Goomy line in the Hisui region.
