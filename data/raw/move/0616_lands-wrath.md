## Identity & Mechanics
**Land's Wrath** is a Physical Ground-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user taps into the geological spirit of the ecosystem, gathering tectonic energy from the earth's crust to manifest a powerful seismic shockwave. It focuses the raw power of the land into a controlled strike that ripples through the battlefield to crush opponents under shifting soil and rock.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to all adjacent opponents.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (Spread move in Double/Triple Battles).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Reliable Spread STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** In Singles, it is generally outclassed by **Earthquake** due to the latter’s higher Base Power (100). However, in VGC and Double Battles, Land’s Wrath serves as a safer alternative to Earthquake because it damages **only opponents** without harming the user's ally. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Electric, Fire, Poison, Rock, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a **non-contact** physical attack, meaning it does not trigger effects like Rough Skin, Rocky Helmet, or King’s Shield.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **very narrow** distribution (5 specific forms of a single Pokémon).
* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature move of **Zygarde**, utilized across its **10% Forme**, **50% Forme**, and the massive **Complete Forme**.
* **Coverage Utility:** As a signature move, it is not found on non-Ground types. However, its competitive relevance is often overshadowed by Zygarde's other signature move, **Thousand Arrows**, which provides unique utility by hitting Flying-type and Levitate Pokémon.
* **Acquisition:** Extremely limited; it cannot be taught via TM, TR, or Move Tutor to other species, remaining exclusive to the Zygarde evolutionary line.
