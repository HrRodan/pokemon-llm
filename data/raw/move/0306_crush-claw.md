## Identity & Mechanics
**Crush Claw** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation III (Hoenn).
* **Description:** The user rakes the target with razor-sharp, powerful claws, aiming to shred their armor or hide. This slashing attack is designed not just to inflict damage, but to weaken the opponent's physical resilience through sheer force and jagged precision.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage and attempts to compromise the target's physical bulk.
* **Secondary Effect:** 50% chance to lower the target’s **Defense** by one stage.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 75, Accuracy 95%, PP 10.
* **Role:** Utility Wallbreaker / Shield Breaker.
* **Usage:** While its base power is lower than reliable STAB options like *Return* (102 Power) or *Body Slam* (85 Power), Crush Claw is utilized for its high 50% proc rate on Defense drops. This makes it an effective tool for forcing switches or softening up a defensive wall for a teammate. In lower tiers, it acts as a "Shield Breaker" that punishes passive play. It deals **Neutral** damage to most types but is resisted by **Rock** and **Steel**, and **Ghost** types are immune.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rocky Helmet, Rough Skin, or Iron Barbs.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a relatively narrow distribution (31 total learners), primarily limited to Pokémon with prominent claw or talon aesthetics.
* **Prominent Users:** Most famously associated with **Zangoose** (often its signature-style move), **Sandslash**, and **Armaldo**. It is also a notable option for the **Silvally** and **Type: Null** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically seen on **Blaziken** and **Excadrill** as a flavor-based physical option, though often passed over for higher-power STAB moves in high-level competitive play. **Mega Kangaskhan** (in previous generations) could technically utilize this to fish for double Defense drops via Parental Bond.
* **Acquisition:** Crush Claw is not a common TM/TR; it is primarily learned via Leveling Up or through specialized Breeding (Egg Moves) for most of its users.
