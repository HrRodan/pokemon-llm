## Identity & Mechanics
**Aqua Step** is a Physical Water-type move introduced in Generation IX (Paldea).
* **Description:** The user rhythmically toys with the target, executing a series of light, fluid, and elegant dance steps before striking with a concentrated burst of water. This graceful performance generates momentum, allowing the user to flow more quickly across the battlefield. As a dance-based move, it captures the flair of a performer while serving as a lethal offensive tool.
* **Effect:** Deals damage and increases the user's Speed stat by one stage (100% activation rate).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to boost Speed.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 80, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Setup Attacker / Snowball Mechanic.
* **Usage:** Aqua Step is a premium utility-offensive move. While its raw power is slightly lower than *Liquidation* (85) or *Hydro Pump* (110), its guaranteed Speed boost makes it mathematically superior for sweepers. It functions similarly to a Water-type *Flame Charge* but with significantly higher base power, allowing the user to bypass the need for *Dragon Dance* or *Agility* by attacking and setting up simultaneously. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ground, and Rock** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move (triggers Rough Skin/Rocky Helmet) and is classified as a **Dance move**, meaning it can be copied by the Ability *Dancer*.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an **Extremely Narrow** distribution (1 learner), as it is the signature move of the Quaxly evolution line.
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Quaquaval**. It is the cornerstone of Quaquaval's competitive kit, synergizing perfectly with its Hidden Ability, **Moxie**. By using Aqua Step, Quaquaval gains a Speed boost while potentially netting a K.O. to gain an Attack boost, turning it into a terrifying "snowball" sweeper.
* **Coverage Utility:** Currently, no non-Water Pokémon can learn this move, as it is tied to the specific biological and cultural design of the Paldean starter. 
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM/TR; it must be learned by Quaquaval upon evolution or via level-up.
