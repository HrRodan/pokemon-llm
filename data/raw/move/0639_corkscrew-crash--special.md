## Identity & Mechanics
**Corkscrew Crash (Special)** is a Special Steel-type Z-Move introduced in **Generation VII** (Alola).
* **Description:** Acting as the powered-up cinematic manifestation of a Steel-type attack, the user spins with immense centrifugal force, shroud in gleaming metallic energy, and crashes into the target. This specialized version is triggered when a Pokémon uses its **Steelium Z** crystal in conjunction with a base special-category Steel move like Flash Cannon or Doom Desire.
* **Effect:** This move deals massive damage based on the Power of the original move it is derived from. As a Z-Move, it bypasses the standard accuracy check (it cannot miss) and can penetrate protective moves like Protect or Detect, dealing 25% of its total damage through the barrier.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (The move serves as a high-damage offensive burst).
* **Targeting:** Single Target (Selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power [Varies], Accuracy [∞]%, PP 1.
* **Role:** **High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.**
* **Usage:** Primarily used in the Generation VII competitive meta to break through defensive cores or to secure a one-time KO on a threat that would otherwise survive a standard hit. Since it is a Special-type variant, it is specifically designed to capitalize on the High Special Attack stats of its users. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Ice, Rock, and Fairy** types.
* **Attributes:** Z-Move mechanics; ignores accuracy modifiers and evasion; bypasses Protection (reduced damage).

## Distribution & Notable Users
As a Z-Move, this attack is not learned naturally but is accessible to any Pokémon that knows a special Steel-type move while holding a **Steelium Z**.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Magearna:** Often used **Flash Cannon** or **Fleur Cannon** sets; Corkscrew Crash allowed Magearna to blast through Fire or Poison types that resisted its Fairy STAB.
    * **Lucario (Special):** Utilizing **Flash Cannon**, Special Lucario could use this to delete bulky Fairy-types or neutral targets after a Nasty Plot boost.
    * **Dialga:** In Ubers, a Steelium Z set allows Dialga to turn **Flash Cannon** into a massive nuke to pressure Xerneas or Arceus-Fairy.
* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on Pokémon like **Genesect** or **Celesteela** to provide a high-power Special burst when their standard moves lack the necessary "oomph" to secure a clean OHKO.
* **Acquisition:** Requires the **Steelium Z** crystal, found in the Hokulani Observatory in the Alola region. It is not available in generations following the removal of Z-Move mechanics (Gen VIII onwards).
