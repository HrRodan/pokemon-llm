## Identity & Mechanics
**Hyper Voice** is a Special Normal-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user lets out a deafening, high-pitched shout that reverberates across the battlefield. This sonic resonance creates intense vibrations and powerful sound waves that strike the target directly, even penetrating physical barriers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts consistent Special damage to the target. As a **Sound-based move**, it possesses the unique mechanic of **bypassing Substitute**, hitting the Pokémon behind the decoy directly.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance for additional effects).
* **Targeting:** All Opponents (hits both foes in Double Battles without affecting the ally).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 10 (Max 16).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Spread Damage Dealer.
* **Usage:** Hyper Voice is the gold standard for Special Normal-type STAB. While it lacks the sheer raw power of *Boomburst*, its wider distribution makes it a staple. In Doubles, it is a premier **Spread Move**, though it suffers from a 25% damage reduction when hitting multiple targets. It is most feared when paired with **"-ate" abilities** (Pixilate, Refrigerate, Aerilate), which convert it into a different type and grant a 20% power boost, effectively turning it into a high-accuracy, Substitute-piercing nuke.
* **Type Matchups:** As a Normal-type move, it deals neutral damage to most types but is **resisted by Rock and Steel**, and **Ghost-types are immune** (unless the user has the Scrappy ability).
* **Attributes:** Sound-based (Blocked by the *Soundproof* ability).

## Distribution & Notable Users
Hyper Voice has an exceptionally wide distribution (246 learners), making it a common choice for Special attackers lacking better STAB options.
* **Prominent Users:** 
    * **Sylveon:** Utilizes *Pixilate* to turn Hyper Voice into a devastating Fairy-type STAB.
    * **Mega Gardevoir / Mega Altaria:** Both use *Pixilate* to bypass Substitutes with Fairy-type pressure.
    * **Ursaluna-Bloodmoon:** Leverages its massive Special Attack and *Mind's Eye* ability to hit Ghost-types with Hyper Voice.
    * **Exploud:** A classic user that uses *Scrappy* to ensure no Ghost-type can switch in safely.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Pokémon like **Hydreigon**, **Dragapult**, and **Iron Valiant** as a reliable way to hit through Substitutes or provide spread pressure in VGC formats.
* **Acquisition:** Widely accessible as a **TM (TM042 in Gen 8, TM117 in Gen 9)** and was a common Move Tutor option in previous generations.
