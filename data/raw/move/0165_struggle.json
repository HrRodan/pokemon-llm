This move is used automatically when a Pok\u00e9mon cannot use any other move legally, e.g., due to having no PP remaining or being under the effect of both encore and torment at the same time.  This move\u2019s recoil is not treated as recoil for the purposes of anything that affects recoil, such as the ability rock head.  It also is not prevented by magic guard.  This move cannot be copied by mimic, mirror move, or sketch, nor selected by assist or metronome, nor forced by encore.",
