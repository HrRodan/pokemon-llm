## Identity & Mechanics
**Psycho Boost** is a Special Psychic-type move introduced in Generation III.
* **Description:** The user focuses its mental energy to the absolute limit, releasing a devastating wave of telekinetic power that warps the space around the target. This cosmic-themed attack represents the pinnacle of Psychic-type offensive capability, though the immense mental strain leaves the user’s cognitive power depleted immediately after use.
* **Effect:** Inflicts massive damage on the target. Following the attack, the user’s Special Attack stat is lowered by two stages (-2 Sp. Atk).
* **Secondary Effect:** 100% chance to lower the user's Special Attack.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 140, Accuracy 90%, PP 5.
* **Role:** High-Risk Nuke / Wallbreaker.
* **Usage:** Psycho Boost is the Psychic-type equivalent of moves like *Draco Meteor*, *Overheat*, and *Leaf Storm*. It is used to secure immediate OHKOs (One-Hit Knockouts) against neutral or frail targets. Because of the sharp Special Attack drop, it is primarily used by "Hit-and-Run" attackers or pivot-heavy teams. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fighting** and **Poison** types.
* **Attributes:** Non-contact. Special move. Synergizes with items like White Herb to negate the initial stat drop or Eject Pack to force a pivot after attacking.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (4 learners). It is famously the **signature move of Deoxys**.
* **Prominent Users:** Utilized almost exclusively by **Deoxys-Attack**, **Deoxys-Normal**, and **Deoxys-Speed**. In Deoxys-Attack's hands, this move becomes one of the most powerful unboosted attacks in the game due to its base 180 Special Attack.
* **Coverage Utility:** Historically, this move was also seen on a special event **Lugia** (from Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness), providing the defensive wall with a surprise high-damage "nuke" option to punish Poison-types like Toxapex or Fighting-types like Urshifu.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM, TR, or Move Tutor. It remains a signature move inherent to the Deoxys lineage.
