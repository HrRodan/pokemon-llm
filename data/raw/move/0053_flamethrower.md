## Identity & Mechanics
**Flamethrower** is a Special Fire-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user exhales a steady, intense stream of fire at the target. This searing blast is designed to incinerate anything in its path and is considered one of the most iconic and reliable Fire-type techniques in the Pokémon world.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage to a single target.
* **Secondary Effect:** 10% chance to Burn the target, which lowers the target's Attack stat and deals chip damage every turn.
* **Targeting:** Single Target (selected Pokémon).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 90, Accuracy 100%, PP 15 (Max 24).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Flamethrower is the "gold standard" for Special Fire-type damage. While it lacks the raw "Wallbreaking" power of **Fire Blast** (110 Power), its perfect accuracy makes it the preferred choice for tactical consistency and long-term stays on the field. It is often compared to **Lava Plume**, which has lower power but a higher Burn chance (30%). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Grass, Ice, Bug, and Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This move is a non-contact, Special attack. It can be boosted by **Sun** (Sunny Day/Drought) and is weakened by **Rain**.

It has a very wide distribution (268 learners), making it one of the most accessible coverage moves in the game.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic STAB users include **Charizard**, **Heatran**, **Chi-Yu**, and **Skeledirge**. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on non-Fire Pokémon like **Dragonite**, **Garchomp**, **Nidoking**, and **Clefable** to counter Steel-type threats that would otherwise wall their primary attacks.
* **Acquisition:** Widely available via **TM/TR** in almost every generation, including the most recent Scarlet, Violet, and Indigo Disk expansions.
