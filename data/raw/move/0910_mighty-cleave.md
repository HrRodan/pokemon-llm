## Identity & Mechanics
**Mighty Cleave** is a Physical Rock-type move introduced in Generation IX (Pokémon Scarlet and Violet).
* **Description:** The user focuses brilliant, accumulated energy into the horn or blade-like protrusion atop its head, delivering a powerful, slicing blow of light. This move is specifically designed to pierce through defensive barriers, ensuring the user can cut through the target’s guard with surgical precision.
* **Effect:** This move bypasses and breaks through protection effects, including **Protect, Detect, Spiky Shield, King's Shield, Baneful Bunker, Silk Trap, and Burning Bulwark**. Unlike Feint, it does not lift the protection for the rest of the turn; it simply ignores it for this specific attack.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Single target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 95, Accuracy 100%, PP 5 (Max 8).
* **Role:** Reliable STAB / Consistency Option.
* **Usage:** Mighty Cleave is considered one of the best Physical Rock-type moves in the series due to its perfect accuracy—a rarity for high-power Rock moves like Stone Edge (80% Acc) or Rock Slide (90% Acc). It functions as a **Wallbreaker** tool by punishing opponents who rely on "Protect" for scouting or stalling out turns (such as Poison/Leech Seed stall). It deals **Super Effective** damage to **Fire, Ice, Flying, and Bug** types.
* **Attributes:** Despite the "cleave" naming convention, this move **does not make contact**, as it utilizes "light" to strike, allowing the user to avoid negative effects from items like Rocky Helmet or abilities like Rough Skin.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a **Narrow** distribution, functioning as a **Signature Move** (1 learner).
* **Prominent Users:** Exclusively utilized by **Iron Boulder**, the Paradox relative of Terrakion. 
* **Coverage Utility:** Because it is restricted to Iron Boulder, its utility is tied to that Pokémon's niche as a fast, offensive threat. In the competitive circuit (VGC and Smogon), it allows Iron Boulder to bypass the ubiquitous "Protect" used in doubles, making it a terrifying offensive pressure tool.
* **Acquisition:** Not available via TM or TR; it is learned naturally by Iron Boulder upon leveling up.
