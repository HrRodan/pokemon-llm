## Identity & Mechanics
**Scratch** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user rakes the target with sharp claws, talons, or fingernails to inflict damage. This fundamental physical attack represents a basic display of aggression common among mammalian and reptilian Pokémon, focusing raw physical power into a swift, swiping motion.
* **Effect:** Inflicts standard physical damage to a single target with no additional properties.
* **Secondary Effect:** None (0% chance).
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single Target).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 40, Accuracy 100%, PP 35.
* **Role:** Early-game STAB / Progression Tool.
* **Usage:** Scratch serves as a foundational move for many unevolved Pokémon. In competitive play, it is virtually never used, as it is strictly outclassed by moves with higher base power or utility, such as **Slash**, **Return**, or **Facade**. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no** types, as it is a Normal-type move. It is ineffective against **Ghost** types and resisted by **Rock** and **Steel** types.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers effects like Rough Skin, Iron Barbs, or Rocky Helmet.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has a very wide distribution (121 learners), typically appearing in the initial moveset (Level 1-5) of most clawed Pokémon.
* **Prominent Users:** Iconic starters such as **Charmander**, **Litten**, **Grookey**, and **Sprigatito** utilize this as their primary physical attack in early gameplay. It is also the signature early-game move for the **Meowth** and **Sandshrew** lines.
* **Coverage Utility:** While primarily learned by Normal, Fire, and Grass types, it is found on various clawed predators like **Zangoose**, **Weavile**, and **Excadrill** during their early evolutionary stages.
* **Acquisition:** Scratch is almost exclusively learned via level-up. It is not available as a **TM, TR, or HM** in any generation, reinforcing its status as an innate, primitive biological attack.
