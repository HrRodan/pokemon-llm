## Identity & Mechanics
**Electrify** is a Status Electric-type move introduced in Generation VI (Kalos).
* **Description:** The user surges with high-voltage energy and ionizes the air around the target. If the user acts before the target, this lingering electrical field alters the fundamental properties of the target’s impending attack, forcing it to manifest as an Electric-type move regardless of its original type.
* **Effect:** Changes the type of the move the target is about to use to Electric-type. This effect only triggers if the user moves before the target in the same turn.
* **Secondary Effect:** None.
* **Targeting:** Selected Pokémon (Single).

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power — , Accuracy —%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Disruption / Defensive Utility.
* **Usage:** Electrify is a high-skill "tech" move used primarily for neutralization and redirection. It is most effective when paired with a Ground-type teammate or a Pokémon with the **Volt Absorb**, **Lightning Rod**, or **Motor Drive** abilities, effectively turning an opponent’s attack into a heal or a stat boost for the ally. It is a niche counter to **Choice-locked** attackers, as it can force a powerful move (like Close Combat or Draco Meteor) to become Electric, granting the user's team a free switch-in or immunity.
* **Type Matchups:** While a status move, it forces the opponent to deal **Electric-type** damage, which is resisted by **Electric, Grass, and Dragon** types, and completely negated by **Ground** types.
* **Attributes:** Bypasses accuracy checks; fails if the target has already moved.

## Distribution & Notable Users
It has an extremely narrow distribution (3 total learners).
* **Prominent Users:** Primarily utilized by **Heliolisk** and **Boltund**. Heliolisk is the most iconic user, benefiting from its high Speed tier to ensure it moves before the opponent to trigger the effect.
* **Coverage Utility:** This move is not typically used for coverage but rather as a defensive disruptor. Because its distribution is so limited, it is rarely seen outside of dedicated gimmick or high-synergy doubles teams involving **Dry Skin** or **Volt Absorb** users.
* **Acquisition:** Highly exclusive; it is not available via TM or TR and must be learned through level-up by its specific evolutionary lines.
