## Identity & Mechanics
**Fury Attack** is a Physical Normal-type move introduced in Generation I.
* **Description:** The user strikes the target repeatedly with a sharp beak, horn, or claws in a rapid-fire sequence of 2 to 5 jabs. This move visually represents a frantic, concentrated assault, making it a staple for avian and horned Pokémon that rely on piercing maneuvers.
* **Effect:** Inflicts regular damage multiple times in a single turn. It has a 37.5% (3/8) chance to hit 2 or 3 times, and a 12.5% (1/8) chance to hit 4 or 5 times. 
* **Secondary Effect:** None, though its multi-hit nature allows it to bypass **Focus Sashes**, **Sturdy**, **Disguise**, and **Substitutes**.
* **Targeting:** Single Target.

## Competitive Profile
* **Stats:** Power 15 (Max 75), Accuracy 85%, PP 20.
* **Role:** Early-game Multi-hit / Utility.
* **Usage:** Primarily used in early-game playthroughs. In competitive play, it is generally outclassed by more reliable Normal-type moves like **Return** or **Double-Edge**, or higher-power multi-hit moves like **Tail Slap**. Its main niche is the ability to break through protection mechanics like Mimikyu's Disguise or a Shedinja's potential Focus Sash. It pairs effectively with a **King’s Rock** to maximize flinch chances or **Loaded Dice** (Gen IX) to guarantee 4–5 hits. It deals **Super Effective** damage to **no types**, as it is a Normal-type move.
* **Attributes:** This is a **Contact** move, meaning it triggers abilities like Rough Skin or items like Rocky Helmet on every individual hit.

It has a wide distribution (60 learners), appearing frequently across various regions.
* **Prominent Users:** Commonly utilized by early-route Flying and Bug types such as **Fearow**, **Beedrill**, and **Dodrio**, as well as heavy hitters like **Heracross** and **Nidoking**.
* **Coverage Utility:** Frequently seen on Steel and Water types like **Corviknight**, **Empoleon**, and **Escavalier**, often serving as a leveling move before they access their more powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) options.
* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned through level-up; it is rarely available as a TM or TR, making its presence mostly dependent on a Pokémon's natural move pool.
