## Identity & Lore
Bulbasaur (Pokedex #001) is the dual-type Grass/Poison Seed Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinctive for the large plant bulb on its back, this quadrupedal, reptilian Pokémon is born with a strange seed planted on it, which sprouts and grows alongside the creature. It is known to nap in bright sunlight, using the rays to photosynthesize nutrients and swell the bulb on its back. While generally found in grasslands, Bulbasaur is extremely rare in the wild and is best known as one of the three Starter Pokémon offered by Professor Oak in the Kanto region. While Bulbasaur itself does not change form, its final evolution, Venusaur, possesses both a Mega Evolution and a Gigantamax form.
