## Identity & Lore
Girafarig (Pokedex #203) is the Long Neck Pokémon first introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. This dual-type Normal/Psychic creature is instantly recognizable by its yellow and black coat and its long neck. Biologically unique, Girafarig possesses a small, rudimentary brain located in its tail. While the main head sleeps, the tail remains active and vigilant, instinctively biting at anyone who approaches from behind. This tail does not require sleep and reacts primarily to scents. Originally a single-stage Pokémon, recent biological discoveries in the Paldea region revealed it is capable of further evolution. It resides primarily in **grassland** habitats.

## Evolution & Biology
Girafarig is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Farigiraf** when leveled up while knowing the move **Twin Beam**. This evolution signifies the synchronization of the head and tail brains. It belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group and hatches after approximately 5,120 steps (20 cycles).
