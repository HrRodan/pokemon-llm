## Identity & Lore
Wobbuffet (Pokédex #202) is the **Patient Pokémon**, a pure Psychic-type introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Characterized by its soft, blue, blob-like body and perpetually pained expression, Wobbuffet is a creature of endurance rather than aggression. It inhabits **caves** and other dark places to avoid light and shock. Lore dictates that Wobbuffet desperately protects its black, eye-spotted tail, leading to speculation that the tail contains its true sentience or vital organs. It is strictly docile and will never initiate an attack, only inflating its body to absorb impacts and retaliate.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 190, Attack 33, Defense 58, Sp. Atk 33, Sp. Def 58, Speed 33.
*   **Archetype:** Passive Trapper / HP Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Bug, Ghost, and Dark** types. It **resists Fighting and Psychic** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Because Wobbuffet cannot learn offensive moves, its strategy relies entirely on prediction and retaliation. Its optimal kit includes **Counter** (to return physical damage double), **Mirror Coat** (to return special damage double), **Encore** (to lock opponents into a non-damaging move), and **Destiny Bond** (to ensure a mutual knockout if it faints).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Shadow Tag:** Prevents the opposing Pokémon from fleeing or switching out. This is Wobbuffet's defining competitive trait, allowing it to trap and eliminate specific threats.
    *   **Telepathy (Hidden):** Anticipates an ally's attack and dodges it, useful primarily in Double Battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Wobbuffet is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the baby Pokémon **Wynaut** starting at **Level 15**. Uniquely, to produce a Wynaut Egg, a parent Wobbuffet must usually hold the **Lax Incense** during breeding; otherwise, the egg will hatch directly into a Wobbuffet. It belongs to the **Amorphous** Egg Group.
