## Identity & Lore
Wigglytuff (Pokedex #040) is the "Balloon Pokémon," a Normal/Fairy-type creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Residing primarily in grasslands, this Pokémon possesses incredibly soft, fine fur and a rubbery, elastic body that allows it to inflate by inhaling air. When angered, Wigglytuff can expand to an enormous size to intimidate rivals or bounce off attacks. It is famously depicted as the eccentric Guildmaster in the *Pokémon Mystery Dungeon* series. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it shares a striking resemblance to the ancient Paradox Pokémon, **Scream Tail**, found in the Paldea region.

## Evolution & Biology
Wigglytuff is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It begins as Igglybuff, which evolves into Jigglypuff when leveled up with **High Friendship**. Jigglypuff subsequently evolves into Wigglytuff only when exposed to a **Moon Stone**. It belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group and has a relatively fast hatch cycle (Cycle count: 10). In the wild, it is occasionally found holding a Moon Stone or Oran Berry.
