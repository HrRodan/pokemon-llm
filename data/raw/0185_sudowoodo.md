## Identity & Lore
Sudowoodo (Pokedex #185) is the Imitation Pokémon, first discovered in Generation II (Johto). While it mimics the appearance of a tree to camouflage itself within forest habitats, its body is composed entirely of brown rock, making it physically distinct from plant life. Because its composition is geological rather than biological, it possesses a severe aversion to water and will flee from rain to avoid erosion or damage. Sudowoodo is famous in Pokémon lore for obstructing paths, such as Route 36 in Johto, pretending to be a small tree until interacted with.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 100, Defense 115, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 65, Speed 30.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Trick Room Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Rock type, it is **weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, Water, and Grass**. It **resists Normal, Flying, Poison, and Fire** damage.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and specific Ability synergy, key moves include **Head Smash** (massive STAB damage), **Wood Hammer** (coverage against Water/Ground types), **Sucker Punch** (priority to bypass low speed), and **Earthquake**.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP.
    *   **Rock Head:** Protects the Pokémon from recoil damage. This is strategically vital as it negates the self-damage of high-power moves like Head Smash and Wood Hammer.
    *   **Rattled (Hidden):** Boosts Speed when hit by a Bug, Ghost, or Dark-type move.

## Evolution & Biology
Sudowoodo is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the baby Pokémon **Bonsly** specifically when leveled up while knowing the move **Mimic**. Without learning this move, Bonsly will not evolve regardless of its level. Sudowoodo belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles. Despite its humanoid shape and mimicry behaviors, it functions biologically as a rock entity.
