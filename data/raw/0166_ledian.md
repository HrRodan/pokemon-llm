## Identity & Lore
Ledian (Pokédex #166) is known as the Five Star Pokémon, a Bug/Flying-type introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in forests, this nocturnal creature sleeps wrapped in leaves during the day and becomes active when the stars shine. Its lore is deeply connected to the night sky; the spots on its back grow or shrink depending on the number of stars visible, and it flutters about scattering a glowing powder that is said to bring good luck. Despite its insectoid appearance, its design draws inspiration from tokusatsu heroes, emphasized by its humanoid stance and punching behaviors.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 35, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 110, Speed 85.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Special Sponge / Utility Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** Ledian suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock-type** attacks, making it extremely vulnerable to Stealth Rock. It is also weak to Flying, Fire, Electric, and Ice. However, it boasts a **Double Resistance (1/4 damage) to Fighting and Grass**, standard resistance to Bug, and an **Immunity to Ground**.
*   **Move Selection:** Because Ledian possesses very low offensive stats but high Speed and Special Defense, its optimal moveset focuses on supporting teammates rather than direct damage.
    *   **Reflect:** Halves physical damage for the team, shoring up its lower Defense.
    *   **Light Screen:** Halves special damage, making the team incredibly bulky.
    *   **U-turn:** Allows Ledian to pivot out of bad matchups while breaking Focus Sashes.
    *   **Roost:** Provides reliable HP recovery to keep Ledian on the field longer.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swarm:** Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.
    *   **Early Bird:** The Pokémon awakens from sleep twice as fast as other Pokémon.
    *   **Iron Fist (Hidden):** Boosts the power of punching moves (like *Mach Punch* or *Thunder Punch*) by 20%. While this synergizes with Ledian's move pool, it contradicts its low base Attack stat.

## Evolution & Biology
Ledian is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Ledyba** starting at **Level 18**. While Ledyba are often seen in swarms during the day, the evolution into Ledian marks a shift to a solitary, nocturnal lifestyle dependent on starlight for energy. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches relatively quickly compared to other species.
