## Identity & Lore
Pikachu (Pokedex #025) is the iconic Electric-type Mouse Pokémon originally discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its yellow fur and jagged tail, this species generally makes its habitat in forests. Its cheek sacs serve as storage pouches for electricity; when several of these Pokémon gather in one location, their combined energy output can build significantly, potentially causing localized lightning storms.

## Combat Profile
In battle, Pikachu functions primarily as a fast Glass Cannon or Sweeper, utilizing its base Speed (90) to outmaneuver opponents. While its natural bulk is low, it can hold the specific item Light Ball to double its Attack and Special Attack stats, making it a formidable mixed attacker. It is **weak to Ground-type** moves and **resists Electric, Flying, and Steel-type** attacks. It possesses the ability Static, which has a chance to paralyze attackers upon contact, or the Hidden Ability Lightning Rod, which draws in single-target Electric moves to nulify the damage and boost its own Special Attack.

## Evolution & Biology
Pikachu is the middle stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Pichu when leveled up with high friendship. Subsequently, when exposed to a Thunder Stone, it evolves into its final form, Raichu. Biologically, it falls under the Ground and Fairy Egg Groups.
