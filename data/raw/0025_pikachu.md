## Identity & Lore
Pikachu (Pokedex #025) is the Electric-type Mouse Pokémon originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). Characterized by its yellow fur and jagged, lightning-bolt tail, this quadruped typically inhabits **forest** environments. Biological lore indicates that when several of these Pokémon gather, their combined electricity can build up intense power, potentially causing lightning storms. While standard specimens appear as described, Pikachu possesses a unique **Gigantamax** potential (typically involving specific factors not listed in standard forms) and is the mascot of the franchise. It is arguably the most recognized Pokémon in existence.
