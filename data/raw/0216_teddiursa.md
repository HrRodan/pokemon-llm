## Identity & Lore
Teddiursa (Pokedex #216) is the Little Bear Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Generation II (Johto)** region. This brown, upright creature inhabits mountainous terrain where it actively seeks out honey. Uniquely, the crescent moon mark on its forehead glows when it stumbles upon honey, and it habitually licks its paws which are often soaked in the sweet substance. While Teddiursa itself does not possess alternate forms, its evolutionary line gained significant expansion in the ancient Hisui region, linking it to the formidable **Ursaluna**.

## Evolution & Biology
Teddiursa is the first stage of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Ursaring** starting at **Level 30**. In regions where specific conditions are met, Ursaring can evolve further into the ground-based **Ursaluna** when exposed to a **Peat Block** during a **Full Moon**. Teddiursa belongs to the **Ground** (Field) Egg Group and requires a Hatch Counter of 20 cycles.
