## Identity & Lore
Gyarados (Pokedex #130) is the Atrocious Pokémon, a dual-type Water/Flying serpent introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its violent temperament, this massive blue Pokémon dwells at the water's edge and is capable of leveling entire cities when it goes on a rampage. Its lore stands as a stark contrast to its pre-evolution; it is widely believed to be the embodiment of the myth where a carp leaps over a dragon gate to become a dragon. While standard Gyarados are blue, a genetic mutation can cause them to appear red, a phenomenon notably observed at the Lake of Rage. Through the power of a Gyaradosite, it is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** to become Mega Gyarados, gaining the Dark type and significantly enhanced combat capabilities.

*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Intimidate:** Lowers the opposing Pokémon's Attack stat by one stage upon entering battle, providing excellent defensive utility.
    *   **Moxie (Hidden Ability):** Boosts the user's Attack stat by one stage after knocking out any Pokémon, facilitating a "snowball" sweep effect.

## Evolution & Biology
Gyarados is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from the famously weak **Magikarp** starting at **Level 20**. This evolution represents a massive power spike, changing its demeanor from docile to aggressive. It belongs to the **Water 2** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, and despite its draconic appearance, it does not gain the Dragon typing until it Mega Evolves.
