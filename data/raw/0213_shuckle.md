## Identity & Lore
Shuckle (Pokedex #213) is the Mold Pokémon, a unique Bug/Rock-type introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Residing primarily in **mountain** habitats and under rocks, this yellow, armor-shelled creature is famous for its extreme biological specialization. Shuckle stores **Berries** inside its vase-like shell; the berries eventually decompose and ferment into a gooey liquid known as **Berry Juice** due to the Pokémon's digestive fluids. While unassuming in appearance, Shuckle holds a legendary status in Pokémon lore for possessing the highest base Defense and Special Defense stats of any Pokémon (prior to the introduction of Eternamax Eternatus), making it an impenetrable wall in the right circumstances.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 20, Attack 10, Defense 230, Sp. Atk 10, Sp. Def 230, Speed 5.
*   **Archetype:** Dedicated Hazard Setter / Stall Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** Shuckle possesses a unique defensive typing. It is **weak to Rock, Steel, and Water**. Despite the vulnerabilities of its individual types, they cover each other well, leaving it with **resistances to Normal and Poison**.
*   **Move Selection:** Because its offensive stats are negligible, Shuckle relies on utility and hazards. Its optimal moveset includes **Sticky Web** (lowering opponent speed upon entry), **Stealth Rock** (damaging foes upon entry), **Encore** (locking foes into non-damaging moves), and **Toxic** (badly poisoning the target).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit if it is at full HP. This is Shuckle's most viable competitive ability, guaranteeing it can set up at least one hazard layer.
    *   **Gluttony:** Encourages the Pokémon to use a held Berry earlier than usual.
    *   **Contrary (Hidden):** Reverses stat changes (e.g., lowering stats boosts them instead). This enables the risky "Shell Smash" strategy.

## Evolution & Biology
Shuckle is a standalone Pokémon and is not part of an evolutionary chain; it does not evolve from or into any other species. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group. In the wild, Shuckle is occasionally found holding **Berry Juice**, reflecting its lore as a fermentation vessel. While it has incredibly low Speed and offensive power naturally, it can utilize the move **Power Trick** to swap its massive Defense with its pitiful Attack, theoretically allowing it to deal the highest damage possible in a single hit under specific conditions.
