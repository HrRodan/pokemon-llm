## Identity & Lore
Ariados (Pokedex #168) is the Long Leg Pokémon, a dual-type Bug/Poison arachnid introduced in Generation II (Johto). Residing primarily in **forests**, this red-colored predator is known for its ability to spin strong, sticky silk from both its rear spinnerets and its mouth, making it difficult for opponents to distinguish which end is the head. Unlike many spiders that wait in a single web, Ariados wanders nocturnally in search of prey, attaching silk to its victims to track them and feast later. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is a staple of the early-game insect ecosystem in the Johto region.

## Evolution & Biology
Ariados is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Spinarak** starting at **Level 22**. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and possesses a relatively fast hatch cycle. Biologically, its feet are tipped with tiny hooked claws that allow it to scuttle across ceilings and vertical surfaces effortlessly.
