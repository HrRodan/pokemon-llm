## Identity & Lore
Jigglypuff (Pokedex #039) is the Balloon Pokémon, a pink, spherical creature originating from Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its large, round eyes, this Fairy/Normal-type inhabits grassland areas. When its huge eyes light up, it inflates its body and sings a mysteriously soothing melody that invariably lulls its enemies to sleep.

## Combat Profile
In battle, Jigglypuff functions primarily as a **Support** unit or **HP Sponge** relying on its massive base HP of 115, though it is hindered by very poor defensive and speed stats. It is **weak to Poison and Steel** techniques, but offers valuable **resistances to Bug and Dark** types, along with complete **immunity to Ghost and Dragon** moves. It may possess the ability **Cute Charm**, which can infatuate opponents on contact, or **Competitive**, which sharply raises its Special Attack if its stats are lowered. Its Hidden Ability, **Friend Guard**, reduces damage taken by allies, making it useful in team formats.

## Evolution & Biology
Jigglypuff is the middle member of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from Igglybuff when leveled up with **high friendship** and evolves into Wigglytuff when exposed to a **Moon Stone**. It belongs to the **Fairy** Egg Group. Wild specimens are occasionally found holding an Oran Berry or a Moon Stone.
