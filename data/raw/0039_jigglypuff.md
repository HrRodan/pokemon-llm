## Identity & Lore
Jigglypuff (Pokedex #039) is the Balloon Pokémon, a recognizable pink, spherical creature famous for its large, captivating eyes and rubbery skin. Originating from Generation I (Kanto), this Fairy/Normal-type is found in grasslands and meadow habitats. Jigglypuff is renowned for its lung capacity; it can inflate its body to enormous sizes and sing a soothing melody with a specific wavelength that creates a drowsy effect, forcing opponents into a deep slumber. In competitive lore and historical contexts, it is widely known for its appearance in the *Super Smash Bros.* series and the anime, where it notably scribbles on the faces of those who fall asleep during its performance. In the Paldea region (Generation IX), an ancient Paradox form known as **Scream Tail** bears a striking resemblance to Jigglypuff, possessing heightened aggression and primal traits.
