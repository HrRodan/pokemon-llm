## Identity & Lore
Cyndaquil (Pokedex #155) is the **Fire Mouse Pokémon**, best known as the Fire-type starter introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Small and quadrupedal, this Pokémon is characterized by its yellow and cream coloration and its preference for **grassland** habitats. Cyndaquil possesses a notably **timid nature**; it often curls into a ball to protect its soft body when threatened. However, despite its shy demeanor, it is capable of significant offensive power; when startled or preparing for battle, the four red spots on its back erupt into vigorous flames. While Cyndaquil does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, its evolutionary line gained significant lore expansion in *Pokémon Legends: Arceus*, where its final evolution can take on a regional **Hisuian Form**.

## Evolution & Biology
Cyndaquil is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Quilava** when leveled up to **Level 14**. Quilava then evolves into the standard **Typhlosion** starting at **Level 36**. However, in the ancient Hisui region, Quilava evolves into the Fire/Ghost-type **Hisuian Typhlosion**. Cyndaquil belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group and has a medium-slow growth rate.
