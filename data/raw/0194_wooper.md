## Identity & Lore
Wooper (Pokedex #194) is the Water Fish Pokémon, first discovered in Generation II (Johto). Recognized by its armless blue body and purple branching gills, this amphibious creature inhabits the **waters-edge** and cold ponds. While it prefers the water, the **Water/Ground**-type Wooper will venture onto land in search of food when temperatures drop. It is characterized by a relaxed demeanor and a constant, vacuous smile. While this profile details the standard Johto form, a Poison/Ground regional variant known as **Paldean Wooper** exists in the Paldea region.

## Evolution & Biology
Wooper is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. The standard Johto form evolves into **Quagsire** starting at **Level 20**. However, the Paldean form of Wooper evolves into **Clodsire** at the same level. Wooper belongs to the **Water 1** and **Ground** Egg Groups, and it requires a medium growth rate to reach maturity.
