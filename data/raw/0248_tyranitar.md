## Identity & Lore
Tyranitar (Pokedex #248) is the Armor Pokémon, a pseudo-legendary beast originating from **Generation II (Johto)**. Renowned for its immense power and insolence, this green, upright reptilian wanders the mountains seeking worthy opponents. Its armored body is virtually indestructible, allowing it to ignore attacks while it destroys entire landscapes to build its nest, often forcing cartographers to redraw maps. Beyond its standard form, it possesses a **Mega Evolution** (Mega Tyranitar) and bears a striking resemblance to the futuristic Paradox Pokémon, **Iron Thorns**.

*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Sweeper / Weather Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Rock/Dark type, it suffers a critical **Double Weakness (4x) to Fighting**. It is also weak to Ground, Bug, Steel, Water, Grass, and Fairy types. However, it is **immune to Psychic** attacks and resists Dark, Ghost, Flying, Poison, Fire, and Normal types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Attack stat, key moves include **Stone Edge** and **Crunch** for powerful STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus), **Earthquake** for coverage against Steel and Rock types, and **Dragon Dance** to simultaneously boost its Attack and Speed. It also excels at setting entry hazards like **Stealth Rock**.

    *   **Sand Stream:** Summons a sandstorm upon entering battle. Uniquely, this weather condition boosts the Special Defense of Rock-types (including Tyranitar) by 50%.
    *   **Unnerve:** Unnerves opposing Pokémon and makes them unable to eat Berries.

## Evolution & Biology
Tyranitar is the final form of a 3-stage evolutionary line within the **Monster** Egg Group. It begins life as **Larvitar**, which evolves into **Pupitar** upon reaching **Level 30**. Finally, Pupitar evolves into Tyranitar when it reaches **Level 55**. This evolutionary chain is characterized by a "Slow" growth rate, requiring significant experience points to reach its full potential.
