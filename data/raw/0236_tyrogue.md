## Identity & Lore
Tyrogue (Pokedex #236) is the Scuffle Pokémon, a humanoid Baby Pokémon originally discovered in the Johto region (Generation II). Defined by its limitless stamina, Tyrogue is always bursting with energy and possesses a competitive spirit that drives it to challenge larger opponents to strengthen itself, even if it suffers defeat. It has a purple, athletic appearance resembling a young martial artist wrapped in bandages. Tyrogue is unique in the biological classification of Pokémon as the pre-evolutionary "blank slate" for three distinct martial arts masters: Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, and Hitmontop.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 35, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 35, Sp. Def 35, Speed 35.
*   **Archetype:** Balanced Physical Trainee / Little Cup Utility.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fighting-type, it is **weak to Flying, Psychic, and Fairy** attacks. It **resists Rock, Bug, and Dark** types.
*   **Move Selection:** While its stats are perfectly balanced, its move pool favors physical offense and utility. Key moves include **High Jump Kick** for raw damage, **Mach Punch** for priority, **Fake Out** for immediate flinching pressure, and **Rapid Spin** for hazard removal.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Guts:** Boosts the Attack stat by 50% if the Pokémon has a status condition (Burn, Paralyze, Poison).
    *   **Steadfast:** Raises Speed by one stage each time the Pokémon flinches.
    *   **Vital Spirit (Hidden):** Makes the Pokémon immune to Sleep status conditions.

## Evolution & Biology
Tyrogue is part of a complex 2-stage evolutionary line where its final form is determined by its physical growth at the moment of evolution. It evolves at **Level 20**, and the resulting Pokémon depends on the relationship between its Attack and Defense stats:
*   It evolves into **Hitmonlee** if its Attack is **higher** than its Defense.
*   It evolves into **Hitmonchan** if its Attack is **lower** than its Defense.
*   It evolves into **Hitmontop** if its Attack is **equal** to its Defense.

As a Baby Pokémon, Tyrogue belongs to the **No-Eggs** (Undiscovered) egg group and cannot breed. To obtain a Tyrogue egg, one must breed a Hitmonlee, Hitmonchan, or Hitmontop with a Ditto.
