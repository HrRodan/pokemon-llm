## Identity & Lore
Octillery (Pokédex #224) is the Jet Pokémon, a pure Water-type entity introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its bright red coloration and cephalopod physiology, Octillery inhabits the sea, where it instinctively seeks out rocky crags or pot-like vessels to nest in. It is famous for its bizarre evolutionary logic, transforming from a fish resembling a handgun into an octopus resembling a tank or turret. In the wild, Octillery utilizes the suction cups on its tentacles to firmly trap prey before delivering a crushing blow with its rock-hard head. While it possesses no known Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, its distinct biology allows it to project ink and water with ballistic force.

## Evolution & Biology
Octillery is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Remoraid** when leveled up to **Level 25**. This transformation is notable for the drastic morphological shift from a fish (Remoraid) to an octopus (Octillery), mimicking the concept of a firearm upgrading to heavy artillery. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 2** Egg Groups and has a Hatch Counter of 20.
