## Identity & Lore
Flaaffy (Pokedex #180) is the Wool Pokémon, originally discovered in the **Generation II (Johto)** region. This pink, bipedal Pokémon inhabits **grasslands** and is easily distinguished by the thick coat of white wool covering its head and upper body. Its biology is centered around electricity storage; according to ecological research, Flaaffy stores so much electricity that it develops bald patches where its downy wool cannot grow. Its rubbery skin acts as insulation, preventing it from electrocuting itself. While Flaaffy does not possess a temporary form change itself, it is the evolutionary precursor to Ampharos, which is capable of achieving **Mega Evolution** in later generations.

## Evolution & Biology
Flaaffy is the middle stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Mareep** starting at **Level 15** and evolves into **Ampharos** starting at **Level 30**. Unlike its pre-evolution which is fully covered in wool, Flaaffy begins to shed its coat to manage its electrical output. It belongs to the **Monster** and **Ground** Egg Groups, with a hatch counter of 20 cycles.
