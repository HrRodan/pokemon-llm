## Identity & Lore
Sandshrew (Pokedex #027) is the Ground-type Mouse Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its yellow, brick-patterned hide, Sandshrew possesses a dry, tough skin that minimizes water loss, allowing it to survive in arid locations and rough terrain. It is a burrowing creature that digs deep underground to avoid the heat of the day, only emerging to hunt for food. When threatened, it curls into a tight ball, exposing only its hard back to predators while protecting its soft, white underbelly. While this profile details the standard Ground-type form, Sandshrew possesses a notable regional variant found in the Alola region, which adapts to snowy mountains as an Ice/Steel type.

## Evolution & Biology
Sandshrew is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Sandslash** starting at **Level 22**. While the standard form evolves via leveling up, its Alolan variant requires an Ice Stone to evolve. Sandshrew belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 20 cycles. In the wild, it is known to carry items such as the Quick Claw or Grip Claw.
