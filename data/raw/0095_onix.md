## Identity & Lore
Onix (Pokedex #095) is the massive **Rock Snake Pokémon**, a gargantuan serpentine creature originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Composed of a chain of gray, boulder-like segments that diminish in size towards its tail, Onix is capable of rotating its body parts 360 degrees. This Pokémon creates thunderous tremors as it tunnels underground at speeds of 50 mph, often searching for food while absorbing hard objects that contribute to its rocky composition. According to biological research, Onix possesses a magnet in its brain that functions as an internal compass, preventing it from getting lost while burrowing. As an Onix ages, the stone portions of its body smooth out and harden, eventually becoming black and diamond-like in durability. It is primarily found in **cave** environments where light is scarce.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 45, Defense 160, Sp. Atk 30, Sp. Def 45, Speed 70.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Wall / Utility Lead.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual **Rock/Ground** type, Onix possesses extreme defensive polarization. It suffers from **Double Weaknesses (4x) to Grass and Water** moves. It is also weak to Fighting, Ground, Steel, and Ice. However, it boasts an **Immunity to Electric** attacks and resists Normal, Flying, Rock, Fire, and Poison types.
*   **Move Selection:** Despite a low Attack stat, Onix utilizes its massive Defense for offense via specific mechanics. Its optimal kit includes:
    *   **Body Press:** The most critical move in its arsenal, calculating damage based on Onix's massive 160 Defense rather than its poor Attack.
    *   **Stealth Rock:** Capitalizes on its physical bulk and Speed to set up entry hazards.
    *   **Earthquake:** A reliable STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) move for consistent physical damage.
    *   **Stone Edge:** A high-power Rock-type STAB move to handle Flying and Bug types.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage from moves like Double-Edge, though Onix's low attack makes this situational.
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing at least one turn to set up hazards like Stealth Rock.
    *   **Weak Armor (Hidden):** When hit by a physical move, Defense lowers by one stage but Speed raises by two stages, allowing for a pivot into a faster, albeit more fragile, role.

## Evolution & Biology
Onix is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into the Steel/Ground-type **Steelix** when it is **traded while holding a Metal Coat**. While Onix does not possess a Mega Evolution itself, its evolved form, Steelix, is capable of Mega Evolution. Onix belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and takes approximately 25 egg cycles to hatch. Its body structure and evolution process suggest a biology based on extreme pressure and mineral compression.
