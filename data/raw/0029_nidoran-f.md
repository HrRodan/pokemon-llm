## Identity & Lore
Nidoran♀ (Pokedex #029) is the Poison Pin Pokémon, first discovered in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its light blue coloration and smaller horns compared to its male counterpart, this Pokémon inhabits grasslands where it uses its small size to hide. Despite its diminutive stature, Nidoran♀ is dangerous; it is covered in small, venomous barbs that secrete powerful toxins to deter predators. While docile by nature, it will unleash poison from its spikes if threatened. As the female variant of the species, it represents one of the first instances of sexual dimorphism recorded in Pokémon research.

## Evolution & Biology
Nidoran♀ is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Nidorina** starting at **Level 16**, gaining significant bulk. Nidorina can subsequently evolve into the powerful **Nidoqueen** when exposed to a **Moon Stone**. Uniquely, Nidoran♀ is the only member of its evolutionary line capable of breeding; once it evolves into Nidorina or Nidoqueen, it falls into the Undiscovered Egg Group, though Nidoran♀ itself belongs to the **Monster** and **Ground** Egg Groups.
