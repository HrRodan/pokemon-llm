## Identity & Lore
Chikorita (Pokedex #152) is the **Leaf Pokémon**, a Grass-type starter introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Small, pale green, and docile, this quadruped is distinguished by the large leaf growing from the top of its head. According to ecological research, Chikorita loves to bask in sunlight and uses the leaf on its head to seek out warm places. When threatened, it waves this leaf to generate a sweet, calming aroma that wafts through the air, pacifying enemies and dampening their will to fight. It primarily inhabits **grasslands** and is one of the three starter Pokémon available to trainers in the Johto region, alongside Cyndaquil and Totodile.
