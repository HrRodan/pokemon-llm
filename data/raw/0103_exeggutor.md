## Identity & Lore
Exeggutor (Pokedex #103) is the Grass/Psychic-type Coconut Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Resembling a walking palm tree, this Pokémon is primarily found in forest habitats and is known as "The Walking Jungle." Its biology is unique in that each of its multiple heads thinks independently, yet they share a harmonious telepathy that prevents internal conflict. According to folklore, on rare occasions, one of its heads may drop off to become a new Exeggcute. While the standard form is stout with a psychic affinity, Exeggutor possesses a regional variant, the **Alolan Exeggutor**, which grows significantly taller due to abundant sunlight and gains the Dragon typing.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 95, Attack 95, Defense 85, Sp. Atk 125, Sp. Def 75, Speed 55.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Attacker / Sun Sweeper.
*   **Type Matchups:** Exeggutor suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Bug-type** moves. It is also weak to Flying, Poison, Fire, Ice, Ghost, and Dark types. However, it boasts resistances to Fighting, Ground, Water, Grass, Electric, and Psychic attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 125 Special Attack, Exeggutor excels with moves like **Solar Beam** (best used in sunlight), **Psychic** (for consistent STAB damage), and **Sludge Bomb** (for coverage against Grass and Fairy types). Because of its low Speed stat, it is also a premier user of **Trick Room**, turning its sluggishness into an advantage by moving first.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Chlorophyll:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during strong sunlight, allowing it to function as a fast sweeper despite its low base speed.
    *   **Harvest (Hidden):** May restore a consumed Berry at the end of a turn, providing exceptional sustainability when paired with healing items like Sitrus Berries.

## Evolution & Biology
Exeggutor is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Exeggcute** when exposed to a **Leaf Stone**. Unlike many Pokémon that evolve via leveling, this transformation is instantaneous upon contact with the evolutionary stone. It belongs to the **Plant** Egg Group and has a relatively slow growth rate.
