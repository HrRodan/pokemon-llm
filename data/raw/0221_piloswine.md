## Identity & Lore
Piloswine (Pokedex #221) is the Swine Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Covered in a shaggy coat of thick, brown hair, this Ice/Ground type is adapted to harsh, freezing cave environments. Because its long fur completely obscures its vision, Piloswine compensates with sensitive hearing and smell, often charging repeatedly and recklessly at targets it detects. While it is not the final stage of its evolutionary line, Piloswine is historically significant in competitive formats as a formidable tank when equipped with the **Eviolite** item, which boosts its already substantial defenses.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 100, Attack 100, Defense 80, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 60, Speed 50.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker / Hazard Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** Without its Hidden Ability, Piloswine is **weak to Fighting, Rock, Steel, Fire, Water, and Grass**, while possessing an **immunity to Electric** and resistance to Poison.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack and bulk, key moves include **Earthquake** (consistent Ground STAB), **Icicle Crash** (high-power Ice STAB), **Ice Shard** (priority to bypass low speed), and **Stealth Rock** (hazard utility).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Oblivious:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming infatuated or falling for taunts. This is crucial for ensuring it can set up hazards like Stealth Rock without being stopped by the move Taunt.
    *   **Snow Cloak:** Boosts evasion in snow.
    *   **Thick Fat (Hidden Ability):** Halves the damage taken from Fire and Ice-type moves. This is tactically vital as it neutralizes Piloswine's natural weakness to Fire and grants it an effective resistance to Ice.

## Evolution & Biology
Piloswine is the second stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Swinub** starting at **Level 33**. It evolves into the formidable **Mamoswine** when leveled up while knowing the move **Ancient Power**. Piloswine belongs to the **Ground** Egg Group.
