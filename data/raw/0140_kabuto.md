## Identity & Lore
Kabuto (Pokedex #140) is the Shellfish Pokémon, an ancient species resurrected from a **Dome Fossil** originally found on the ocean floor eons ago. First discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**, this small, brown Pokémon is characterized by its hard, protective shell which covers its black body. Biologically, Kabuto is known to conceal itself on the sea floor, using the eyes on its back to monitor its surroundings while remaining hidden from predators. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is historically significant as one of the original fossil Pokémon alongside Omanyte.
