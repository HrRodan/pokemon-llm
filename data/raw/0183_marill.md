## Identity & Lore
Marill (Pokedex #183) is the Aqua Mouse Pokémon, a spherical, blue amphibious creature native to the Johto region (Generation II). It possesses water-repellent fur and a distinctive, bubble-like tail filled with an oil that is lighter than water. This tail functions as a buoy, allowing Marill to float effortlessly at the water's edge without drowning, even in strong currents. While initially categorized solely as a Water-type, modern classification identifies it as a dual-type Water/Fairy Pokémon.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 70, Attack 20, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 20, Sp. Def 50, Speed 40.
*   **Archetype:** Bulky Physical Attacker (Ability Dependent).
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Water/Fairy type, it is **weak to Electric, Grass, and Poison**. It possesses a distinct advantage against Dragon-types (Immunity) and **resists Fire, Water, Ice, Fighting, Bug, and Dark** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** While its base offensive stats appear equal and low, Marill is almost exclusively utilized as a physical attacker due to its access to the Huge Power ability. Key moves include **Play Rough** (Fairy STAB), **Liquidation** (Water STAB), **Aqua Jet** (Priority to compensate for low speed), and **Belly Drum** (maximizes Attack at the cost of HP).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Huge Power:** Doubles the Pokémon's Attack stat. This is the defining ability that makes Marill viable in combat.
    *   **Thick Fat:** Halves the damage taken from Fire- and Ice-type moves, granting pseudo-resistances.
    *   **Sap Sipper (Hidden):** Grants immunity to Grass-type moves (a standard weakness) and boosts Attack when hit by one.
