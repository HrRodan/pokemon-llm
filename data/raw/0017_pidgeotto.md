## Identity & Lore
Pidgeotto (Pokedex #017) is the Bird Pokémon, a widely recognized avian creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Characterized by its brown plumage, pinkish-red crest, and powerful wings, this Pokémon makes its home primarily in forest habitats. It is defined by its extreme territorial behavior; the Pokédex notes that it is very protective of its sprawling territory and will fiercely peck at any intruder who dares to enter. While Pidgeotto is the middle stage of its evolutionary line, its final form possesses the potential for Mega Evolution, adding significant competitive weight to its lineage.
