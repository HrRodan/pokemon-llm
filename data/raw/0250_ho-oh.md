## Identity & Lore
Ho-Oh (Pokedex #250) is the Legendary Rainbow Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). Resembling a magnificent phoenix, its plumage is predominantly red, but legends claim its wings glow with all seven colors of the rainbow, leaving a shimmering trail behind it as it flies continuously through the world's skies. Ho-Oh is deeply entrenched in the mythology of Ecruteak City, residing atop the Bell Tower (formerly Tin Tower). It is the trio master of the Legendary Beasts—Raikou, Entei, and Suicune—whom it is said to have resurrected from the ashes of the Burned Tower. Lore suggests that Ho-Oh reveals itself only to a Trainer with a pure heart and grants eternal happiness to those lucky enough to witness it.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 106, Attack 130, Defense 90, Sp. Atk 110, Sp. Def 154, Speed 90.
*   **Archetype:** Specially Defensive Physical Attacker / Bulky Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a Fire/Flying type, it suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock** (making it vulnerable to Stealth Rock) and standard weaknesses to **Water and Electric**. It possesses an immunity to **Ground** and resistances to Fire, Grass, Fighting, Bug, Steel, and Fairy types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive Attack and Special Defense, key moves include its signature move **Sacred Fire** (which has a high chance to burn targets), **Brave Bird** for high-power Flying STAB, **Earthquake** to cover its Rock and Electric weaknesses, and **Recover** (or Roost) to maintain longevity.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Pressure:** Forces the opposing Pokémon to use 2 PP for every move, useful for stalling out low-PP moves.
    *   **Regenerator (Hidden):** Restores 33% of the Pokémon's maximum HP when switching out. This makes Ho-Oh a premier competitive pivot, allowing it to heal off damage repeatedly throughout a match.

## Evolution & Biology
Ho-Oh is a standalone Legendary Pokémon and does not evolve into or from any other species. As a Legendary entity, it belongs to the **No Eggs** (Undiscovered) Egg Group and cannot breed. In the wild, Ho-Oh is the only known source of the **Sacred Ash**, a rare held item capable of fully reviving all fainted Pokémon in a trainer's party.
