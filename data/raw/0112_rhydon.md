## Identity & Lore
Rhydon (Pokedex #112) is the Drill Pokémon, a massive, bipedal gray creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Famous for being the first Pokémon ever designed and programmed into the original games, Rhydon possesses a rocky, armor-like hide so thick that it is capable of living in molten lava reaching 3,600 degrees without feeling pain. Found primarily in rough terrain and caves, its horn is strong enough to shatter diamonds and bore through solid rock. While it does not have a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Rhydon is a prominent user of the **Eviolite** item in competitive play, often making it physically bulkier than its final evolution.
