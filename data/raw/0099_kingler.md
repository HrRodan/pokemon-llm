## Identity & Lore
Kingler (Pokedex #099) is the Pincer Pokémon, an iconic Water-type native to the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Residing primarily at the **waters-edge**, this crustacean is defined by its massive morphological asymmetry; its left pincer grows significantly larger than the right. According to researchers, this oversized claw possesses **10,000 horsepower** of crushing force, though its immense weight can make the Pokémon unwieldy and prone to balance issues. While the standard form is red and armored, Kingler is capable of achieving a **Gigantamax** form (observed in the Galar region), where its bubbles expand into a massive beard of foam and its pincer becomes even more destructive.

## Combat Profile

*   **Archetype:** Physical Wallbreaker / Physical Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks.
*   **Move Selection:** Utilizing its colossal Attack stat, Kingler excels with physical offensive moves such as **Crabhammer** (its high-crit signature move) or **Liquidation**. For coverage against electric types, it utilizes **High Horsepower**, while **Swords Dance** allows it to boost its offensive pressure to lethal levels. **Knock Off** provides utility by removing enemy items.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Hyper Cutter:** Prevents the Pokémon's Attack stat from being lowered by Intimidate or other moves.
    *   **Shell Armor:** A defensive ability that protects the Pokémon from receiving Critical Hits.
    *   **Sheer Force (Hidden):** A highly competitive ability that boosts the power of moves with secondary effects by 30%, but removes those effects (synergizes well with Liquidation and a Life Orb item).

## Evolution & Biology
Kingler is the final stage of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Krabby** starting at **Level 28**. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group. Kingler communicates by waving its massive claw, although lifting it is physically taxing. If the claw is damaged or lost in battle, it has regenerative properties allowing it to grow back over time.
