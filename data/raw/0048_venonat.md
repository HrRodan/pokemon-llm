## Identity & Lore
Venonat (Pokédex #048) is the Insect Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This nocturnal creature is characterized by its spherical body covered in stiff, purple fur and its prominent, multifaceted red eyes. Biologically adapted for life in the shadows of tall trees and deep forests, Venonat uses its large eyes as radar to navigate darkness and track small insect prey. While it possesses no known Mega Evolution, Gigantamax, or Paradox forms, it is recognized for its keen senses; its eyes are capable of shooting powerful beams, and it is instinctively attracted to bright lights at night, often swarming around streetlamps.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 60, Attack 55, Defense 50, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 55, Speed 45.
*   **Archetype:** LC (Little Cup) Disruptor / Utility Support.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a **Bug/Poison** type, Venonat is **weak to Fire, Flying, Rock, and Psychic**. It possesses significant defensive utility, resisting **Poison, Bug, and Fairy** moves, while boasting a **Double Resistance (0.25x) to Grass and Fighting** types.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its higher Attack stat and utility capabilities, an optimal moveset includes **Sleep Powder** (to incapacitate foes), **Lunge** (STAB damage that lowers opponent's Attack), **Leech Life** (for physical sustain), and **Zen Headbutt** (for coverage against Poison or Fighting types).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Compound Eyes:** Increases the accuracy of moves by 30%. This is its most viable ability, making moves like Sleep Powder and Stun Spore highly reliable.
    *   **Tinted Lens:** Doubles the power of "not very effective" moves, preventing Venonat from being walled by resistant types.
    *   **Run Away (Hidden):** Enables a sure getaway from wild battles, though it offers no competitive combat value.

## Evolution & Biology
Venonat is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Venomoth** starting at **Level 31**. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and takes approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch. As it matures, the poison contained within its body becomes more potent, eventually leading to the development of toxic scales upon evolution. Its stiff fur functions as a sensory array, allowing it to detect the movements of prey even in total darkness.
