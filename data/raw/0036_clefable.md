## Identity & Lore
Clefable (Pokedex #036) is the timid Fairy Pokémon, renowned for its acute hearing and deep mystical connection to the cosmos. Residing in quiet, mountainous environments like Mt. Moon in the **Generation I (Kanto)** region, this pink, upright creature is notoriously elusive, often fleeing at the slightest sound of human approach. Folklore and scientific research within the Pokémon world suggest Clefable and its evolutionary line may have extraterrestrial origins, frequently observing them gathering to dance during full moon nights. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is historically significant for being reclassified from a Normal-type to a pure Fairy-type in Generation VI.
