## Identity & Lore
Scyther (Pokedex #123) is the Mantis Pokémon, a swift and lethal predator indigenous to the **Generation I (Kanto)** region. Residing primarily in grasslands and jungles, this green, bipedal insectoid is defined by the razor-sharp scythes on its forearms, which can slice through thick logs and prey alike. According to research, Scyther possesses ninja-like agility; it moves so fast that it creates the illusion of being in multiple places at once. Unlike most evolutionary lines, Scyther retains the same Base Stat Total (500) as its evolution, Scizor, making it a formidable combatant in its own right, often utilizing the **Eviolite** item to enhance its bulk. It has a divergent evolutionary line that includes the Hisuian evolution, **Kleavor**.

## Combat Profile

*   **Archetype:** Fast Physical Sweeper / Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a **Bug/Flying** type, it suffers a **Double Weakness (4x) to Rock** maneuvers (such as Stealth Rock). It is also weak to Fire, Electric, Ice, and Flying moves. However, it is immune to Ground attacks and possesses a **Double Resistance (4x) to Grass and Fighting** types, as well as a standard resistance to Bug.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its high Attack (110) and Speed, Scyther utilizes **Swords Dance** for setup, **Dual Wingbeat** or **Aerial Ace** for consistent STAB (synergizing with Technician), **U-turn** for pivoting momentum, and **Close Combat** or **Brick Break** for coverage against Rock and Steel types.

    *   **Swarm:** Powers up Bug-type moves when the Pokémon's HP is low.

## Evolution & Biology
Scyther is the base stage of a divergent evolutionary line found in the **Bug** Egg Group.
1.  **Scizor:** Scyther evolves into Scizor when **traded while holding a Metal Coat**.
2.  **Kleavor:** In the Hisui region (Legends: Arceus), Scyther evolves into Kleavor when exposed to a **Black Augurite**.
