## Identity & Lore
Umbreon (Pokédex #197) is the Moonlight Pokémon, a dark-furred quadruped introduced in Generation II (Johto). Evolved from Eevee, this Pokémon is adapted to stealth and darkness; its black fur allows it to blend perfectly into the night, while the rings on its body glow yellow when it leaps to attack or is exposed to the moon's aura. According to biological studies, when agitated, Umbreon protects itself by spraying poisonous sweat from its pores. It is one of the distinct "Eeveelutions," representing the Dark elemental type.
