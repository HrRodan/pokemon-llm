## Identity & Lore
Horsea (Pokedex #116) is the Dragon Pokémon, a diminutive aquatic creature first discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). Despite its genus name, this blue, seahorse-like entity is strictly a Water-type in its initial stage, though it carries the genetic potential to become a true dragon. Known for the complex spiral pattern on its back, Horsea inhabits safe currents and coral reefs in the sea. It utilizes a biological defense mechanism where it shoots precision blasts of ink to down flying insects for food or to create smokescreens when threatened. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is the base form of the formidable Kingdra, a staple in competitive rain teams.

## Evolution & Biology
Horsea is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Seadra** starting at **Level 32**. To reach its final form, **Kingdra**, Seadra must be **traded while holding a Dragon Scale**. Horsea belongs to the **Water 1** and **Dragon** Egg Groups. Wild Horsea are occasionally found carrying a Dragon Scale, foreshadowing their evolutionary requirement.
