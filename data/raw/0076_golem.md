## Identity & Lore
Golem (Pokedex #076) is the Megaton Pokémon, a massive Rock/Ground-type entity originally discovered in **Generation I (Kanto)**. Residing primarily in rugged **mountain** terrains, this Pokémon is characterized by its spherical, boulder-like body and a carapace so incredibly durable that it can withstand direct dynamite blasts without sustaining damage. Golem is known to shed its rocky skin once a year, with the discarded shell crumbling into soil that enriches the surrounding ecosystem. While this profile details the standard Kantonian form, Golem also possesses a Rock/Electric regional variant found in the Alola region.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 120, Defense 130, Sp. Atk 55, Sp. Def 65, Speed 45.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Wallbreaker.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a dual Rock/Ground type, Golem possesses extreme defensive vulnerabilities. It suffers from a **Double Weakness (4x) to Water and Grass** types, as well as standard weaknesses to Fighting, Ground, Steel, and Ice. However, it completely **resists (Immune)** Electric-type attacks and resists Normal, Fire, Poison, Flying, and Rock moves.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its massive 120 Attack stat and high durability, Golem functions best with high-power physical STAB (Same Type Attack Bonus) moves and utility options. Key moves include **Earthquake**, **Stone Edge**, **Double-Edge** (best used with Rock Head), and **Stealth Rock** or **Explosion** for a final burst of damage.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Rock Head:** Prevents recoil damage. This makes moves like Double-Edge distinctively viable without wearing down Golem's HP.
    *   **Sturdy:** Prevents the Pokémon from being knocked out in one hit when at full HP, guaranteeing at least one turn to attack or set up hazards.
    *   **Sand Veil (Hidden):** Increases evasion during a sandstorm.

## Evolution & Biology
Golem is the final stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Graveler** specifically when **traded** between trainers. Graveler evolves from the base form, **Geodude**, starting at **Level 25**. Biologically, Golem belongs to the **Mineral** Egg Group and has a hatch counter of 15 cycles. Its evolution represents a shift from a multi-limbed rock creature to a compacted, bipedal heavyweight capable of rolling at high speeds.
