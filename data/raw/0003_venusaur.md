## Identity & Lore
Venusaur (Pokedex #003) is the fully evolved Seed Pokémon originating from **Generation I (Kanto)**. This massive, quadrupedal reptilian creature is distinguished by the colossal flower blooming on its back, which vividly colored petals indicate it is absorbing solar energy. Its natural habitat includes grasslands where it is frequently observed staying on the move to seek direct sunlight to fuel the flower's growth. While primarily known for its standard form, Venusaur possesses significant biological plasticity, capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Venusaur (gaining the Thick Fat ability) and achieving a **Gigantamax** form where its dorsal flower grows to cover its entire body.
