## Identity & Lore
Eevee (Pokedex #133) is the Normal-type Evolution Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for its unique biological instability, Eevee possesses an irregular genetic code that allows it to mutate instantly when exposed to the radiation of elemental stones or specific environmental conditions. This small, brown, quadrupedal mammal is highly adaptive and is often found in urban environments where it can interact with humans. While typically small in stature, Eevee is capable of undergoing **Gigantamax**, transforming into a colossal form with fluffy fur that entraps opponents. It is the distinct precursor to eight different evolutionary possibilities, collectively known as "Eeveelutions."
