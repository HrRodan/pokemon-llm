## Identity & Lore
Furret (Pokedex #162) is the Long Body Pokémon, a nimble Normal-type creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Distinguished by its cream and brown striped fur and extremely slender, elongated physique, it primarily inhabits grasslands. This Pokémon is hyper-specialized for burrowing; it digs intricate nests deep within the ground designed specifically to accommodate its narrow frame, making these burrows impenetrable to other Pokémon. While it appears cute and harmless, Furret is deceptively agile, capable of squirming through tight spaces to escape predators or ambush prey. It is the fully evolved form of the regional early-route mammal of the Johto region.
