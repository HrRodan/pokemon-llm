## Identity & Lore
Staryu (Pokédex #120) is the Star Shape Pokémon, an enigmatic Water-type creature introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Residing primarily in the depths of the sea, this golden-brown, echinoderm-like Pokémon is defined by the ruby-red core at its center, known as its "jewel." This core acts as a heart and communication device, flashing brightly at midnight or when the Pokémon is excited. Staryu possesses remarkable regenerative capabilities; as long as the central red core remains intact, it can regrow any severed limbs almost instantly. While it appears genderless and mechanical in behavior, it is an organic lifeform often found clustering with others of its species to mirror the stars in the night sky.

## Evolution & Biology
Staryu is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Starmie** when exposed to a **Water Stone**. Unlike many Pokémon that evolve via leveling, Staryu can evolve at any time provided the evolutionary stone is used, often encouraging trainers to wait until it learns specific moves like Hydro Pump or Recover before evolving. It belongs to the **Water 3** Egg Group and is strictly genderless, meaning it can only breed with Ditto.
