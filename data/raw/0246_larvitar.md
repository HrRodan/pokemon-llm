## Identity & Lore
Larvitar (Pokedex #246) is the **Rock Skin Pokémon**, a dual-type Rock/Ground creature first discovered in the **Johto** region (Generation II). Born deep underground, this small but heavy Pokémon has an insatiable appetite, driven to consume an entire mountain's worth of soil before it can enter its pupal stage. Its body is encased in green, rock-hard armor, protecting it as it burrows through the earth. As the base form of a **Pseudo-Legendary** line, Larvitar possesses immense latent potential. Upon fully evolving, it is capable of undergoing **Mega Evolution** into Mega Tyranitar. Additionally, in the Paldea region, a Paradox Pokémon known as **Iron Thorns** bears a striking mechanical resemblance to Larvitar's final evolution.

## Combat Profile

*   **Archetype:** Physical Setup Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** Larvitar possesses extreme defensive vulnerabilities due to its typing.

It can also function as a hazard setter with **Stealth Rock**.

## Evolution & Biology
Larvitar is the first stage of a prestigious 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Pupitar** starting at **Level 30**, a transition marked by the Pokémon creating a hard shell to prepare for its final metamorphosis. Pupitar subsequently evolves into the fearsome **Tyranitar** starting at **Level 55**. Larvitar belongs to the **Monster** Egg Group and has a notably high hatch counter (40 cycles), reflecting its slow growth rate and powerful lineage.
