## Identity & Lore
Togetic (Pokédex #176) is the **Happiness Pokémon**, a dual-type **Fairy/Flying** creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its small, white, humanoid appearance and triangular red and blue ring patterns, this Pokémon is rarely seen in the wild, preferring to inhabit peaceful forests. According to folklore, Togetic appears only before kindhearted and caring people to shower them with "joy dust" and happiness. It generally loses its spirit if it is not in the presence of compassionate individuals. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is the middle stage of a powerful evolutionary line that culminates in Togekiss.

## Combat Profile

*   **Archetype:** Bulky Special Support / Eviolite Tank.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is weak to **Poison, Steel, Rock, Electric, and Ice**. However, it possesses a **Double Resistance (0.25x damage) to Fighting** types, resists **Grass, Bug, and Dark**, and is completely **immune to Ground and Dragon**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its respectable Special Attack and bulk, key moves include **Dazzling Gleam** or **Moonblast** for Fairy-type STAB, **Air Slash** (which synergizes with its ability), **Roost** for reliable recovery, and **Nasty Plot** to sharply boost its offensive pressure. It is also a premier user of **Follow Me** and **Defog** in support roles.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Serene Grace:** Doubles the chance of a move's secondary effect occurring (e.g., doubling the flinch chance of Air Slash).
    *   **Hustle:** Boosts Attack by 50% but lowers accuracy by 20% (generally suboptimal for special attackers).
    *   **Super Luck (Hidden):** Increases the critical-hit ratio of moves.
