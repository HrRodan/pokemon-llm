## Identity & Lore
Vaporeon (Pokedex #134) is the Bubble Jet Pokémon, a pure Water-type entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its blue, quadrupedal form and a tail fin often mistaken for that of a mermaid, this Pokémon possesses a unique cellular structure almost identical to water molecules. This biological trait allows Vaporeon to invisibly melt into water, making it an ambush predator in its aquatic habitats. Ideally suited for urban and marine environments, it is one of the original branched evolutions of Eevee. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, it is renowned for its high durability and aquatic mastery.
