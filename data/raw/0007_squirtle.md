## Identity & Lore
Squirtle (Pokedex #007) is the Tiny Turtle Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). This small, blue reptilian typically inhabits areas near the water's edge. Biological records indicate that shortly after birth, its back swells and hardens into a tough, protective shell. It utilizes this physiology for defense and offense, capable of powerfully spraying foam or high-pressure water from its mouth.

## Combat Profile
In battle, Squirtle functions primarily as a defensive Tank relative to its evolutionary stage, utilizing high Defense (65) and Special Defense (64) stats to withstand hits while returning fire. As a pure Water-type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** techniques and **resists Fire, Water, Ice, and Steel** attacks. It typically possesses the ability Torrent, which significantly boosts the power of its Water-type moves when its health drops below one-third. Rare specimens may possess the Hidden Ability Rain Dish, which allows the Pokémon to gradually regenerate hit points during rainy weather.

## Evolution & Biology
Squirtle is the base form of a three-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into Wartortle starting at level 16, which subsequently evolves into the formidable Blastoise starting at level 36. It belongs to the Monster and Water 1 Egg Groups, allowing it to breed with a diverse range of amphibious and beast-like Pokémon.
