## Identity & Lore
Sandslash (Pokedex #028) is the formidable **Mouse Pokémon** known for its defensive capabilities and aggressive temperament. Indigenous to the **Kanto** region (Generation I), this Ground-type creature is characterized by its yellow hide and a back covered in tough, sharp spikes. These spikes are actually hardened sections of its hide, which it uses defensively by curling into a spiny ball when threatened, protecting its soft underbelly. In this state, Sandslash can roll at high speeds to escape or crash into enemies. It prefers inhabiting **rough-terrain** and arid environments where it can use its long claws to dig and slash. While this profile details the standard Ground-type form, it is worth noting that Sandslash possesses a regional variant in the Alola region, which adapts an Ice/Steel typing.
