## Identity & Lore
Omastar (Pokedex #139) is the Spiral Pokémon, a dual-type Rock/Water prehistoric creature native to the Generation I (Kanto) region. Resurrected from the Helix Fossil, this extinct cephalopod is characterized by its tentacles and a heavy, spiraled blue shell. According to scientific lore, Omastar eventually went extinct in ancient times because its shell grew too heavy, inhibiting its movement and making it impossible to catch prey effectively. It historically inhabited the primordial seas, using its sharp beak to crack open the shells of Shellder to feed.

Atk while attacking), and **Ice Beam** (essential coverage against Grass-types).

    *   **Weak Armor (Hidden):** When hit by a physical move, Defense is lowered by one stage, but Speed is increased by two stages.

## Evolution & Biology
Omastar is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Omanyte** when leveled up to **Level 40**. To acquire this line, a trainer typically must restore a Helix Fossil at a research laboratory. It belongs to the **Water 1** and **Water 3** Egg Groups, taking approximately 30 cycles to hatch.
