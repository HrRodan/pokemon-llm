## Identity & Lore
Arbok (Pokedex #024) is the Cobra Pokémon, a large, venomous serpent originally discovered in the Kanto region (Generation I). Distinctive for the frightening face-like pattern on its hood, Arbok uses this marking to intimidate prey and predators alike. While the standard pattern resembles an angry face, lore suggests that these warning markings differ from area to area, with six known variations existing globally. A dweller of grasslands and savannas, Arbok is known to be vengeful and persistent; once it identifies a target, it will hunt it relentlessly. While it does not possess any Mega Evolutions or Gigantamax forms, it is a recognizable staple of the villainous Team Rocket organization in historical records.

## Evolution & Biology
Arbok is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Ekans** starting at **Level 22**. There are no special items or conditions required for this transformation. Biologically, Arbok possesses incredible constriction strength, rumored to crush steel drums with its wrap. It belongs to the **Ground** and **Dragon** Egg Groups, allowing for diverse breeding combinations to pass down "Fang" moves (Ice Fang, Thunder Fang, Fire Fang).
