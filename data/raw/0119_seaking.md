## Identity & Lore
Seaking (Pokedex #119) is the Goldfish Pokémon first introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Distinguished by its brilliant red and white scales and the sharp, drill-like horn on its forehead, this Water-type is a common sight in rivers and at the water's edge. Seaking is deeply associated with the autumn season; during this time, they gather in large numbers and swim powerfully upstream against strong currents to spawn, a behavior reminiscent of real-world salmon. Male Seaking are known to perform elaborate courtship dances and will fiercely fight rivals using their horns to protect their nests and eggs. While it does not possess a Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Seaking is notable for its unique access to the Lightning Rod ability, granting it a specific niche in double battles.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 80, Attack 92, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 80, Speed 68.
*   **Archetype:** Physical Attacker / Anti-Electric Pivot.
*   **Type Matchups:** As a pure Water type, it is **weak to Grass and Electric** moves. It **resists Steel, Fire, Water, and Ice**. However, possessing the Lightning Rod ability grants it an **immunity to Electric-type attacks**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its higher Attack stat (92), an optimal moveset includes **Waterfall** for reliable STAB damage and **Megahorn** for high-power Bug-type coverage against Grass types. **Drill Run** provides essential Ground-type coverage to counter Electric types, while **Knock Off** offers utility by removing opponent items. **Swords Dance** is also a viable option to boost its offensive presence.
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Swift Swim:** Doubles the Pokémon's Speed stat during heavy rain, allowing it to function as a sweeper in Rain Dance teams.
    *   **Water Veil:** Prevents the Pokémon from getting a burn, ensuring its physical Attack stat remains unhindered by status conditions.
    *   **Lightning Rod (Hidden):** Draws in all single-target Electric-type moves used by opponents to itself, nullifying the damage and raising its Special Attack. This transforms a standard weakness into a tactical immunity.

## Evolution & Biology
Seaking is the final stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Goldeen** starting at **Level 33**. In the wild, it may occasionally carry **Mystic Water**, reinforcing its affinity for aquatic environments. Biologically, it belongs to the **Water 2** Egg Group, making it compatible for breeding with other fish-like Pokémon such as Magikarp and Remoraid.
