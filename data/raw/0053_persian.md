## Identity & Lore
Persian (Pokédex #053) is the elegant yet temperamental Classy Cat Pokémon introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Renowned for the jewel embedded in its forehead and its sleek yellow coat, this Pokémon inhabits urban environments where it is often kept by the wealthy, though its fickle meanness and tendency to scratch make it difficult to raise as a loyal pet. While this profile details the standard Normal-type form, Persian has a distinct regional variant in the Alola region (Dark-type) and shares a pre-evolution with the Galarian species, Perrserker.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 65, Attack 70, Defense 60, Sp. Atk 65, Sp. Def 65, Speed 115.
*   **Archetype:** Fast Utility Pivot / Technician Attacker.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a complete **immunity to Ghost**.
*   **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its blistering Speed (115) and ability to boost weaker moves, key tactical options include **Fake Out** (for priority flinching), **U-turn** (to pivot out of unfavorable matchups), **Play Rough** (for coverage against Fighting-types), and **Taunt** (to shut down slower status users).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Limber:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming paralyzed, ensuring its high speed remains compromised.
    *   **Technician:** Increases the power of moves with a base power of 60 or less by 50%, making low-power moves significantly more threatening.
    *   **Unnerve (Hidden):** Makes the opposing team too nervous to eat Berries during battle.

## Evolution & Biology
Persian is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves from **Meowth** starting at **Level 28**. Unlike its Alolan counterpart which requires high friendship, the Kantonian Persian relies purely on combat experience to evolve. It belongs to the **Field** (Ground) Egg Group and takes approximately 20 egg cycles to hatch.
