## Identity & Lore
Spinarak (Pokedex #167) is the String Spit Pokémon, a patient arachnid originating from Generation II (Johto). This green, forest-dwelling creature is characterized by the distinct face-like marking on its back, which serves as a deterrent to predators while it waits motionless for prey. Known for its ambush tactics, Spinarak spins intricate webs using fine, durable silk produced from its mouth and lies in the same pose for days until unsuspecting targets wander close. Although small, its venom is potent enough to subdue its victims.

## Evolution & Biology
Spinarak is part of a 2-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Ariados** starting at **Level 22**. It belongs to the **Bug** Egg Group and hatches relatively quickly (15 cycles). Uniquely, Spinarak shoots web from its mouth rather than its abdomen, a trait that distinguishes it biologically from real-world arachnids.
