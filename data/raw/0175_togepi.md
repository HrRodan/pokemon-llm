## Identity & Lore
Togepi (#175) is the **Spike Ball Pokémon** introduced in **Generation II (Johto)**. Small, round, and white, this Fairy-type Pokémon appears to be a small creature permanently nestled inside an eggshell decorated with red and blue shapes. Biologically classified as a **Baby Pokémon**, Togepi is famous for its ability to siphon positive emotions like joy and compassion from people and Pokémon, storing this energy inside its shell to share with others. According to folklore, it is a symbol of good fortune and will share good luck with those who treat it with kindness. While primarily found in forests, it is often associated with travelers and trainers who raise it from an egg. It serves as the base form for the formidable Togekiss line.

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 35, Attack 20, Defense 65, Sp. Atk 40, Sp. Def 65, Speed 20.
* **Archetype:** Little Cup Defensive Support / Eviolite Wall.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Fairy-type, it is **weak to Poison and Steel**. It **resists Fighting, Bug, and Dark** attacks and possesses a complete **immunity to Dragon-type** moves.
* **Move Selection:** Capitalizing on its decent bulk for a baby Pokémon and Special Attack potential, key moves include **Dazzling Gleam** (STAB), **Nasty Plot** (to boost Sp. Atk), **Baton Pass** (to transfer boosts to teammates), and **Soft-Boiled** (for reliable recovery).
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Hustle:** Boosts Attack by 50% but lowers accuracy by 20% (generally suboptimal for this special attacker).
    *   **Serene Grace:** Doubles the chance of a move's secondary effect occurring (highly tactical for moves with status effects).
    *   **Super Luck (Hidden):** Increases the critical-hit ratio of moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Togepi is the first stage of a 3-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Togetic** when leveled up with **High Friendship** (Happiness value of 160 or higher). Togetic can subsequently evolve into the final form, **Togekiss**, when exposed to a **Shiny Stone**. As a Baby Pokémon, Togepi belongs to the **No-Eggs** egg group and cannot breed until it evolves; however, its evolution line falls into the Flying and Fairy egg groups. It hatches quickly compared to other species, with a hatch counter of 10 cycles.
