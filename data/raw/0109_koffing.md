## Identity & Lore
Koffing (Pokedex #109) is the Poison Gas Pokémon, a spherical, toxic entity introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Residing primarily in urban areas plagued by pollution, this Pokémon stores highly volatile, lighter-than-air gases within its thin, purple skin, allowing it to hover indiscriminately. According to its biology, mixing the raw toxins inside its body renders it prone to spontaneous explosion without warning. While it typically evolves into the standard Weezing, specimens in the Galar region adapt to local industrialization, evolving into the Poison/Fairy-type **Galarian Weezing**, which features distinctive smokestack "top hats."

## Combat Profile
* **Stats:** HP 40, Attack 65, Defense 95, Sp. Atk 60, Sp. Def 45, Speed 35.
* **Archetype:** Physical Tank / Utility Disruptor.
* **Type Matchups:** As a pure Poison-type, it generally struggles against **Psychic** and **Ground** moves while resisting **Grass, Fighting, Poison, Bug, and Fairy**. However, its defensive profile is heavily dictated by its Ability choice; with **Levitate**, it gains a total immunity to Ground-type attacks, leaving it with only a single weakness to Psychic.
* **Move Selection:** Utilizing its high physical bulk and diverse support pool, Koffing is best utilized with **Sludge Bomb** for consistent STAB damage, **Will-O-Wisp** to cripple physical attackers, **Pain Split** for sustainability, and **Clear Smog** to reset opponent stat boosts. Alternatively, it can utilize **Explosion** to inflict massive damage before fainting.
* **Abilities:**
    *   **Levitate:** Grants full immunity to all Ground-type moves and spikes.
    *   **Neutralizing Gas:** A potent competitive ability that suppresses the effects of all other Pokémon's abilities on the field.
    *   **Stench (Hidden):** Grants a small chance to cause the target to flinch when hit by damaging moves.

## Evolution & Biology
Koffing is the first stage of a two-stage evolutionary line. It evolves into **Weezing** starting at **Level 35**. If evolved within the Galar region, it will instead take on the form of **Galarian Weezing**. It belongs to the **Indeterminate** (Amorphous) Egg Group and hatches after approximately 20 egg cycles.
