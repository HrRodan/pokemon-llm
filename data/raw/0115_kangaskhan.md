## Identity & Lore
Kangaskhan (Pokedex #115) is the Parent Pokémon, a large, bipedal creature identified by its brown coloration and the infant it carries in its pouch. Native to the **grasslands** of **Generation I (Kanto)**, this Pokémon is defined by its maternal instinct. The infant rarely ventures out of the mother's protective pouch until it is three years old, and the mother will exhibit extreme ferocity to protect its young. While strictly a single-stage Pokémon in its base form, it is historically notable for its capability to undergo **Mega Evolution** into **Mega Kangaskhan**, a state where the infant grows rapidly and fights alongside the mother, utilizing the Parental Bond ability.
