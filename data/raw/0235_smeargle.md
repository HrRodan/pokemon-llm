## Identity & Lore
Smeargle (Pokedex #235) is the Painter Pokémon, a unique Normal-type creature introduced in Generation II (Johto). Characterized by its bipedal, white, canine appearance and a long tail that functions like a paintbrush, Smeargle resides primarily in urban environments. A special fluid oozes from the tip of its tail, which it uses to paint symbols and mark its territory; notably, the color of this fluid changes depending on the Pokémon's mood. While it has no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax form, Smeargle is biologically distinct due to its ability to copy almost any move used by an opponent, making it a subject of great interest for move research and competitive breeding.

## Combat Profile
*   **Stats:** HP 55, Attack 20, Defense 35, Sp. Atk 20, Sp. Def 45, Speed 75.
*   **Archetype:** Dedicated Utility Support / Hazard Setter.
*   **Type Matchups:** It is **weak to Fighting** and possesses a natural **Immunity to Ghost**. As a pure Normal type, it has no resistances.
*   **Move Selection:** Despite its abysmal offensive stats, Smeargle is one of the most versatile Pokémon in existence due to its signature move, **Sketch**, which allows it to permanently learn the last move used by a target. Consequently, its optimal moveset borrows the best utility from other species, typically including **Spore** (for guaranteed sleep), **Sticky Web** (to lower enemy speed), **Stealth Rock** (hazard setting), and **Baton Pass** (to transfer stat changes).
*   **Abilities:**
    *   **Own Tempo:** Prevents the Pokémon from becoming confused and blocks Intimidate.
    *   **Technician:** Powers up moves with a base power of 60 or less (rarely utilized due to low Attack stats).
    *   **Moody (Hidden):** A volatile ability that sharply raises one stat and lowers another at the end of every turn, making Smeargle unpredictable in prolonged battles.

## Evolution & Biology
Smeargle is a standalone species and is not part of an evolutionary line; it does not evolve from or into any other Pokémon. It belongs to the **Ground (Field)** Egg Group, making it an essential "bridge" parent in breeding chains because it can Sketch specific moves and pass them down to offspring of different species via Egg Moves. It hatches after approximately 20 egg cycles.
