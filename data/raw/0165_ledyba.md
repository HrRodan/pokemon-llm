## Identity & Lore
Ledyba (Pokedex #165) is the Five Star Pokémon introduced in Generation II (Johto). This dual-type Bug/Flying creature resides primarily in forests and is characterized by the five black spots on its red wing covers. A naturally timid species, Ledyba is frightened to move when alone and relies heavily on group dynamics to feel secure. It secretes an aromatic fluid from its legs to communicate its location to others, gathering in swarms to stay active and safe. While it possesses no Mega Evolution or Gigantamax forms, it is well-known for its role in early-game Johto exploration.
