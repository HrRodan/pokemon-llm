## Identity & Lore
Drowzee (Pokedex #096) is the Hypnosis Pokémon, a pure Psychic-type introduced in Generation I (Kanto). Resembling a bipedal tapir, its design is inspired by the Japanese mythological spirit *Baku*, known for devouring nightmares. This yellow, humanoid creature inhabits grasslands and is infamous for putting enemies to sleep to feast on their dreams. Drowzee has a refined palate, preferring the "fun" dreams of children over the dreams of adults, and it may become physically ill if it consumes a "bad" dream. It senses dreams through its nose and is known to twitch its nose when it detects a sleeping victim nearby.
