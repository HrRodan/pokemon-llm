# Pokémon Knowledge Dataset
This dataset contains semantically dense, RAG-optimized profiles for Pokémon, Moves, and Items. It combines raw structured data from PokeAPI with natural language descriptions generated by Google Gemini 3 Flash.
## Dataset Structure
### Configuration: `pokemon-knowledge`
This configuration contains the full knowledge base containing all three categories of data.
*   **Split**: `train`
*   **Total Records**: ~4,400+ entries
### Data Fields
Each row represents a single entity (a Pokémon, a Move, or an Item) and contains the following columns:
*   **`category`** (`string`): The type of entity. Can be one of:
    *   `pokemon`: Pokémon species and forms.
    *   `move`: Battle moves (attacks, status moves).
    *   `item`: Held items, medicine, key items, etc.
*   **`id`** (`int64`): The unique numeric identifier from PokeAPI.
*   **`name`** (`string`): The identifier name (e.g., `bulbasaur`, `thunderbolt`, `potion`).
*   **`description`** (`string`): A generated Markdown profile containing rich semantic information, lore, competitive analysis, and usage details. This field is optimized for vector search and RAG applications.
*   **`json`** (`string`): The raw JSON data source used to generate the description, providing a ground truth reference. The data was extracted from the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/).
## Data Generation Process
The `description` field was created using a Multi-Agent LLM pipeline powered by **Google Gemini 1.5 Flash**. The goal was to transform raw JSON statistics into natural language text that includes "World Knowledge" (lore, competitive viability, common usage) usually missing from raw databases.
Three distinct personas were used for generation:
### 1. Pokémon Data Analyst & Lorekeeper (`category: pokemon`)
*   **Goal**: Create a profile optimized for identification and combat analysis.
*   **Prompt Strategy**:
    *   Combines Biology (Habitat, Genus) with competitive Stats.
    *   Explicitly analyzes **Type Matchups**, including 4x weaknesses.
    *   Suggests **Movesets** based on the Pokémon's highest stats.
    *   Identifies **Archetypes** (e.g., "Physical Sweeper", "Wall").
### 2. Battle Mechanics Analyst (`category: move`)
*   **Goal**: Create a profile for battle utility and distribution.
*   **Prompt Strategy**:
    *   Describes the **Visual Execution** of the move for thematic search.
    *   Analyzes **Competitive Roles** (e.g., "Reliable STAB", "Utility", "Nuke").
    *   Lists **Prominent Users** (Pokémon that commonly run this move).
    *   Highlights synergy with Abilities (e.g., Iron Fist, Strong Jaw).
### 3. Inventory Manager & Competitive Analyst (`category: item`)
*   **Goal**: Contextualize items beyond their basic effect.
*   **Prompt Strategy**:
    *   Categorizes items (Consumable, Competitive Held Item, Evolution Material).
    *   Interprets **Cost** and **Availability**.
    *   Explains **Competitive Viability** (e.g., "Competitive Staple" vs "Niche" vs "Playthrough only").
