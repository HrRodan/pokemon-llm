Characterized by its yellow fur and jagged, lightning-bolt tail, this quadruped typically inhabits **forest** environments. Biological lore indicates that when several of these Pokémon gather, their combined electricity can build up intense power, potentially causing lightning storms. While standard specimens appear as described, Pikachu possesses a unique **Gigantamax** potential (typically involving specific factors not listed in standard forms) and is the mascot of the franchise. It is arguably the most recognized Pokémon in existence.\n",

       "It has a wide distribution (89 learners), primarily consisting of pure Electric-type Pokémon and regional variants.\n",
       "* **Prominent Users:** It is the signature early-game move for **Pikachu**, and is also learned by legendary Pokémon such as **Zapdos**, **Raikou**, and the speed-demon **Regieleki**. \n",
       "* **Coverage Utility:** Occasionally seen on unconventional Pokémon like **Alolan Golem** (as a STAB option via Galvanize) or **Stunfisk** and **Melmetal** during their lower-level movepools.\n",
       "* **Acquisition:** Primarily learned via **Level-up**; it is rarely featured as a TM or TR, as it is intended to be replaced by more powerful Electric-type maneuvers as the Pokémon grows."
