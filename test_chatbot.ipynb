The guidance says for mixed logic like (A OR B) AND C, we must split into two queries.\\n\\nSo we choose:\\n\\nA: type_1=\\'fire\\'.\\nB: type_2=\\'fire\\'.\\nC: defense<100.\\n\\nWe do Query1: get ids where type_1=\\'fire\\' AND defense<100.\\nQuery2: ids where type_2=\\'fire\\' AND defense<100.\\nThen combine ids, unique.\\n\\nThen Query3: select name, generation, defense from pokemons where id in combined IDs order by name.\\n\\nWe need to produce the result using 3 calls.\\n\\nWe first need to check if the table has \\'id\\'.
